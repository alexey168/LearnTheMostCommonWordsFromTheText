How did you get through it?

170
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,392
He might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers.

171
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,144
- Say her...
- Leg?

Heh. That's one way of going through it,
yeah.

174

- You actually broke her watch?
- Mm.

175
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,363
Barry, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

176

You probably think it's about making
love with your socks on, but it isn't.

Anyway...

180

You know what's scary? What if
there's only one woman for everybody?

181
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:24,057
I mean, what if you get one
woman, and that's it?

182
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:29,104
Unfortunately, in my case,
there was only one woman for her.

183

What are you talking about?
One woman.

184
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:37,028
That's like saying there's only
one flavor of ice cream for you.

185
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,949
Let me tell you something, Ross.
There's lots of flavors out there.

186
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:45,578
There's rocky road and cookie dough
and bing cherry vanilla.

187
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:50,709
You can get them with jimmies
or nuts or whipped cream.

188

want that fifth date?

Yeah, I do.

00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:17,347
I know this is going to sound
unbelievably selfish on my part...

147
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,767
...but were you planning on bringing
up the whole baby/lesbian thing?

148
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,687
Because I think it might take
some of the heat off me.

149
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:30,652
What that Rachel did to her life.
We ran into her parents at the club.

150
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,821
They were not playing very well.

151
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,282
I'm not gonna tell you
what they spent on that wedding...

152
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,034
...but $40,000 is a lot of money.

153
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:44,666
Well, at least she had the chance
to leave a man at the altar.

154
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,589
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

155
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:54,092
- It's an expression.
- No, it's not.

156
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,468
Don't listen to your mother.

157
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,637
You're independent
and you always have been.

and you were chubby...

...and you had no friends,
you were just fine.

160

You'd read alone in your room.
And your puzzles...

161
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:15,780
Look, there are people, like Ross,
who need to shoot for the stars.

162
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,825
With his museum and his papers
getting published.

163

Other people are satisfied
with staying where they are.

00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:25,165
I'm telling you, these are the people
who never get cancer.

165
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:32,213
And I read about these women
trying to have it all, and I thank God...

166
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,425
...our little Harmonica
doesn't seem to have that problem.

167
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,847
So, Ross, what's going on with you?

168
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:45,977
Any stories? No news, no little
anecdotes to share with the folks?

169
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,270
Okay, okay.

Ahem. Look, I, uh... I realize you guys
have been wondering...

...what exactly happened
between Carol and me.

172
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,865
And so, well, here's the deal.

173
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,370
Carol's a lesbian.

174
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,874
She's living with a woman named Susan.

175
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,921
She's pregnant with my child.

176
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,466
And she and Susan
are going to raise the baby.

177

They take their time.

They get the job done.

you can't change your parents.

when you're twins.

- You're a twin?
- Oh, yeah. We don't speak.

driven, career-type.

- She's a waitress.

You don't have any of this.

have an imaginary friend...

You know, as someone
who's recently been dumped.

205
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,461
Well, you may want to steer clear
of the word "dumped."

206
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,091
Chances are he's going to be this
broken shell of a man. You know?

So you should try not to look too terrific.

and I'll give Barry back his ring.

- No.

It's because I wanted
to go out with her too.

you were seeing Bernie Spellman...

Chandler?

13
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,630
Miss Tedlock,
you're looking lovely today.

14
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:33,383
May I say that is a very
flattering sleeve length on you?

15
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,219
Yes.

16
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:39,556
Well, Mr. Costilick would like you to stop
by his office at the end of the day.

17
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,727
Oh, listen, if this is about those prank
memos, I had nothing to do with them.

18
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,230
Really, nothing at all. Really.

19
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:47,606
Nothing.

20
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,945
Hey, you guys. You guys.

21
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,948
Chandler's coming, and he says
he has this incredible news.

22
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,534
So when he gets here,
let's all act like, you know...

23
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,244
- Hey.
GROUP: Hey.

24
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:03,038
Never mind.
But it was gonna be really good.

25
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,791
ROSS: What's going on?
RACHEL: What's up?

26
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,460
It's a typical day at work.
I'm inputting my numbers...

27
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,462
...and Big Al calls me into his office...

28
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,632
...and tells me he wants to make me
processing supervisor.

29
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,968
- That is great!
- Congratulations.

30
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,387
So I quit.

31
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,222
BOTH:
Why?

32
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,641
Why?
This was supposed to be a temp job.

33
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,727
Yeah, Chandler,
you've been there for five years.

34
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,312
I know, but if I took it this...

35
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,149
...it'd be like admitting
that this is what I actually do.

36
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,608
So was it a lot more money?

37
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,403
Doesn't matter. I just don't want
to be one of those guys...

38
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:38,157
...that's in his office until 12:00 at night
worrying about the WENUS.

39
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,619
"The WENUS"?

40
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:46,665

It's a processing term.

41
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,668
Oh, that WENUS.

42
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,045
So, what are you gonna do?

43
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,423
I don't know. That's the thing.
I don't know.

44
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,675
I'm not gonna figure it out
working there.

45

Oh! I have something you can do.

a restaurant...

48
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,021
...and he's looking for a head chef.

49
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,983
Um, hi there.

Hi.

51
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:17,654
Oh, yeah, I know. You're a chef, I know,
and I thought of you first.

52
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:21,200
But, um, Chandler's the one
who needs a job right now, so...

53
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,163
Yeah, I just don't have a lot
of chefing experience.

54
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,373
Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.

55
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,461
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Well, what kind of food is he looking for?

56
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,631
He wants to do something eclectic,
so he's looking for someone...

57
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,799
...who can, you know,
create the entire menu.

58
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,885
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, I know.

Thanks, Pheeb. I just don't really
see myself in a big white hat.

Okay.

through this shirt?

No, but don't worry.
I'm sure they're still there.

Where you going, Mr. Suit-ey Man?

Well, I have an appointment
to see Dr. Robert Pilman...

So great. He showed me
where the restaurant's gonna be.

It's this cute little place on 10th Street.

Monday night. Kind of like an audition.

- Where have you been?
- I just got back from the vet.

121
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,603
She's not gonna make you wear
a big plastic cone, is she?

122
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,650
She says Marcel's humping thing
is not a phase.

123
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:09,070
Apparently, he's reached sexual maturity.

124
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,157
Hey, he beat you!

125
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:20,916
She says, as time goes on,
he'll start getting aggressive and violent.

126
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,584
What does this mean?

127
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,421
I have to give him up.

128
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,650
I can't believe it. This sucks!

129
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:50,320
You just got him.
How could he be an adult already?

130
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,782
I know, I know.
One day he's this little thing...

131
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,451
...and before you know it,
he's this little thing...

132
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,246
...I can't get off my leg.

133
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,457
Isn't there any way you can keep him?

134
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,667
No. No.

135
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:07,671
The vet said that unless he's in a place
where he has regular access...

136
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:12,092
...to some monkey loving...

137
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,136
...he's just gonna get vicious.

138
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,181
I just gotta get him into a zoo.

139
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,852
- How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
- I know that one!

140
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,277
No, that's popes into a Volkswagen.

141
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:36,241
We're applying to a lot of them.
Our first choice would be a state zoo.

142
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,035
You know, like, uh, San Diego.

143
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,371
Right?

144
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:45,875
But that may just be a pipe dream
because he's out-of-state.

145
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,507
My vet knows someone at Miami,
so that's a possibility.

146
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:56,177
But that's two blocks from the beach.
It's a total party zoo.

147
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,017
- Hey.
CHANDLER: Hey.

148
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,977
- Hi.
- We found the girl!

149
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,770
- What?
- Did you call the cops?

150
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,522
Nope. We took her to lunch.

151
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,400
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.

152
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,738
Are you insane?
This woman stole from you!

00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,490
She stole! She's a stealer!

154
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:21,369
After you're with this woman
for 10 minutes, you forget all that.

155
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,874
I mean, she's this astounding person...

156
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,251
...with this amazing spirit!

157
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,546
Yeah, which she probably stole
from some cheerleader!

158
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,217
- Take off their hats.
- Popes in a Volkswagen!

159
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,677
Mm-hm.

160
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,681
I love that joke.

161
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:50,190
- No way! No way did you do this!
- Monana was very brave.

162
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,941
It was so wild.

163
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:55,070
We told them we were
the Gunnersons in room 615...

164
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:59,115
...only to find out the Boston Celtics
had the entire sixth floor!

165
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:02,786
So when they caught on to the fact
that we're short and have breasts...

166
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:06,998
They threw us out.
I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!

167
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,167
Go, Monana!

168
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:14,964
Well, you ladies are not
the only ones living the dream.

I don't know. Don't wait up.

Oh, by the way...

171
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,810
...tomorrow we're auditioning
for a Broadway show.

There's an open call for Cats.

174
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,192
I'm thinking we go down there,
sing "Memories"...

175
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,445
...and make complete fools of ourselves.
What do you say?

176
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,490
No, no, no.

177
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,326
Remember who
you're dealing with here. Ha.

178
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,663
I'm not like you. I can't even
stand in front of a tap class.

179
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,832
That's because of
your Amish background.

180
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,920
- What?
- Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?

181
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,171
Right.

182
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,842
Till I bought a blow dryer.
Then I was shunned.

183
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,095
I was just like you.

184
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:06,224
And then one day, I saw a movie
that changed my life.

185
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,310
- Did you ever see Dead Poets Society?
- Uh-huh.

186
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:13,148
I thought that movie was so incredibly...

187
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,357
...boring!

188
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,068
I mean, that thing at the end
where the kid...

189
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,821
...kills himself because
he can't be in the play?

190
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:21,990
What was that?

191
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:26,786
It's like, "Kid, wait a year.
Leave home, do some community theater!"

192
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,790
I walked out of there, and I thought:

193
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,378
"Now, that's two hours of my life
that I'm never getting back!"

194
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,257
And that scared me more than
all the other crap I was afraid to do.

195
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,092
Wow.

196
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,470
Then I would definitely
not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.

We didn't get into Scranton.

is harder on, me or him.

Well, it's technically not a zoo per se.

It's, uh, more of an interactive
wildlife experience.

Does he, uh, fight with other animals?

No, no. He's very docile.

Um, how is he at handling small objects?
