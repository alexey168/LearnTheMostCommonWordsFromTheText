3
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,243
Easy, boy.

4
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,277
What do you expect?
They're savages.

5
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,779
One lot steals a goat from another lot,

6
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,240
before you know it
they're ripping each other to pieces.

7
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,826
I've never seen wildlings do a thing like this.

8
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,120
I never seen a thing like this,
not ever in my life.

9
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,414
How close did you get?

10
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,959
- Close as any man would.
- We should head back to the Wall.

11
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:34,046
Do the dead frighten you?

12
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,299
Our orders were to track the wildlings.

13
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:39,635
We tracked them.
They won't trouble us no more.

14
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,179
You don't think he'll ask us how they died?

15
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,225
Get back on your horse.

16
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,441
Whatever did it to them
could do it to us.

17
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,151
They even killed the children.

18
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,112
It's a good thing we're not children.

19
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,283
You want to run away south,
run away.

20
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,328
Of course,
they will behead you as a deserter.

21
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,580
If I don't catch you first.

22
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,251
Get back on your horse.

23
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,712
I won't say it again.

24
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,329
Your dead men seem
to have moved camp.

25
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,706
They were here.

26
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:55,753
See where they went.

27
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,135
What is it?

28
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:46,554
It's...

29
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,091
Go on, Father's watching.

30
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,011
And your mother.

31
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:05,521
Fine work, as always.
Well done.

32
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,314
Thank you.

33
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,277
I love the detail that you've managed
to get in these corners.

34
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,195
Quite beautiful.

35
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,197
The stitching...

36
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,533
Oh, no, no, no. This stitch is very...

37
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,203
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you.

38
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,138
And which one of you
was a marksman at ten?

39
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,682
Keep practicing, Bran.

40
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,811
Go on.

41
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:48,605
Don't think too much, Bran.

42
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,192
Relax your bow arm.

43
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,832
- Quick, Bran!
- Faster.

44
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,419
Lord Stark!

45
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:13,505
My lady.

46
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,759
A guardsman just rode in from the hills.

47
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,887
They've captured a deserter
from the Night's Watch.

48
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,309
Get the lads to saddle their horses.

49
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,394
Do you have to?

50
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,605
He swore an oath, Cat.

51
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,732
Law is law, my lady.

52
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,818
Tell Bran he's coming too.

53
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,322
Ned.

54
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,741
Ten is too young
to see such things.

55
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,409
He won't be a boy forever.

56
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,080
And winter is coming.

57
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,434
Good lad, go run back and get the rest.

58
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,150
White walkers.

59
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,986
I saw the white walkers.

60
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,988
White walkers.

61
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:23,158
The white walkers, I saw them.

62
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,585
I know I broke my oath.

63
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,296
And I know I'm a deserter.

64
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,842
I should have gone back to the Wall
and warned them, but...

65
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,011
I saw what I saw.

66
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:44,680
I saw the white walkers.

67
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,475
People need to know.

68
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,479
If you can get word to my family...

69
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,898
tell them I'm no coward.

70
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,984
Tell them I'm sorry.

71
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,669
Forgive me, Lord.

72
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,217
In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

73
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,303
- the first of his name...
- Don't look away.

74
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,349
- ...King of the Andals and the First Men...
- Father will know if you do.

75
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,726
...Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and protector of the realm,

76
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,729
I, Eddard of the House Stark,

77
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:36,398
Lord of Winterfell
and Warden of the North,

78
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,984
sentence you to die.

79
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,459
You did well.

80
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,113
You understand why I did it?

81
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,115
Jon said he was a deserter.

82
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:29,785
But do you understand
why I had to kill him?

83
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,537
"Our way is the old way"?

84
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:36,833
The man who passes the sentence
should swing the sword.

85
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,254
Is it true he saw the white walkers?

86
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,259
The white walkers have been gone
for thousands of years.

87
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,928
So he was lying?

88
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,768
A madman sees what he sees.

89
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,629
What is it?

90
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,675
Mountain lion?

91
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,387
There are no mountain lions
in these woods.

92
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,352
It's a freak.

93
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,021
It's a direwolf.

94
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,532
Tough old beast.

95
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,912
There are no direwolves
south of the Wall.

96
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,081
Now there are five.

97
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,376
You want to hold it?

98
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,423
Where will they go?

99
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,258
Their mother's dead.

100
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:51,927
They don't belong down here.

101
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:55,847
Better a quick death.
They won't last without their mother.

102
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,974
- Right. Give it here.
- No!

103
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,768
Put away your blade.

104
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,813
- I take orders from your father, not you.
- Please, Father!

105
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,731
I'm sorry, Bran.

106
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,899
Lord Stark?

107
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,194
There are five pups.

108
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,656
One for each of the Stark children.

109
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,283
The direwolf is the sigil of your house.

110
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,870
They were meant to have them.

111
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,294
You will train them yourselves.

112
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,296
You will feed them yourselves.

113
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:31,299
And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.

114
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:41,643
What about you?

115
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,187
I'm not a Stark.

116
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,398
Get on.

117
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:57,909
What is it?

118
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:05,625
The runt of the litter.
That one's yours, Snow.

119
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,980
As your brother,
I feel it's my duty to warn you...

120
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,234
you worry too much.

121
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,695
- It's starting to show.
- And you never worry about anything.

122
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,909
When we were seven and you jumped off
the cliffs at Casterly Rock,

123
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:25,413
100-foot drop into the water...
you were never afraid.

124
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,166
There was nothing to be afraid of
until you told Father.

125
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,878
"We're Lannisters.
Lannisters don't act like fools."

126
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,843
- What if Jon Arryn told someone?
- But who would he tell?

127
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,345
My husband.

128
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:44,224
If he told the king, both our heads would be
skewered on the city gates by now.

129
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,895
Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know,
it died with him.

130
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,606
And Robert will choose
a new Hand of the King,

131
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:55,318
someone to do his job while he's off
fucking boars and hunting whores.

132
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,112
Or is it the other way around?

133
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,991
And life will go on.

134
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,702
You should be the Hand of the King.

135
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:06,413
That's an honor I can do without.

136
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,164
Their days are too long,

137
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,958
their lives are too short.

138
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,707
All these years,

139
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,960
and I still feel like an outsider
when I come here.

140
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,464
You have five northern children.

141
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:01,009
You're not an outsider.

142
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:03,637
I wonder if the old gods agree.

143
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,765
It's your gods with all the rules.

144
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,857
I am so sorry, my love.

145
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:20,612
- Tell me.
- There was a raven from King's Landing.

146
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,282
Jon Arryn is dead.

147
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,910
A fever took him.

148
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,957
I know he was like a father to you.

149
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:38,129
- Your sister, the boy?
- They both have their health,

150
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,256
gods be good.

151
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:51,851
The raven brought more news.

152
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,356
The king rides for Winterfell...

153
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,193
with the queen and all the rest of them.

154
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,446
If he's coming this far north...

155
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:07,033
there's only one thing he's after.

156
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,537
You can always say no, Ned.

157
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:22,590
We'll need plenty of candles
for Lord Tyrion's chamber.

158
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:26,469
- I'm told he reads all night.
- I'm told he drinks all night.

159
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,764
How much could he possibly drink?
A man of his...

160
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,433
stature?

161
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:34,436
We've brought up eight barrels of ale
from the cellar.

162
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:35,770
Perhaps we'll find out.

163
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,731
In any case, candles.

164
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,781
Why is your mother so dead set on us
getting pretty for the king?

165
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,659
It's for the queen, I bet.
I hear she's a sleek bit of mink.

166
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,828
I hear the prince is a right royal prick.

167
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:55,415
Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab
with his right royal prick.

168
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,461
Go on, Tommy, shear him good.

169
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,880
He's never met a girl he likes better
than his own hair.

170
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:41,544
Gods, but they grow fast.

171
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,507
Brandon!

172
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:48,635
I saw the king.
He's got hundreds of people.

173
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,846
How many times have I told you?
No climbing.

174
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:54,933
But he's coming right now, down our road.

175
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,359
I want you to promise me,

176
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,152
no more climbing.

177
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,158
I promise.

178
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:17,372
- Do you know what?
- What?

179
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:19,707
You always look at your feet
before you lie.

180
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,628
Run and find your father.

181
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,797
Tell him the king is close.

182
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:13,595
Where's Arya?
Sansa, where's your sister?

183
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:26,065
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Oh.

184
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,109
What are you doing with that on?

185
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,614
Go on.

186
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:35,658
Move!

187
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,659
Your Grace.

188
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,832
You've got fat.

189
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:19,470
- Cat!
- Your Grace.

190
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,061
Nine years... Why haven't I seen you?
Where the hell have you been?

191
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:30,732
Guarding the North for you, Your Grace.
Winterfell is yours.

192
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,196
- Where's the Imp?
- Will you shut up?

193
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:38,823
Who have we here?

194
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,534
You must be Robb.

195
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,622
My, you're a pretty one.

196
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:49,917
Your name is?

197
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,419
Arya.

198
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:55,214
Oh, show us your muscles.

199
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,843
You'll be a soldier.

200
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:04,140
That's Jaime Lannister,
the queen's twin brother.

201
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,392
Would you please shut up?

202
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:19,822
My queen.

203
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,949
Take me to your crypt.
I want to pay my respects.

204
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:23,910
We've been riding for a month, my love.

205
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,037
Surely the dead can wait.

206
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:28,039
Ned.

207
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,925
Where's the Imp?

208
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,430
Where is our brother?

209
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,307
Go and find the little beast.

210
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,353
Tell me about Jon Arryn.

211
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,815
One minute he was fine and then...

212
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:57,777
burned right through him,
whatever it was.

213
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,947
I loved that man.

214
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,407
We both did.

215
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:06,869
He never had to teach you much,
but me? You remember me at 16?

216
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,830
All I wanted to do

217
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:11,582
was crack skulls and fuck girls.

218
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,836
- He showed me what was what.
- Aye.

219
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:17,588
Don't look at me like that.
It's not his fault I didn't listen.

220
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:24,178
I need you, Ned,

221
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,974
down at King's Landing, not up here
where you're no damn use to anybody.

222
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:31,644
Lord Eddard Stark...

223
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,064
I would name you the Hand of the King.

224
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,654
I'm not worthy of the honor.

225
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,197
I'm not trying to honor you.

226
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,032
I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom

227
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:48,870
while I eat, drink and whore my way
to an early grave.

228
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:50,830
Damn it, Ned, stand up.

229
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:54,333
You helped me win the Iron Throne,

230
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,170
now help me keep the damn thing.

231
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,672
We were meant to rule together.

232
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,634
If your sister had lived,
we'd have been bound by blood.

233
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:06,179
Well, it's not too late.

234
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:09,515
I have a son,
you have a daughter.

235
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,019
We'll join our houses.

236
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:41,172
It is true what they say
about the northern girls.

237
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,724
Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?

238
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,476
I did hear something about that.

239
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,770
And the queen and her twin brother.

240
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:58,940
They say that he is the most handsome man
in the Seven Kingdoms.

241
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:00,942
And the other brother?

242
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:04,278
- The queen has two brothers?
- There's the pretty one...

243
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:07,198
and there's the clever one.

244
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:09,992
Mmm...

245
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,370
I hear they call him the Imp.

246
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:14,288
I hear he hates that nickname.

247
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:17,792
Oh? I hear he's more than earned it.

248
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:20,169
I hear he's a drunken little lecher,

249
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,755
prone to all manner of perversions.

250
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,674
Clever girl.

251
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,261
We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.

252
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,180
Have you?

253
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,682
- Already?
- Oh!

254
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,312
The gods gave me one blessing.

255
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:45,695
- Don't get up.
- My lord.

256
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:49,490
Should I explain to you the meaning of
a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?

257
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,659
You have much to teach me, no doubt,

258
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:54,954
but our sister craves your attention.

259
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:57,665
She has odd cravings, our sister.

260
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,834
A family trait.

261
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,420
Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown.

262
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:07,383
- Don't leave me alone with these people.
- I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early.

263
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:10,845
And this is the first of many courses.

264
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:13,180
I thought you might say that.

265
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:15,933
But since we're short on time...

266
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,351
Come on, girls.

267
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:25,109
See you at sundown.

268
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,320
Close the door!

269
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,501
Did you have to bury her
in a place like this?

270
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,589
She should be on a hill somewhere

271
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:49,050
with the sun and the clouds above her.

272
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:51,218
She was my sister.

273
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:53,012
This is where she belongs.

274
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:56,515
She belonged with me.

275
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,191
In my dreams,
I kill him every night.

276
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:11,030
It's done, Your Grace.
The Targaryens are gone.

277
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,160
Not all of them.

278
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:29,048
Daenerys!

279
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:33,928
Daenerys.

280
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:36,055
There's our bride-to-be.

281
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:39,642
Look, a gift from Illyrio.

282
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:42,812
Touch it.

283
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:45,147
Go on, feel the fabric.

284
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,070
Mmm.

285
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,074
Isn't he a gracious host?

286
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:02,123
We've been his guests for over a year
and he's never asked us for anything.

287
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:04,125
Illyrio's no fool.

288
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:06,043
He knows I won't forget my friends

289
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,421
when I come into my throne.

290
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,510
You still slouch.

291
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,183
Let them see.

292
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,731
You have a woman's body now.

293
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,625
I need you to be perfect today.

294
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:50,546
Can you do that for me?

295
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,677
You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?

296
00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:59,680
No.

297
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:09,398
When they write the history
of my reign, sweet sister,

298
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,484
they will say it began today.

299
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:36,884
It's too hot, my lady.

300
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,074
Where is he?

301
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,077
The Dothraki are not known
for their punctuality.

302
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:20,427
[Athchomar chomakaan, (zhey) khal vezhven]
Respect to one that is respectful, great Khal.

303
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:22,471
May I present my honored guests?

304
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:26,141
Viserys of House Targaryen,

305
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:27,768
the third of his name,

306
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:31,272
the rightful King of the Andals
and the First Men,

307
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:32,690
and his sister,

308
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:35,693
Daenerys of House Targaryen.

309
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:38,612
<i>Azha anhaan asshilat...</i>

310
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,156
Do you see how long his hair is?

311
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:44,076
When Dothraki are defeated in combat

312
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:47,788
they cut off their braid
so the whole world can see their shame.

313
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:51,750
Khal Drogo has never been defeated.

314
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:57,089
He's a savage, of course,
but he's one of the finest killers alive.

315
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,593
And you will be his queen.

316
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,262
Come forward, my dear.

317
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,511
Where is he going?

318
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:47,348
- The ceremony is over.
- But he... But he didn't say anything.

319
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:48,599
Did he like her?

320
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:52,478
Trust me, Your Grace,
if he didn't like her, we'd know.

321
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,858
It won't be long now.

322
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:01,612
Soon you will cross the narrow sea
and take back your father's throne.

323
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:06,700
The people drink secret toasts
to your health.

324
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,286
They cry out for their true king.

325
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,708
When will they be married?

326
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:18,379
Soon.
The Dothraki never stay still for long.

327
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,756
Is it true they lie with their horses?

328
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,801
I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.

329
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,053
Do you take me for a fool?

330
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:27,888
I take you for a king.

331
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:31,141
Kings lack the caution
of common men.

332
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,977
My apologies if I've given offense.

333
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:35,688
I know how to play a man like Drogo.

334
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:38,607
I give him a queen
and he gives me an army.

335
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:41,568
I don't want to be his queen.

336
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,033
I want to go home.

337
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:50,035
So do I.

338
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:53,497
I want us both to go home,

339
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:55,833
but they took it from us.

340
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,751
So tell me, sweet sister,

341
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,545
how do we go home?

342
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:03,424
I don't know.

343
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,801
We go home with an army.

344
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,180
With Khal Drogo's army.

345
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:14,393
I would let his whole tribe fuck you,

346
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,604
all 40,000 men and their horses too,

347
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:19,398
if that's what it took.

348
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,209
Do you think Joffrey will like me?

349
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,545
What if he thinks I'm ugly?

350
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:45,090
Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.

351
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:49,094
He's so handsome.

352
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:52,973
When would we be married?
Soon? Or do we have to wait?

353
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,185
Hush now.
Your father hasn't even said yes.

354
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:57,978
Why would he say no?

355
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:01,023
He'd be the second most powerful man
in the kingdoms.

356
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:03,192
He'd have to leave home.

357
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:06,862
He'd have to leave me.

358
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:09,990
And so would you.

359
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,451
You left your home to come here.

360
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,328
And I'd be queen someday.

361
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:17,831
Please make Father say yes!

362
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,750
- Sansa...
- Please, please!

363
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,753
It's the only thing I ever wanted.

364
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:38,811
Fill that up!
Boys, Rodrik, come on.

365
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,979
Come on!

366
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:43,857
Come here, you little beauty!

367
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:00,958
Is he dead yet?

368
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,506
Uncle Benjen.

369
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,718
You got bigger.

370
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:14,680
Rode all day.

371
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:17,391
Didn't want to leave you alone
with the Lannisters.

372
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:18,851
Why aren't you at the feast?

373
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:21,728
Lady Stark thought it might
insult the royal family

374
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:23,772
to seat a bastard in their midst.

375
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,984
Well, you're always
welcome on the Wall.

376
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,069
No bastard was ever
refused a seat there.

377
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,904
So take me with you
when you go back.

378
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,907
- Jon...
- Father will let me if you ask him.

379
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,826
I know he will.

380
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:40,622
The Wall isn't going anywhere.

381
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,417
I'm ready to swear your oath.

382
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:46,670
You don't understand
what you'd be giving up.

383
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:48,714
We have no families.

384
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,551
- None of us will ever father sons.
- I don't care about that.

385
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:55,637
You might, if you knew what it meant.

386
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:01,476
I'd better get inside,

387
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:03,896
rescue your father from his guests.

388
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,984
We'll talk later.

389
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,745
Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.

390
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:25,042
What are you doing back there?

391
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,377
Preparing for a night with your family.

392
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:34,509
I've always wanted to see the Wall.

393
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:36,428
You're Tyrion Lannister,

394
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,096
the queen's brother?

395
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:39,890
My greatest accomplishment.

396
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:44,102
And you, you're Ned Stark's bastard,
aren't you?

397
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,733
Did I offend you? Sorry.

398
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:54,321
You are the bastard, though.

399
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,950
Lord Eddard Stark is my father.

400
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:01,828
And Lady Stark is not your mother,

401
00:43:01,955 --> 00:43:04,957
making you... the bastard.

402
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:09,086
Let me give you some advice, bastard.

403
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:12,047
Never forget what you are.

404
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,508
The rest of the world will not.

405
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:16,218
Wear it like armor...

406
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,304
and it can never be used to hurt you.

407
00:43:20,974 --> 00:43:23,642
What the hell do you know
about being a bastard?

408
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:28,563
All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes.

409
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:51,878
You at a feast...

410
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,506
it's like a bear in a trap.

411
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:58,093
The boy I beheaded...

412
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:02,347
- did you know him?
- Of course I did. Just a lad.

413
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:05,600
But he was tough, Ned,

414
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:06,977
a true ranger.

415
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,480
He was talking madness.

416
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:13,442
Said the walkers slaughtered his friends.

417
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:15,861
The two he was with are still missing.

418
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:20,991
Hmph. A wildling ambush.

419
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:23,076
Maybe.

420
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,913
Direwolves south of the Wall,

421
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,249
talk of the walkers,

422
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,918
and my brother might be
the next Hand of the King.

423
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:38,383
Winter is coming.

424
00:44:40,053 --> 00:44:42,888
- Uncle Benjen.
- Robb boy.

425
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:44,473
- How are you?
- I'm good.

426
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,687
Is this your first time
in the North, Your Grace?

427
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:53,565
Yes. Lovely country.

428
00:44:57,362 --> 00:45:00,697
I'm sure it's very grim
after King's Landing.

429
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:06,370
I remember how scared I was when
Ned brought me up here for the first time.

430
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:10,165
Hello, little dove.

431
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:13,335
But you are a beauty.

432
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:15,754
- How old are you?
- Thirteen, Your Grace.

433
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,465
You're tall. Still growing?

434
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:20,425
I think so, Your Grace.

435
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,677
And have you bled yet?

436
00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:29,267
No, Your Grace.

437
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:32,396
Your dress, did you make it?

438
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:37,442
Such talent.
You must make something for me.

439
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:42,406
I hear we might share
a grandchild someday.

440
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,616
I hear the same.

441
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,952
Your daughter will do well in the capital.

442
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:50,414
Such a beauty shouldn't stay
hidden up here forever.

443
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:10,058
- Your pardon.
- I hear we might be neighbors soon.

444
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:13,645
- I hope it's true.
- Yes, the king has honored me with his offer.

445
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,982
I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate
your new title, if you accept.

446
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,192
It would be good
to have you on the field.

447
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,695
The competition has become a bit stale.

448
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:24,072
- I don't fight in tournaments.
- No?

449
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,740
Getting a little old for it?

450
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:29,744
I don't fight in tournaments

451
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:32,247
because when I fight a man for real,

452
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:34,124
I don't want him to know what I can do.

453
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:37,794
Well said.

454
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:40,505
Arya!

455
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:44,551
It's not funny!

456
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:47,304
She always does this.

457
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,848
This was my favorite dress
and she ruined it.

458
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:52,434
She always does it
and it's not funny!

459
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,394
Time for bed.

460
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,157
I'm a Northman.

461
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:13,371
I belong here with you, not down south
in that rats' nest they call a capital.

462
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:17,167
I won't let him take you.

463
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:21,296
The king takes what he wants.

464
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:23,715
That's why he's king.

465
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:28,428
I'll say, "Listen, fat man."

466
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:32,849
"You are not taking
my husband anywhere.

467
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,893
"He belongs to me now."

468
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:40,690
How did he get so fat?

469
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:45,111
He only stops eating
when it's time for a drink.

470
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:49,157
It's Maester Luwin, my lord.

471
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:52,536
Send him in.

472
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,165
Pardon, my lord, my lady.

473
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,793
A rider in the night...

474
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:02,087
from your sister.

475
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:12,430
- Stay.
- This was sent from the Eyrie.

476
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,689
What's she doing at the Eyrie?

477
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:23,358
She hasn't been back there
since her wedding.

478
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:33,702
What news?

479
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,789
She's fled the capital.

480
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:42,669
She says Jon Arryn was murdered.

481
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:44,671
By the Lannisters.

482
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:47,465
She says the king is in danger.

483
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:49,843
She's fresh widowed, Cat.

484
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:51,595
She doesn't know what she's saying.

485
00:48:51,721 --> 00:48:57,017
Lysa's head would be on a spike right now
if the wrong people had found that letter.

486
00:48:57,143 --> 00:48:59,311
Do you think she would risk her life,

487
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:01,021
her son's life,

488
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:04,524
if she wasn't certain
her husband was murdered?

489
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:13,617
If this news is true...

490
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:17,287
and the Lannisters conspire
against the throne,

491
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:19,831
who but you can protect the king?

492
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,208
They murdered the last Hand.

493
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:24,544
Now you want Ned to take the job?

494
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:28,548
The king rode for a month
to ask for Lord Stark's help.

495
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,176
He's the only one he trusts.

496
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:35,513
You swore the king an oath, my lord.

497
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,225
He's spent half his life
fighting Robert's wars.

498
00:49:39,352 --> 00:49:41,353
He owes him nothing.

499
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:46,483
Your father and brother
rode south once

500
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:49,235
on a king's demand.

501
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:53,281
A different time.

502
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:56,743
A different king.

503
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:01,433
When do I meet with the khal?
We need to begin planning the invasion.

504
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:04,978
If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown,
you shall have it.

505
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:08,148
- When?
- When their omens favor war.

506
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:11,818
I piss on Dothraki omens.

507
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:14,612
I've waited 17 years to get my throne back.

508
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:54,360
Iteo akkah.

509
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:19,511
A Dothraki wedding without at least
three deaths is considered a dull affair.

510
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:37,152
- [Jadi, zhey Jora Andahli] Come, Jorah the Andal.
- [Khal vezhven] Great khal.

511
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:44,911
A small gift, for the new khaleesi.

512
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:48,456
Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.

513
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,543
Thank you, ser.

514
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:55,922
Are you from my country?

515
00:52:56,048 --> 00:52:58,091
Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.

516
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:00,927
I served your father for many years.

517
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:04,013
Gods be good, I hope to
always serve the rightful king.

518
00:53:27,246 --> 00:53:29,914
Dragon's eggs, Daenerys,

519
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,792
from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai.

520
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,837
The ages have turned them to stone,

521
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:37,922
but they will always be beautiful.

522
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,843
Thank you, Magister.

523
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,580
She's beautiful.

524
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,086
Ser Jorah, I...

525
00:54:58,212 --> 00:55:00,964
I don't know how to say "thank you"
in Dothraki.

526
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:03,883
There is no word for "thank you"
in Dothraki.

527
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:27,031
Make him happy.

528
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:28,426
No.

529
00:56:31,764 --> 00:56:33,598
Do you know the common tongue?

530
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:40,146
No.

531
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,611
Is "no" the only word that you know?

532
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,447
No.

533
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:19,852
Rough night, Imp?

534
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,938
If I get through this without squirting

535
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:24,941
from one end or the other,
it'll be a miracle.

536
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:26,859
I didn't pick you for a hunter.

537
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:30,071
The greatest in the land -
my spear never misses.

538
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,116
It's not hunting if you pay for it.

539
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,210
Are you as good with a spear
as you used to be?

540
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:46,796
No, but I'm still better than you.

541
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,425
I know what I'm putting you through.

542
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:53,219
Thank you for saying yes.

543
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:57,640
I only ask you because I need you.

544
00:57:58,851 --> 00:58:01,394
You're a loyal friend. You hear me?

545
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,063
A loyal friend.

546
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:05,857
The last one I've got.

547
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,777
- I hope I'll serve you well.
- You will.

548
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:14,282
And I'll make sure you don't look
so fucking grim all the time.

549
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,869
Come on, boys,
let's go kill some boar!

550
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:29,589
Come on, you.

551
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:48,751
Stop! Stop.

552
00:59:53,632 --> 00:59:55,883
Are you completely mad?

553
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:58,511
- He saw us.
- It's all right, it's all right.

554
00:59:58,637 --> 01:00:00,680
- It's all right.
- He saw us!

555
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:02,932
I heard you the first time.

556
01:00:07,688 --> 01:00:09,355
Quite the little climber, aren't you?

557
01:00:10,649 --> 01:00:13,442
- How old are you, boy?
- Ten.

558
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:15,152
Ten.

559
01:00:23,996 --> 01:00:26,330
The things I do for love.

560
01:00:27,996 --> 01:00:32,330
OMG, DID THE KID DIE!??!?! Sync, corrected &

3
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,342
You need to drink, child.

4
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,723
And eat.

5
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,771
Isn't there anything else?

6
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,943
The Dothraki have two things
in abundance - grass and horses.

7
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,278
People can't live on grass.

8
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,915
In the Shadow Lands
beyond Asshai,

9
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,376
they say there are fields of ghost grass

10
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,712
with stalks as pale as milk
that glow in the night.

11
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:53,257
It murders all other grass.

12
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,801
The Dothraki believe that one day

13
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,012
it will cover everything -
that's the way the world will end.

14
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,862
It'll get easier.

15
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:53,609
Khaleesi!

16
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,569
Your hands.

17
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,124
We're still not far from Pentos,
Your Grace.

18
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,627
Master Illyrio has
extended his hospitality.

19
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,420
You'd be more comfortable there.

20
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:16,298
I have no interest
in hospitality or comfort.

21
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:20,677
I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end
of the bargain and I have my crown.

22
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,055
As you wish, Your Grace.

23
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:26,433
Well, Mormont,
as brutish as this life is,

24
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:28,727
I suppose it is preferable to beheading.

25
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:32,397
What did Ned Stark want you for?

26
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,651
Buying from a slaver?

27
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,736
Selling to one.

28
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,780
Some poachers I caught on my land.

29
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:45,285
Under my reign, you won't be punished
for such nonsense.

30
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,246
You can rest assured of that.

31
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,523
Better-looking bitches
than you're used to, Uncle.

32
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,363
My mother's been looking for you.

33
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,615
We ride for King's Landing today.

34
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,743
Before you go, you will call
on Lord and Lady Stark

35
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:29,162
and offer your sympathies.

36
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,707
What good will my sympathies do them?

37
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,420
None. But it is expected of you.

38
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,463
Your absence has already been noted.

39
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,549
The boy means nothing to me.

40
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,010
And I can't stand
the wailing of women.

41
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:47,139
One word and I'll hit you again.

42
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,849
I'm telling Mother!

43
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,311
Go! Tell her.

44
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,521
But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark

45
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,565
and you will fall on your knees
in front of them

46
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,484
and tell them how very sorry you are,
that you are at their service,

47
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:02,821
and that all your prayers are with them.
Do you understand?

48
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:05,115
You can't...

49
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,700
Do you understand?

50
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,751
The Prince will
remember that, little lord.

51
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,794
I hope so.

52
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:21,215
If he forgets, be a good dog
and remind him.

53
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,137
Ah. Time for breakfast.

54
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:37,314
Bread. And two of those little fish.

55
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,734
And a mug of dark beer
to wash it down.

56
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,405
And bacon, burnt black.

57
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:47,407
Hyah.

58
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:50,369
- Little brother.
- Beloved siblings.

59
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,750
Is Bran going to die?

60
00:06:58,627 --> 00:06:59,753
Apparently not.

61
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:06,468
- What do you mean?
- The maester says the boy may live.

62
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,646
It's no mercy, letting a child
linger in such pain.

63
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,481
Only the gods know for certain.

64
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,025
All the rest of us can do is pray.

65
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,071
The charms of the North
seem entirely lost on you.

66
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,865
I still can't believe you're going.

67
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,033
It's ridiculous, even for you.

68
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,869
Where's your sense of wonder?

69
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:36,081
The greatest structure ever built,
the intrepid men of the Night's Watch,

70
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,417
the wintry abode of the white walkers.

71
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,670
Tell me you're not thinking
of taking the black.

72
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:44,673
And go celibate?
The whores would go begging

73
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,675
from Dorne to Casterly Rock.

74
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,886
No, I just want to stand
on top of the Wall

75
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:50,804
and piss off the edge of the world.

76
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,892
The children don't need to hear your filth.

77
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,520
Come.

78
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:08,363
Even if the boy lives,
he'll be a cripple, a grotesque.

79
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,949
Give me a good, clean death any day.

80
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:15,829
Speaking for the grotesques,
I'd have to disagree.

81
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:18,665
Death is so final, whereas life...

82
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,001
ah, life is full of possibilities.

83
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:26,590
I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very
interested to hear what he has to say.

84
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:31,011
My dear brother,

85
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,805
there are times you make me wonder
whose side you're on.

86
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:36,058
My dear brother, you wound me.

87
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,602
You know how much
I love my family.

88
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,206
Please.

89
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:02,584
Oh, I would have dressed, Your Grace.

90
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,045
This is your home. I'm your guest.

91
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,425
Handsome one, isn't he?

92
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:15,639
I lost my first boy,
a little black-haired beauty.

93
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,599
He was a fighter too -

94
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,810
tried to beat the fever that took him.

95
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,981
Forgive me.

96
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:25,946
It's the last thing you
need to hear right now.

97
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,110
I never knew.

98
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,112
It was years ago.

99
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:35,075
Robert was crazed,
beat his hands bloody on the wall,

100
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,579
all the things men do
to show you how much they care.

101
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,586
The boy looked just like him.

102
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,089
Such a little thing.

103
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,301
A bird without feathers.

104
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:57,472
They came to take his body away

105
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:02,186
and Robert held me.
I screamed and I battled, but he held me.

106
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,276
That little bundle.

107
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,488
They took him away
and I never saw him again.

108
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,866
Never have visited the crypt, never.

109
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,587
I pray to the Mother
every morning and night

110
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,797
that she return your child to you.

111
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,635
I am grateful.

112
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:37,596
Perhaps this time she'll listen.

113
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,733
A sword for the Wall?

114
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,904
- I already have one.
- Good man.

115
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:38,740
- Have you swung it yet?
- Of course I have.

116
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:40,367
At someone, I mean.

117
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:48,500
It's a strange thing,
the first time you cut a man.

118
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,795
You realise we're nothing
but sacks of meat and blood,

119
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,715
and some bone to keep it all standing.

120
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,052
Let me thank you ahead of time

121
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:01,930
for guarding us all from the perils
beyond the Wall -

122
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,600
wildlings and white walkers
and whatnot.

123
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:10,814
We're grateful to have good, strong men
like you protecting us.

124
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:16,028
We've guarded the Kingdoms
for 8,000 years.

125
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:21,283
Is it "we" already?

126
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,244
Have you taken your vows, then?

127
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,787
Soon enough.

128
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:30,459
Give my regards to the Night's Watch.

129
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:34,630
I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve
in such an elite force. And if not...

130
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,050
it's only for life.

131
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,488
Thank you, Nymeria.

132
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,206
Septa Mordane says
I have to do it again.

133
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:12,042
My things weren't
properly folded, she says.

134
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:15,128
Who cares how they're folded?
They're going to get all messed up anyway.

135
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:17,422
It's good you've got help.

136
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:19,132
Watch.

137
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,176
Nymeria, gloves.

138
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:29,601
- Impressive.
- Shut up.

139
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:31,687
Nymeria, gloves!

140
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:35,858
I have something for you.

141
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,277
And it has to be packed very carefully.

142
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:39,987
A present?

143
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,072
Close the door.

144
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:57,004
This is no toy.

145
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:02,467
Be careful you don't cut yourself.

146
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,431
- It's so skinny.
- So are you.

147
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,601
I had the blacksmith
make it for you special.

148
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:11,977
It won't hack a man's head off,

149
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,052
but it can poke him full of holes
if you're quick enough.

150
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,773
- I can be quick.
- You'll have to work at it every day.

151
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,693
How does it feel?

152
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:22,905
Do you like the balance?

153
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:24,489
I think so.

154
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:28,368
First lesson - stick them with the pointy end.

155
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:30,370
I know which end to use.

156
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,961
I'm going to miss you.

157
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:40,923
Careful.

158
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:55,103
All the best swords have names, you know.

159
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,359
Sansa can keep her sewing needles.

160
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,071
I've got a needle of my own.

161
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:20,921
I came to say goodbye to Bran.

162
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,631
You've said it.

163
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:36,353
I wish I could be here when you wake up.

164
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,192
I'm going north with Uncle Benjen.

165
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,652
I'm taking the black.

166
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:55,414
I know we always talked about
seeing the Wall together,

167
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:59,209
but you'll be able to come visit me
at Castle Black when you're better.

168
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,797
I'll know my way around by then.

169
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,258
I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch.

170
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,349
We can go out walking beyond the Wall,
if you're not afraid.

171
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,909
I want you...

172
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:33,702
to leave.

173
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:34,972
1T years ago

174
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:37,516
you rode off with Robert Baratheon.

175
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:43,063
You came back a year later
with another woman's son.

176
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,317
And now you're leaving again.

177
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,697
I have no choice.

178
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:55,742
That's what men always say
when honour calls.

179
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:59,204
That's what you tell your families,
tell yourselves.

180
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,166
You do have a choice.

181
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:05,878
And you've made it.

182
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:11,967
Cat...

183
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:19,516
I can't do it, Ned.

184
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:24,438
I really can't.

185
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,023
You can.

186
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:29,735
You must.

187
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:56,053
You've said goodbye to Bran?

188
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:58,180
He's not going to die. I know it.

189
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:00,474
You Starks are hard to kill.

190
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:03,018
My mother?

191
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,687
- She was very kind.
- Good.

192
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:09,650
Next time I see you,
you'll be all in black.

193
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,902
It was always my colour.

194
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:14,863
Farewell, Snow.

195
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,615
And you, Stark.

196
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,170
There's great honour serving
in the Night's Watch.

197
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:16,800
The Starks have manned the Wall
for thousands of years.

198
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:19,720
And you are a Stark.

199
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:21,930
You might not have my name,

200
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,057
but you have my blood.

201
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,691
Is my mother alive?

202
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,987
Does she know about me?
Where I am, where I'm going?

203
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,698
Does she care?

204
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,994
I
The next time we see each other

205
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,121
we'll talk about your mother.

206
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:48,040
Hmm?

207
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:49,625
I promise.

208
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:32,209
Gods, this is country!

209
00:21:34,253 --> 00:21:37,464
I've half a mind to leave them
all behind and keep going.

210
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:41,969
I've half a mind to go with you.

211
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:46,765
What do you say, just you and me
on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides,

212
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:50,227
a couple of tavern wenches
to warm our beds tonight.

213
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:53,021
You should have asked me 20 years ago.

214
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:55,899
There were wars to fight,
women to marry -

215
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:58,277
we never had the chance to be young.

216
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:00,028
I recall a few chances.

217
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:06,535
There was that one...
Oh, what was her name?

218
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:08,579
That common girl of yours?

219
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:11,498
Becca. With the great big tits
you could bury your face in.

220
00:22:11,582 --> 00:22:13,792
Bessie.
She was one of yours.

221
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:17,588
Bessie!
Thank the gods for Bessie.

222
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:19,339
And her tits.

223
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:22,801
Yours was, er... Aleena?

224
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:25,804
No. You told me once. Er... Meryl?

225
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:27,848
Your bastard's mother?

226
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:31,852
- Wylla.
- That's it.

227
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:34,021
She must have been a rare wench

228
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:37,065
to make Lord Eddard Stark
forget his honour.

229
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:39,234
You never told me what she looked like.

230
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:41,528
Nor will I.

231
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:46,033
We were at war.

232
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:48,911
None of us knew if we were
gonna go back home again.

233
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:52,080
You're too hard on yourself.
You always have been.

234
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:57,252
I swear if I weren't your king,
you'd have hit me already.

235
00:22:57,377 --> 00:23:00,714
The worst thing about your coronation -

236
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,841
I'll never get to hit you again.

237
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:07,638
Trust me, that's not the worst thing.

238
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:13,644
There was a rider in the night.

239
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:23,237
Daenerys Targaryen has wed
some Dothraki horselord.

240
00:23:23,362 --> 00:23:25,197
What of it? Do we send her
a wedding gift?

241
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,616
A knife perhaps, a good, sharp one,

242
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:29,743
and a bold man to wield it.

243
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,662
She's little more than a child.

244
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:34,998
Soon enough that child will spread her legs
and start breeding.

245
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:38,794
- Tell me we're not speaking of this.
- Oh, it's unspeakable to you?

246
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:42,214
What her father did to your family -
that was unspeakable.

247
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:44,633
What Rhaegar Targaryen
did to your sister,

248
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:46,760
the woman I loved.

249
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:49,930
I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.

250
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,974
But you can't get your hands
on this one, can you?

251
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,726
This Khal Drogo,

252
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,728
it's said he has 100,000 men
in his horde.

253
00:23:56,854 --> 00:23:59,606
Even a million Dothraki
are no threat to the realm,

254
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,317
as long as they remain on the other side
of the Narrow Sea.

255
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:04,403
They have no ships, Robert.

256
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:07,489
There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms
who call me usurper.

257
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:12,327
If the Targaryen boy crosses
with a Dothraki horde at his back,

258
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:15,080
- the scum will join him.
- He will not cross.

259
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:19,960
And if by chance he does,
we'll throw him back into the sea.

260
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:27,050
There's a war coming, Ned.

261
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:31,305
I don't know when,
I don't know who we'll be fighting,

262
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,890
but it's coming.

263
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:46,713
Sit.

264
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,590
You'll be fed.

265
00:25:52,678 --> 00:25:54,346
Untie them.

266
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:57,724
Ah, rapers.

267
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:03,689
They were given a choice, no doubt -
castration or the Wall.

268
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:06,066
Most choose the knife.

269
00:26:11,113 --> 00:26:13,615
Not impressed by your new brothers?

270
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:18,328
Lovely thing about the Watch -

271
00:26:18,412 --> 00:26:21,790
you discard your old family
and get a whole new one.

272
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:32,676
Why do you read so much?

273
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:35,929
Look at me and tell me what you see.

274
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:39,141
Is this a trick?

275
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:42,978
What you see is a dwarf.

276
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:46,273
If I'd been born a peasant they might've
left me out in the woods to die.

277
00:26:46,315 --> 00:26:50,485
Alas, I was born a Lannister
of Casterly Rock.

278
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:52,613
Things are expected of me.

279
00:26:52,738 --> 00:26:55,157
My father was the Hand of the King
for 20 years.

280
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,284
Until your brother killed that king.

281
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:06,835
Yes, until my brother killed him.

282
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:11,381
Life is full of these little ironies.

283
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:15,177
My sister married the new king, and...

284
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,763
my repulsive nephew
will be king after him.

285
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:23,602
I must do my part for the honour of my house.
Wouldn't you agree?

286
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:27,314
But how?

287
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:30,234
Well, my brother has his sword

288
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:31,610
and I have my mind,

289
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:35,781
and a mind needs books
like a sword needs a whetstone.

290
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:38,534
That's why I read so much, Jon Snow.

291
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:44,456
And you?

292
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:46,750
What's your story, bastard?

293
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:51,922
Ask me nicely
and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.

294
00:27:55,968 --> 00:27:58,720
A bastard boy with nothing to inherit,

295
00:27:58,846 --> 00:28:03,308
off to join the ancient order
of the Night's Watch,

296
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:07,229
alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.

297
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:09,074
The Night's Watch protects
the realm from...

298
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:12,401
Ah, yes, yes, against
grumpkins and snarks

299
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:16,071
and all the other monsters
your wet nurse warned you about.

300
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,448
You're a smart boy.

301
00:28:18,574 --> 00:28:21,034
You don't believe that nonsense.

302
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:31,461
Everything's better
with some wine in the belly.

303
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:10,083
It's time we reviewed
the accounts, my lady.

304
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:14,004
You'll want to know how much
this royal visit has cost us.

305
00:29:15,464 --> 00:29:17,508
Talk to Poole about it.

306
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,721
Poole went south
with Lord Stark, my lady.

307
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:25,390
We need a new steward,

308
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:28,560
and there are several other
appointments that require

309
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:32,564
- our immediate attention.
- I don't care about appointments!

310
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:35,817
I'll make the appointments.

311
00:29:38,654 --> 00:29:40,572
We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.

312
00:29:40,656 --> 00:29:42,699
Very good, my lord.

313
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:46,453
My lady.

314
00:29:59,591 --> 00:30:01,760
When was the last time you left this room?

315
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:04,388
I have to take care of him.

316
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:06,223
He's not going to die, Mother.

317
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:08,257
Maester Luwin says the most
dangerous time has passed.

318
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:09,309
What if he's wrong?

319
00:30:09,393 --> 00:30:12,813
- Bran needs me.
- Rickon needs you.

320
00:30:13,772 --> 00:30:15,649
He's six.

321
00:30:15,774 --> 00:30:18,986
He doesn't know what's happening.
He follows me around all day,

322
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:21,446
- clutching my leg, crying...
- Close the windows!

323
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:23,574
I can't stand it!
Please make them stop!

324
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:28,912
Fire.

325
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:32,207
You stay here. I'll come back.

326
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:52,436
You're not supposed to be here.

327
00:30:52,561 --> 00:30:55,147
No one is supposed to be here.

328
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:57,566
It's a mercy.

329
00:30:57,649 --> 00:30:59,526
He's dead already.

330
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:02,988
No!

331
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:13,809
- Have you ever seen a dragon?
- Dragon gone, Khaleesi.

332
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:16,812
Everywhere? Even in the East?

333
00:32:16,854 --> 00:32:19,898
No dragon. Brave men kill them.

334
00:32:20,524 --> 00:32:22,943
- It is known.
- It is known.

335
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:26,947
A trader from Qarth told me
that dragons come from the moon.

336
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,199
The moon?

337
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:31,952
He told me the moon
was an egg, Khaleesi,

338
00:32:32,035 --> 00:32:34,663
that once there were two moons in the sky.

339
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:38,709
But one wandered too close to the sun
and it cracked from the heat,

340
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:41,795
and out of it poured
a thousand thousand dragons

341
00:32:41,837 --> 00:32:43,755
and they drank the sun's fire.

342
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:46,842
Moon is no egg.

343
00:32:46,884 --> 00:32:49,720
Moon is goddess - wife of sun.

344
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:52,347
- It is known.
- It is known.

345
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:55,809
Leave me with her.

346
00:33:04,026 --> 00:33:07,696
Why did the trader from Qarth
tell you these stories?

347
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:10,324
Men like to talk when they're happy.

348
00:33:10,449 --> 00:33:14,494
Before your brother bought me for you,
it was my job to make men happy.

349
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,872
How old were you?

350
00:33:16,955 --> 00:33:19,499
I was nine when my mother
sold me to the pleasure house.

351
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:21,210
Nine?!

352
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:25,255
I did not touch a man
for three years, Khaleesi.

353
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,217
First you must learn.

354
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:34,556
Can you teach me
how to make the khal happy?

355
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:37,768
Yes.

356
00:33:37,893 --> 00:33:39,603
Will it take three years?

357
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:42,731
No.

358
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:05,879
Welcome.

359
00:35:36,887 --> 00:35:40,307
What I am about to tell you
must remain between us.

360
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,394
I don't think Bran fell from that tower.

361
00:35:46,104 --> 00:35:47,606
I think he was thrown.

362
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:51,735
The boy was always
surefooted before.

363
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:54,696
Someone tried to kill him twice.

364
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,658
Why? Why murder an innocent child?

365
00:35:57,783 --> 00:36:00,452
Unless he saw something
he wasn't meant to see.

366
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:03,205
- Saw what, my lady?
- I don't know.

367
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:07,084
But I would stake my life
the Lannisters are involved.

368
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:10,462
We already have reason to suspect
their loyalty to the Crown.

369
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:12,798
Did you notice the dagger the killer used?

370
00:36:12,923 --> 00:36:15,217
It's too fine a weapon for such a man.

371
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,595
The blade is Valyrian steel,
the handle dragonbone.

372
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,514
Someone gave it to him.

373
00:36:21,807 --> 00:36:25,561
They come into our home
and try to murder my brother?

374
00:36:25,644 --> 00:36:27,187
If it's war they want...

375
00:36:27,229 --> 00:36:29,439
if it comes to that,
you know I'll stand behind you.

376
00:36:29,565 --> 00:36:32,693
What, is there going to be
a battle in the Godswood?

377
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:34,319
Hmm?

378
00:36:34,403 --> 00:36:37,406
Too easily words of war
become acts of war.

379
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:39,533
We don't know the truth yet.

380
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:41,994
Lord Stark must be told of this.

381
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,913
I don't trust a raven
to carry these words.

382
00:36:44,997 --> 00:36:46,915
- I'll ride to King's Landing.
- No.

383
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:50,210
There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.

384
00:36:50,335 --> 00:36:52,171
- I will go myself.
- Mother, you can't.

385
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:53,797
I must.

386
00:36:54,882 --> 00:36:57,467
I'll send Hal with a squad
of guardsmen to escort you.

387
00:36:57,634 --> 00:37:00,095
Too large a party attracts unwanted attention.

388
00:37:00,262 --> 00:37:02,347
I don't want the Lannisters
to know I'm coming.

389
00:37:02,472 --> 00:37:03,974
Let me accompany you at least.

390
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:07,102
The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place
for a woman alone.

391
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:13,275
What about Bran?

392
00:37:14,943 --> 00:37:17,821
I have prayed to the Seven
for more than a month.

393
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:22,409
Bran's life is in their hands now.

394
00:38:21,426 --> 00:38:23,262
No, Khaleesi.

395
00:38:23,387 --> 00:38:26,223
You must look in his eyes always.

396
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:28,433
Love comes in at the eyes.

397
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:32,855
It is said that Irogenia of Lys
could finish a man

398
00:38:32,938 --> 00:38:34,815
with nothing but her eyes.

399
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:37,109
Finish a man?

400
00:38:38,735 --> 00:38:40,904
Oh.

401
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:45,617
Kings travelled across the world
for a night with Irogenia.

402
00:38:45,742 --> 00:38:48,370
Magisters sold their palaces.

403
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:51,915
Khals burned her enemies
just to have her for a few hours.

404
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:55,586
They say a thousand men
proposed to her

405
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:58,755
and she refused them all.

406
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,092
Well, she sounds like
an interesting woman.

407
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:03,886
I... I don't think

408
00:39:04,011 --> 00:39:06,471
that Drogo will like it with me on top.

409
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:08,849
You will make him like it, Khaleesi.

410
00:39:08,974 --> 00:39:10,976
Men want what they've never had.

411
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:14,479
And the Dothraki take slaves like
a hound takes a bitch.

412
00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:17,858
Are you a slave, Khaleesi?

413
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:31,330
Then don't make love like a slave.

414
00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:42,341
Very good, Khaleesi.

415
00:39:42,466 --> 00:39:44,468
Out there he is the mighty khal,

416
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:48,472
but in this tent, he belongs to you.

417
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:50,682
I... I don't think

418
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:53,310
that this is the Dothraki way.

419
00:39:53,435 --> 00:39:55,479
If he wanted the Dothraki way,

420
00:39:56,271 --> 00:39:58,398
why did he marry you?

421
00:40:46,864 --> 00:40:48,240
No.

422
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:53,662
No!

423
00:40:55,664 --> 00:40:58,864
[Ajjalan anha zalat vitiherat yer hatif]
Tonight I would look upon your face.

424
00:42:45,649 --> 00:42:47,109
Pardon me, ser.

425
00:42:50,904 --> 00:42:53,240
Do I frighten you so much, girl?

426
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:57,786
Or is it him there making you shake?

427
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,330
He frightens me too.

428
00:43:00,497 --> 00:43:02,958
Look at that face.

429
00:43:03,834 --> 00:43:05,669
I'm sorry if I offended you, ser.

430
00:43:12,509 --> 00:43:13,509
Why won't he speak to me?

431
00:43:13,594 --> 00:43:16,513
He hasn't been very talkative
these last 20 years.

432
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,641
Since the Mad King had his tongue
ripped out with hot pincers.

433
00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:22,519
He speaks damn well
with his sword though.

434
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:26,064
Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's Justice.

435
00:43:27,733 --> 00:43:29,735
The Royal Executioner.

436
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:34,198
What is it, sweet lady?

437
00:43:35,824 --> 00:43:38,076
Does the hound frighten you?

438
00:43:38,243 --> 00:43:39,703
Away with you, dog.

439
00:43:40,495 --> 00:43:42,247
You're scaring my lady.

440
00:43:44,541 --> 00:43:46,585
I don't like to see you upset.

441
00:43:49,171 --> 00:43:50,923
The sun's finally shining.

442
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:53,675
Come walk with me.

443
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:56,803
Stay, Lady.

444
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:15,697
I probably shouldn't have any more.

445
00:44:15,781 --> 00:44:18,033
Father only lets us
have one cup at feasts.

446
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,161
My princess can drink
as much as she wants.

447
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:36,385
Don't worry. You're safe with me.

448
00:44:37,427 --> 00:44:39,388
I'll get you!

449
00:44:44,726 --> 00:44:46,395
Arya!

450
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,688
Ow!

451
00:44:47,771 --> 00:44:49,481
What are you doing here?

452
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:51,608
- Go away.
- Your sister?

453
00:44:55,445 --> 00:44:58,282
- And who are you, boy?
- Mycah, my lord.

454
00:44:58,448 --> 00:45:00,450
- He's the butcher's boy.
- He's my friend.

455
00:45:00,576 --> 00:45:03,912
A butcher's boy who wants
to be a knight, eh?

456
00:45:05,706 --> 00:45:08,292
Pick up your sword, butcher's boy.
Let's see how good you are.

457
00:45:08,417 --> 00:45:11,003
She asked me to, my lord.
She asked me to.

458
00:45:11,044 --> 00:45:14,756
I'm your prince, not your lord,

459
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:18,635
and I said pick up your sword.

460
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,971
It's not a sword, my prince.
It's only a stick.

461
00:45:21,054 --> 00:45:22,931
And you're not a knight.

462
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:26,518
Only a butcher's boy.

463
00:45:26,643 --> 00:45:29,563
That was my lady's sister you were hitting.
Do you know that?

464
00:45:29,688 --> 00:45:31,940
- Stop it!
- Arya, stay out of this.

465
00:45:32,566 --> 00:45:35,152
I won't hurt him...

466
00:45:35,194 --> 00:45:36,236
much.

467
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:45,996
Arya!

468
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,373
Filthy little bitch!

469
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,334
No, no, stop it, stop it, both of you!

470
00:45:50,459 --> 00:45:53,170
You're spoiling it.
You're spoiling everything!

471
00:45:53,837 --> 00:45:56,298
I'll gut you, you little cunt!

472
00:45:59,134 --> 00:46:01,220
- Arya!
- Nymeria!

473
00:46:01,303 --> 00:46:02,221
Arya!

474
00:46:02,304 --> 00:46:03,847
Nymeria!

475
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:10,687
No.

476
00:46:10,812 --> 00:46:13,232
No. Please don't.

477
00:46:13,357 --> 00:46:15,692
Arya, leave him alone.

478
00:46:34,378 --> 00:46:37,798
My prince, my poor prince,
look what they did to you.

479
00:46:37,923 --> 00:46:40,259
Stay here. I'll go back to the inn
and bring help.

480
00:46:40,342 --> 00:46:41,552
Then go!

481
00:46:43,428 --> 00:46:45,722
Don't touch me.

482
00:46:47,891 --> 00:46:50,811
The wolfs not here.
Look down by the stream.

483
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:00,779
You've got to go. They'll kill you
for what you did to Joffrey.

484
00:47:00,904 --> 00:47:02,990
Go on. Run.

485
00:47:06,201 --> 00:47:08,245
Go! Leave now!

486
00:47:10,581 --> 00:47:12,791
- It's a direwolf.
- I'll check down here.

487
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:21,967
I think I heard a noise.

488
00:47:23,302 --> 00:47:25,137
Go!

489
00:47:37,357 --> 00:47:39,943
Arya!

490
00:47:40,944 --> 00:47:42,279
Arya!

491
00:47:43,906 --> 00:47:44,948
Arya!

492
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:47,951
Arya!

493
00:47:49,161 --> 00:47:50,621
Arya!

494
00:47:51,288 --> 00:47:52,956
Arya!

495
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:55,167
My lord!

496
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,336
My Lord! They've found her.

497
00:47:57,377 --> 00:47:59,963
- She's unharmed.
- Arya!

498
00:48:00,047 --> 00:48:02,407
- Where is she?
- She's been taken directly before the king.

499
00:48:02,508 --> 00:48:04,343
- Who took her?
- The Lannisters found her.

500
00:48:04,426 --> 00:48:06,553
- Arya!
- Right, get back.

501
00:48:06,678 --> 00:48:09,348
The queen ordered them
to bring her straight to him.

502
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:11,683
Back! Back to the inn!

503
00:48:12,643 --> 00:48:14,436
All back!

504
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,112
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

505
00:48:24,238 --> 00:48:25,739
- Are you hurt?
- No.

506
00:48:25,864 --> 00:48:28,325
Oh, it's all right.

507
00:48:30,118 --> 00:48:32,788
What is the meaning of this?

508
00:48:32,913 --> 00:48:34,957
Why was my daughter
not brought to me at once?

509
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,880
How dare you speak to your king
in that manner?

510
00:48:36,959 --> 00:48:38,377
Quiet, woman.

511
00:48:39,586 --> 00:48:42,631
Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl.

512
00:48:42,714 --> 00:48:45,092
But we need to get
this business done quickly.

513
00:48:45,801 --> 00:48:48,846
Your girl and that butcher's boy
attacked my son.

514
00:48:48,971 --> 00:48:51,139
That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.

515
00:48:51,223 --> 00:48:53,141
That's not true!

516
00:48:53,225 --> 00:48:55,811
She just... bit him a little.

517
00:48:56,645 --> 00:48:59,314
- He was hurting Mycah.
- Joff told us what happened.

518
00:48:59,398 --> 00:49:02,609
You and that boy beat him with clubs
while you set your wolf on him.

519
00:49:02,734 --> 00:49:04,278
That's not what happened!

520
00:49:04,403 --> 00:49:07,531
Yes, it is! They all attacked me
and she threw my sword in the river.

521
00:49:07,656 --> 00:49:08,824
- Liar!
- Shut up!

522
00:49:08,907 --> 00:49:10,367
Enough!

523
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:13,412
He tells me one thing,
she tells me another.

524
00:49:13,453 --> 00:49:15,747
Seven hells!
What am I to make of this?

525
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,711
- Where's your other daughter, Ned?
- In bed, asleep.

526
00:49:20,794 --> 00:49:22,838
She's not.

527
00:49:22,921 --> 00:49:25,382
Sansa, come here, darling.

528
00:49:36,393 --> 00:49:38,228
Now, child...

529
00:49:39,229 --> 00:49:41,190
tell me what happened.

530
00:49:41,273 --> 00:49:43,358
Tell it all and tell it true.

531
00:49:43,483 --> 00:49:45,944
It's a great crime to lie to a king.

532
00:49:54,494 --> 00:49:56,622
I don't know.

533
00:49:56,747 --> 00:49:59,750
I don't remember.
Everything happened so fast.

534
00:50:00,834 --> 00:50:03,212
- I didn't see.
- Liar!

535
00:50:03,337 --> 00:50:04,755
- Liar, liar, liar!
- Arya!

536
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,161
- Hey, stop it! That's enough of that.
- Liar, liar, liar!

537
00:50:07,257 --> 00:50:10,719
- Stop! Arya!
- She's as wild as that animal of hers.

538
00:50:10,802 --> 00:50:12,846
- I want her punished.
- What would you have me do,

539
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:14,431
whip her through the streets?

540
00:50:14,515 --> 00:50:17,601
Damn it, children fight. It's over.

541
00:50:17,643 --> 00:50:20,354
Joffrey will bear these scars
for the rest of his life.

542
00:50:21,897 --> 00:50:25,442
You let that little girl disarm you?

543
00:50:31,657 --> 00:50:34,618
Ned, see to it that your daughter
is disciplined.

544
00:50:34,743 --> 00:50:37,538
- I'll do the same with my son.
- Gladly, Your Grace.

545
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:40,749
And what of the direwolf?

546
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:43,961
What of the beast
that savaged your son?

547
00:50:47,005 --> 00:50:49,424
I'd forgot the damned wolf.

548
00:50:49,508 --> 00:50:52,177
We found no trace of the direwolf
Your Grace.

549
00:50:52,344 --> 00:50:55,514
No? So be it.

550
00:50:55,639 --> 00:50:57,683
We have another wolf.

551
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:02,688
As you will.

552
00:51:02,813 --> 00:51:06,066
- You can't mean it.
- A direwolfs no pet.

553
00:51:06,149 --> 00:51:08,360
Get her a dog.
She'll be happier for it.

554
00:51:09,653 --> 00:51:12,197
He doesn't mean Lady, does he?

555
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:14,908
No, no, not Lady!
Lady didn't bite anyone!

556
00:51:14,992 --> 00:51:17,119
- She's good!
- Lady wasn't there!

557
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:20,163
- You leave her alone!
- Stop them. Don't let them do it.

558
00:51:20,247 --> 00:51:22,708
Please, please, it wasn't Lady!

559
00:51:22,749 --> 00:51:24,543
Is this your command?

560
00:51:25,711 --> 00:51:27,129
Your Grace?

561
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:37,097
- Where is the beast?
- Chained up outside, Your Grace.

562
00:51:37,222 --> 00:51:39,183
Ser Ilyn, do me the honour.

563
00:51:39,308 --> 00:51:40,726
No.

564
00:51:41,685 --> 00:51:43,729
Jory...

565
00:51:45,189 --> 00:51:47,232
take the girls to their rooms.

566
00:51:51,528 --> 00:51:53,947
If it must be done,

567
00:51:54,031 --> 00:51:56,033
then I'll do it myself.

568
00:51:56,116 --> 00:51:58,202
Is this some trick?

569
00:51:58,285 --> 00:52:00,370
The wolf is of the North.

570
00:52:01,872 --> 00:52:04,333
She deserves better than a butcher.

571
00:52:37,824 --> 00:52:41,370
The butcher's boy -
you rode him down?

572
00:52:41,495 --> 00:52:43,497
He ran.

573
00:52:43,622 --> 00:52:45,207
Not very fast.

574
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:14,990
THAT BASTARD JOFFREY!!
Sync, corrected & Dothraki dialogue by <font color="#3333FF">MALAY DEV</font>

<font color=#00FFFF>Lord Snow</font>

3
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:15,719
Welcome, Lord Stark.

4
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,931
Grand Maester Pycelle has called
a meeting of the Small Council.

5
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,016
The honour of your presence is requested.

6
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:25,687
Get the girls settled in.
I'll be back in time for supper.

7
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,398
- And, Jory, you go with them.
- Yes, my lord.

8
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:32,027
If you'd like to change into something
more appropriate...

9
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,566
Thank the gods you're here, Stark.

10
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:14,778
About time we had
some stern northern leadership.

11
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:17,698
Glad to see you're protecting the throne.

12
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,783
Sturdy old thing.

13
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,244
How many kings' arses
have polished it, I wonder?

14
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,121
Um, what's the line?

15
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,499
The king shits and the Hand wipes.

16
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,835
Very handsome armour.

17
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,338
- Not a scratch on it.
- I know.

18
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:37,009
People have been swinging at me for years,
but they always seem to miss.

19
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,803
You've chosen your opponents wisely then.

20
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,056
I have a knack for it.

21
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:49,313
It must be strange for you,
coming into this room.

22
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,568
I was standing right here
when it happened.

23
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,654
He was very brave, your brother.

24
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,573
Your father, too.

25
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,700
They didn't deserve to die like that.

26
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,620
Nobody deserves to die like that.

27
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,580
But you just stood there and watched.

28
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,625
500 men just stood there and watched.

29
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,377
All the great knights
of the Seven Kingdoms.

30
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,838
You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger?

31
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,466
No, Lord Stark.

32
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:21,678
500 men and this room
was silent as a crypt.

33
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,934
Except for the screams, of course,

34
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,019
and the Mad King laughing.

35
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,729
And later...

36
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,399
when I watched the Mad King die,

37
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:37,819
I remembered him laughing
as your father burned...

38
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,822
it felt like justice.

39
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,453
Is that what you tell yourself at night?

40
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,374
You're a servant of justice?

41
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:54,962
That you were avenging my father when you
shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?

42
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:59,842
Tell me, if I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly
instead of the back,

43
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,718
would you admire me more?

44
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,890
You served him well...
when serving was safe.

45
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,072
Lord Stark.

46
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:25,993
Lord Varys.

47
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,830
I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles
on the Kingsroad.

48
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:33,584
We are all praying
for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.

49
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,920
A shame you didn't say a prayer
for the butcher's son.

50
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:41,341
Renly! You're looking well.

51
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,135
And you look tired from the road.

52
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,470
I told them this meeting could wait
another day, but...

53
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:48,265
But we have a kingdom
to look after.

54
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:51,476
I've hoped to meet you
for some time, Lord Stark.

55
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,063
- No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.
- She has, Lord Baelish.

56
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:58,192
I understand you knew
my brother Brandon as well.

57
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:01,486
All too well.
I still carry a token of his esteem...

58
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,488
from navel to collarbone.

59
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:05,657
Perhaps you chose
the wrong man to duel with.

60
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,576
It wasn't the man that I chose, my lord.

61
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,995
It was Catelyn Tully.

62
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,332
A woman worth fighting for,
I'm sure you'll agree.

63
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:16,043
I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.

64
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,670
Grand Maester.

65
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:21,048
How many years has it been?

66
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,635
- You were a young man.
- And you served another king.

67
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:29,181
Oh, how forgetful of me.

68
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,018
This belongs to you now.

69
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,481
Should we begin?

70
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,526
- Without the king?
- Winter may be coming,

71
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:43,904
but I'm afraid the same cannot
be said for my brother.

72
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,073
His Grace has many cares.

73
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:50,827
He entrusts some small matters to us
that we might lighten the load.

74
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,747
We are the lords of small matters here.

75
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:01,713
My brother instructs us
to stage a tournament

76
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,216
in honour of Lord Stark's appointment
as Hand of the King.

77
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:07,886
- Mm, how much?
- 40,000 gold dragons to the champion,

78
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,555
20,000 to the runner-up,

79
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,724
20,000 to the winning archer.

80
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,143
Can the treasury bear such expense?

81
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:18,105
I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters
will accommodate, I expect.

82
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:21,400
We already owe Lord Tywin three million gold.
What's another 80,000?

83
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,392
Are you telling me the Crown
is three million in debt?

84
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:27,239
- I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
- How could you let this happen?

85
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:31,493
The master of coin finds the money.
The king and the Hand spend it.

86
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:35,122
I will not believe Jon Arryn
allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.

87
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:38,041
Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice,

88
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,879
but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen.

89
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,464
"Counting coppers," he calls it.

90
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,384
I'll speak to him tomorrow.

91
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,720
This tournament is an extravagance
we cannot afford.

92
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:52,264
As you will.
But still, we'd best make our plans.

93
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,267
There will be no plans...
until I speak to Robert.

94
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,316
Forgive me, my lords. I'm...

95
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:06,820
- I had a long ride.
- You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark.

96
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,406
We serve at your pleasure.

97
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,498
- Ow!
- Please, it's nearly healed.

98
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,463
- It's ugly.
- A king should have scars.

99
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:28,300
You fought off a direwolf.
You're a warrior like your father.

100
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:32,095
I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything.
It bit me and all I did was scream.

101
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,848
And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.

102
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:37,976
That's not true. You killed the beast.

103
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,271
You only spared the girl because of the love
your father bears her father.

104
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:42,731
I didn't, I...

105
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:47,528
When Aerys Targaryen sat on the iron throne,
your father was a rebel and a traitor.

106
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:51,198
Someday you'll sit on the throne
and the truth will be what you make it.

107
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,745
Do I have to marry her?

108
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,706
Yes.

109
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,959
She's very beautiful and young.

110
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:05,337
If you don't like her, you only need
to see her on formal occasions

111
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:09,800
and when the time comes,
to make little princes and princesses.

112
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:14,847
And if you'd rather fuck painted whores,
you'll fuck painted whores.

113
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:17,474
And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins,
so be it.

114
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:21,770
You are my darling boy and the world
will be exactly as you want it to be.

115
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:27,693
Do something nice for the Stark girl.

116
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,611
- I don't want to.
- No, but you will.

117
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:34,575
The occasional kindness will spare you
all sorts of trouble down the road.

118
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:37,160
We allow the northerners too much power.

119
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:39,705
They consider themselves our equals.

120
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,331
How would you handle them?

121
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:47,129
I'd double their taxes and command them
to supply 10,000 men to the royal army.

122
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,463
A royal army?

123
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,382
Why should every lord
command his own men?

124
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,676
It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes.

125
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,846
We should have a standing army
of men loyal to the Crown,

126
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,639
trained by experienced soldiers,

127
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:01,351
instead of a mob of peasants
who've never held pikes in their lives.

128
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,812
And if the northerners rebel?

129
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,522
I'd crush them.

130
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:09,735
Seize Winterfell and install someone
loyal to the realm as warden of the North.

131
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,236
Uncle Kevan, maybe.

132
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:15,032
And these 10,000 northern troops,
would they fight for you or their lord?

133
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:17,326
- For me. I'm their king.
- Mm-hm.

134
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,411
But you've just invaded their homeland,

135
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:22,247
- asked them to kill their brothers.
- I'm not asking.

136
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:25,250
The North cannot be held,
not by an outsider.

137
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,419
It's too big and too wild.

138
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,203
And when the winter comes,
the seven gods together

139
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:31,340
couldn't save you and your royal army.

140
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:34,301
A good king knows
when to save his strength...

141
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:38,305
and when to destroy his enemies.

142
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,016
So you agree...

143
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:43,393
the Starks are enemies?

144
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:49,233
Everyone who isn't us...
is an enemy.

145
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,988
Enough of that, young lady.
Eat your food.

146
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,074
- I'm practising.
- Practising for what?

147
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,117
- The prince.
- Arya, stop!

148
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:02,371
He's a liar and a coward
and he killed my friend.

149
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,789
The Hound killed your friend.

150
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:06,333
The Hound does whatever
the prince tells him to do.

151
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,856
- You're an idiot.
- You're a liar, and if you told the truth,

152
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,087
Mycah would be alive.

153
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,588
Enough!

154
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:15,884
What's happening here?

155
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,220
Arya would rather act
like a beast than a lady.

156
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:22,266
Go to your room. We'll speak later.

157
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,817
That's for you, love.

158
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:44,997
The same dollmaker
makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys.

159
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,458
Don't you like it?

160
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:52,129
I haven't played with dolls since I was eight.

161
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:56,675
- May I be excused?
- You've barely eaten a thing.

162
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,928
It's all right. Go on.

163
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:11,231
War was easier than daughters.

164
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,363
Go away!

165
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,949
Arya, open the door.

166
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,170
May I come in?

167
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:42,387
- Whose sword is that?
- Mine.

168
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:44,181
Give it to me.

169
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:53,732
I know this maker's mark.
This is Mikken's work.

170
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,694
Where did you get this?

171
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:03,867
This is no toy.

172
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:08,705
- Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
- I wasn't playing.

173
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,749
And I don't want to be a lady.

174
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,085
Come here.

175
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,634
Now what do you want with this?

176
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,095
It's called Needle.

177
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,264
Oh, a blade with a name.

178
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,934
And who were you hoping
to skewer with Needle?

179
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:31,019
Your sister?

180
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:33,397
Do you know the first thing
about sword fighting?

181
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,274
Stick 'em with the pointy end.

182
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,193
That's the essence of it.

183
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:43,198
I was trying to learn.

184
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:47,703
I asked Mycah to practice with me.

185
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,292
I asked him. It was my fault.

186
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:58,589
No, sweet girl.
No, no, you didn't kill the butcher's boy.

187
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:03,135
I hate them. I hate all of them.

188
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,512
The Hound, the queen and the king

189
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:07,181
and Joffrey and Sansa.

190
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:09,933
Sansa was dragged
before the king and queen...

191
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:13,562
and asked to call the prince a liar.

192
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:16,190
So was I! He is a liar.

193
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:18,317
Shh, darling, listen to me.

194
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:22,446
Sansa will be married
to Joffrey someday.

195
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:25,199
She cannot betray him.

196
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:27,951
She must take his side
even when he's wrong.

197
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:31,914
But how you can let her
marry someone like that?

198
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,709
Well...

199
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,838
Look at me.

200
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:43,091
You're a Stark of Winterfell.
You know our words.

201
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:46,720
Winter is coming.

202
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:51,892
You were born in the long summer.
You've never known anything else.

203
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,353
But now winter is truly coming.

204
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:58,440
And in the winter
we must protect ourselves,

205
00:14:58,524 --> 00:14:59,900
look after one another.

206
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:02,319
Sansa is your sister.

207
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:05,781
I don't hate her.

208
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,824
Not really.

209
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:12,996
I don't want to frighten you,
but I won't lie to you either.

210
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,541
We've come to a dangerous place.

211
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:19,002
We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves.

212
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:22,005
All right?

213
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:25,342
Go on. It's yours.

214
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:30,514
I can keep it?

215
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:33,559
Try not to stab your sister with it.

216
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:46,446
If you're going to own a sword,
you'd better know how to use it.

217
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:57,958
Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars.

218
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:04,089
- I know a story about a crow.
- I hate your stories.

219
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:07,301
I know a story about a boy who hated stories.

220
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:11,013
I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall.

221
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:13,015
Those were always your favourites.

222
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,392
Those weren't my favourites.

223
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:18,020
My favourites were the scary ones.

224
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:23,609
Oh, my sweet summer child.
What do you know about fear?

225
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,945
Fear is for the winter

226
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:30,282
when the snows fall a hundred feet deep.

227
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:34,828
Fear is for the long night,
when the sun hides for years

228
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:39,917
and children are born and live and die,
all in darkness.

229
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,670
That is the time for fear, my little lord,

230
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:46,965
when the white walkers
move through the woods.

231
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:53,680
Thousands of years ago there came a night
that lasted a generation.

232
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:56,642
Kings froze to death in their castles,

233
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:58,894
same as the shepherds in their huts.

234
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:03,732
And women smothered their babies
rather than see them starve,

235
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:08,153
and wept and felt the tears
freeze on their cheeks.

236
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,782
So is this the sort of story that you like?

237
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:19,540
In that darkness, the white walkers
came for the first time.

238
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:22,668
They swept through cities and kingdoms,

239
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:24,878
riding their dead horses,

240
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:28,799
hunting with their packs of pale spiders
big as hounds...

241
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:35,180
What are you telling him now?

242
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,599
Only what the little lord wants to hear.

243
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:40,310
Get your supper. I want some time with him.

244
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,240
One time she told me

245
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:55,534
the sky is blue
because we live inside the eye

246
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:58,412
of a blue-eyed giant named Macomber.

247
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:00,581
Maybe we do.

248
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,127
How do you feel?

249
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,841
You still don't remember anything?

250
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:17,014
Bran, I've seen you climb
a thousand times.

251
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:18,932
In the wind, in the rain...

252
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:21,101
A thousand times.

253
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:23,437
- You never fall.
- I did though.

254
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:28,692
It's true, isn't it,

255
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:32,070
what Maester Luwin says about my legs?

256
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:41,496
I'd rather be dead.

257
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:46,043
- Don't ever say that.
- I'd rather be dead.

258
00:18:57,763 --> 00:19:00,265
Fewer eyes back here, my lady.

259
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:02,476
But still too many.

260
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:05,145
It's nine years since I've set foot
in the capital.

261
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:08,482
And no one knew who I was
the last time I came, either.

262
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,571
My lady.

263
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:17,824
Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark.
Would you mind following us?

264
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,743
I would. We've done nothing wrong.

265
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,037
We've been instructed
to escort you into the city.

266
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,872
Instructed?

267
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,583
I don't know who's providing
your instructions, but...

268
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,377
Follow me, Lady Stark.

269
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:40,514
Cat!

270
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:43,892
Go on. Go upstairs.

271
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:48,772
You little worm!

272
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:53,110
You take me for some back-alley Sally
you can drag into a...

273
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:56,572
Pssst!

274
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:03,078
I meant no disrespect,
to you of all people.

275
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:07,207
How dare you bring me here?
Have you lost your mind?

276
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:09,825
No one will come looking for you here.
Isn't that what you wanted?

277
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:13,422
I'm truly sorry... about the locale.

278
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:15,799
How did you know I was
coming to King's Landing?

279
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,844
A dear friend told me.

280
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:23,432
- Lady Stark.
- Lord Varys.

281
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:27,519
To see you again after so many years
is a blessing.

282
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:28,979
Your poor hands.

283
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,066
How did you know I was coming?

284
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,569
Knowledge is my trade, my lady.

285
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:39,865
Did you bring the dagger with you,
by any chance?

286
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:43,827
My little birds are everywhere...

287
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:46,079
even in the North.

288
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:49,666
They whisper to me
the strangest stories.

289
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,049
Valyrian steel.

290
00:20:57,216 --> 00:20:59,927
Do you know whose dagger this is?

291
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:03,639
I must admit I do not.

292
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:07,226
Well, well, this is an historic day.

293
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:11,563
Something you don't know that I do.

294
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:17,778
There's only one dagger like this
in all of the Seven Kingdoms.

295
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:21,823
- It's mine.
- Yours?

296
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:26,203
At least it was, until the tournament
on Prince Joffrey's last nameday.

297
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:29,206
I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting,

298
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:31,083
as any sane man would.

299
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:36,171
When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him,
I lost this dagger.

300
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:38,423
To whom?

301
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:40,425
Tyrion Lannister.

302
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:42,761
The Imp.

303
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:45,472
Grenn, show him
what you farm boys are made of.

304
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:53,730
If that were a real sword, you'd be dead.

305
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:59,486
Lord Snow here grew up in a castle
spitting down on the likes of you.

306
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:01,530
Pyp.

307
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:05,617
Do you think Ned Stark's bastard
bleeds like the rest of us?

308
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:15,586
Next!

309
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:27,764
Next!

310
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:45,115
Well, Lord Snow, it appears
you're the least useless person here.

311
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:47,367
Go clean yourselves up!

312
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:50,245
There's only so much
I can stomach in a day.

313
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:52,748
A charming man.

314
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,334
I don't need him to be charming.

315
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:58,504
I need him to turn this bunch
of thieves and runaways

316
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:00,047
into men of the Night's Watch.

317
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:03,509
And how's that going,
Commander Mormont?

318
00:23:03,634 --> 00:23:05,135
Slowly.

319
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:10,682
A raven came... for Ned Stark's son.

320
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,064
Good news or bad?

321
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:18,774
Both.

322
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:23,362
Lord Stark.

323
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:26,281
I meant...
to give you this earlier.

324
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,577
So forgetful these days.

325
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:35,207
A raven from Winterfell this morning.

326
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:48,136
Good news?

327
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:54,101
Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife.

328
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,231
- My wife is in Winterfell.
- Is she?

329
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:09,575
Yes, I'm looking at you.

330
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:14,913
I thought that she'd be safest in here.

331
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:17,791
One of several such
establishments I own.

332
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:21,628
You're a funny man.

333
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:24,131
Huh? A very funny man.

334
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:27,634
Ned!

335
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:36,143
Ah, the Starks...

336
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:39,104
Quick tempers, slow minds.

337
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:46,820
You broke my nose, bastard!

338
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:56,205
It's an improvement.

339
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:02,336
If we threw you over the Wall,
I wonder how long it would take you to hit.

340
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:04,671
I wonder if they'd find you
before the wolves did.

341
00:25:09,468 --> 00:25:11,470
What are you looking at, halfman?

342
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:14,139
I'm looking at you.

343
00:25:15,224 --> 00:25:19,394
Yes. You've got an interesting face.

344
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:23,565
Hmm, very distinctive faces.

345
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:25,275
All of you.

346
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,528
And what do you care about our faces?

347
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:29,404
It's just...

348
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:33,492
I think they would look marvellous
decorating spikes in King's Landing.

349
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:36,537
Perhaps I'll write to my sister,
the queen, about it.

350
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:41,124
We'll talk later, Lord Snow.

351
00:25:46,922 --> 00:25:51,385
Everybody knew what this place was
and no one told me.

352
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,845
No one but you.

353
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,516
My father knew and he left me to rot
at the Wall all the same.

354
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,726
Grenn's father left him too...

355
00:25:59,852 --> 00:26:02,980
outside a farmhouse, when he was three.

356
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:07,067
Pyp was caught stealing
a wheel of cheese.

357
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:10,445
His little sister hadn't eaten in three days.

358
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:14,241
He was given a choice -
his right hand or the Wall.

359
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:18,245
I've been asking the Lord Commander
about them. Fascinating stories.

360
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,247
They hate me because
I'm better than they are.

361
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:24,751
It's a lucky thing none of them were trained
by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik.

362
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:27,337
I don't imagine any of them
had ever held a real sword

363
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:29,464
before they came here.

364
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:34,720
Oh...

365
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:36,889
Your brother Bran.

366
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:40,058
He's woken up.

367
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:44,438
The mere suggestion that the queen's brother
tried to kill your boy

368
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:45,772
would be considered treason.

369
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:48,108
We have proof. We have the blade.

370
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,235
Which Lord Tyrion will say
was stolen from him.

371
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,821
The only man who could say otherwise
has no throat,

372
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:54,198
thanks to your boy's wolf.

373
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:58,076
Petyr has promised
to help us find the truth.

374
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:03,540
He's like a little brother to me, Ned.
He would never betray my trust.

375
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:06,126
I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake.

376
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:07,961
A fool's task, admittedly,

377
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:10,631
but I've never been able
to refuse your wife anything.

378
00:27:10,756 --> 00:27:12,799
I won't forget this.

379
00:27:12,883 --> 00:27:14,968
You're a true friend.

380
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:18,222
Don't tell anyone.
I have a reputation to maintain.

381
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:24,895
- How could you be so stupid?
- Calm down.

382
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,772
He's a child. Ten years old.

383
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:29,233
- What were you thinking?
- I was thinking of us.

384
00:27:29,316 --> 00:27:31,818
You're a bit late to start
complaining about it now.

385
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:35,739
- What has the boy told them?
- Nothing. He remembers nothing.

386
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:37,908
Then what are you raving about?

387
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:41,453
What if it comes back to him?
If he tells his father what he saw...

388
00:27:41,537 --> 00:27:43,830
We'll say he was lying.
We'll say he was dreaming.

389
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:47,793
We'll say whatever we like.
I think we can outfox a ten-year-old.

390
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:51,004
- And my husband?
- I'll go to war with him if I have to.

391
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:53,757
They can write a ballad about us -

392
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:55,551
"The War For Cersei's Cunt."

393
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:03,100
- Let me go.
- Never.

394
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:06,979
- Let me go.
- The boy won't talk.

395
00:28:07,896 --> 00:28:10,065
And if he does, I'll kill him.

396
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:13,527
Him, Ned Stark, the king -
the whole bloody lot of them,

397
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:18,115
until you and I are the only people
left in this world.

398
00:28:29,168 --> 00:28:31,086
I wish I could see the girls.

399
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,423
- It's too dangerous.
- Just for a moment.

400
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:36,675
Until we know who our enemies are.

401
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,886
I know they did it, Ned.
The Lannisters.

402
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:40,888
In my bones, I know it.

403
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:42,890
Littlefinger's right.

404
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:46,810
I can't do anything without proof.

405
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:49,479
And if you find the proof?

406
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:51,607
Then I bring it to Robert...

407
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,401
and hope he's still the man I once knew.

408
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:58,322
You watch yourself on the road, huh?

409
00:28:59,323 --> 00:29:01,742
That temper of yours
is a dangerous thing.

410
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:03,368
My temper?

411
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:07,372
Gods be good, you nearly killed
poor Littlefinger yesterday.

412
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:14,004
He still loves you.

413
00:29:15,172 --> 00:29:16,924
Does he?

414
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,151
Off with you.

415
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,520
Yes, it's been a long time.

416
00:30:12,563 --> 00:30:15,148
But I still remember every face.

417
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:18,861
You remember your first?

418
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:23,407
Of course, Your Grace.

419
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,492
Who was it?

420
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:27,202
A Tyroshi.

421
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:30,038
- Never learned the name.
- Hmm.

422
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:32,374
How did you do it?

423
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:34,418
Lance through the heart.

424
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:36,253
Quick one.

425
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:40,007
Lucky for you.

426
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:43,886
Mine was some Tarly boy
at the Battle of Summerhall.

427
00:30:45,554 --> 00:30:49,975
My horse took an arrow so I was on foot,
slogging through the mud.

428
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:56,565
He came running at me,
this dumb high-born lad,

429
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:01,361
thinking he could end the rebellion
with a single swing of his sword.

430
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:04,740
I knocked him down with the hammer.

431
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:07,201
Gods, I was strong then.

432
00:31:07,284 --> 00:31:10,037
Caved in his breastplate.

433
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,457
Probably shattered every rib he had.

434
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:17,169
Stood over him, hammer in the air.

435
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:23,342
Right before I brought it down
he shouted, "Wait! Wait."

436
00:31:29,014 --> 00:31:32,643
They never tell you
how they all shit themselves.

437
00:31:34,269 --> 00:31:37,064
They don't put that part in the songs.

438
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:41,068
Stupid boy.

439
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:48,367
Now the Tarlys bend the knee
like everyone else.

440
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:53,121
He could have lingered on the edge
of the battle with the smart boys,

441
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:56,792
and today his wife would
be making him miserable,

442
00:31:56,959 --> 00:31:59,795
his sons would be ingrates,

443
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:04,383
and he'd be waking three times in the night
to piss into a bowl.

444
00:32:04,508 --> 00:32:06,260
Wine!

445
00:32:08,971 --> 00:32:13,392
Lancel.
Gods, what a stupid name.

446
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:17,062
Lancel Lannister.

447
00:32:18,188 --> 00:32:22,276
Who named you?
Some halfwit with a stutter?

448
00:32:25,404 --> 00:32:27,406
What are you doing?

449
00:32:28,824 --> 00:32:31,451
- It's empty, Your Grace.
- What do you mean, it's empty?

450
00:32:31,577 --> 00:32:34,371
- There's no more wine.
- Is that what empty means?!

451
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:38,667
So get more.

452
00:32:42,546 --> 00:32:44,923
Tell your cousin to get in here.

453
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:48,135
Kingslayer! Get in here.

454
00:32:55,726 --> 00:32:58,812
Surrounded by Lannisters.

455
00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:02,649
Every time I close my eyes
I see their blond hair

456
00:33:02,733 --> 00:33:06,153
and their smug, satisfied faces.

457
00:33:07,112 --> 00:33:09,198
It must wound your pride, huh?

458
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:12,159
Standing out there like a glorified sentry.

459
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,456
Jaime Lannister
son of the mighty Tywin...

460
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:24,171
forced to mind the door while your king
eats and drinks and shits and fucks.

461
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:27,674
So come on.

462
00:33:27,758 --> 00:33:29,760
We're telling war stories.

463
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:34,640
Who was your first kill,
not counting old men?

464
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:38,519
One of the outlaws
in the brotherhood.

465
00:33:38,644 --> 00:33:41,146
I was there that day.

466
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:44,358
You were only a squire, 16 years old.

467
00:33:44,441 --> 00:33:47,319
You killed Simon Toyne
with a counter riposte.

468
00:33:47,444 --> 00:33:49,530
Best move I ever saw.

469
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:53,909
A good fighter, Toyne,
but he lacked stamina.

470
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:56,161
Your outlaw...

471
00:33:57,204 --> 00:33:58,705
any last words?

472
00:33:58,789 --> 00:34:01,542
- I cut his head off, so no.
- Hmm.

473
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:04,545
What about Aerys Targaryen?

474
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:08,465
What did the Mad King say
when you stabbed him in the back?

475
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:10,676
I never asked.

476
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:13,637
Did he call you a traitor?

477
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:16,765
Did he plead for a reprieve?

478
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:21,311
He said the same thing
he'd been saying for hours...

479
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,148
"Burn them all."

480
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:31,864
if that's all, Your Grace...

481
00:35:04,229 --> 00:35:06,648
Do the Dothraki buy their slaves?

482
00:35:06,732 --> 00:35:08,775
The Dothraki don't believe in money.

483
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:11,111
Most of their slaves were
given to them as gifts.

484
00:35:11,195 --> 00:35:12,654
From whom?

485
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:16,325
If you rule a city and you see the horde
approaching, you have two choices -

486
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,243
pay tribute or fight.

487
00:35:18,327 --> 00:35:20,078
An easy choice for most.

488
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,582
Of course, sometimes it's not enough.

489
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:27,085
Sometimes a khal feels insulted
by the number of slaves he's given.

490
00:35:27,336 --> 00:35:29,630
He might think the men too weak
or the women too ugly.

491
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:33,509
Sometimes a khal decides
his riders haven't had a good fight in months

492
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:37,194
- and need the practice.
- [Kash qoy qoyi thira disse] Only while blood of my blood lives.

493
00:35:39,765 --> 00:35:41,642
Tell them all to stop.

494
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:44,853
You want the entire horde to stop?
For how long?

495
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:48,774
Until I command them otherwise.

496
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:51,652
You're learning to talk like a queen.

497
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:53,695
Not a queen.

498
00:35:53,779 --> 00:35:55,656
A khaleesi.

499
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:08,418
[Annakhas dozgosores]
Stop the horde.

500
00:36:32,651 --> 00:36:34,695
You dare!

501
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:38,073
You give commands to me? To me?

502
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:43,704
You do not command the dragon.
I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

503
00:36:43,787 --> 00:36:48,542
I don't take orders from savages
or their sluts. Do you hear me?

504
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:54,037
[Hash shafka zali addrivat mae, zhey Khaleesi?]
Do you want him dead khaleesi?

505
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:56,592
Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.

506
00:36:56,758 --> 00:36:58,218
No.

507
00:36:58,343 --> 00:37:01,753
[Ishish chare acharoe hash me nem ejervae nharesoon.]
Maybe the ear will listen if it is removed from the head.

508
00:37:01,763 --> 00:37:04,266
Rakharo say you should take ear,
to teach respect.

509
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:07,019
Please. Please, don't hurt him.

510
00:37:11,148 --> 00:37:14,943
Tell him I don't want my brother harmed.

511
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:17,728
[Khaleesi vos zalo meme nem azisa]
Khaleesi, does not want him harmed.

512
00:37:17,738 --> 00:37:20,073
Huh?

513
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:23,827
[Chiftik]
Cricket.

514
00:37:27,664 --> 00:37:31,210
Mormont! Kill these Dothraki dogs!

515
00:37:36,507 --> 00:37:39,218
I am your king!

516
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:43,347
Shall we return to the khalasar, Khaleesi?

517
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,100
Uh uh uh uh uh.

518
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:08,705
You... walk.

519
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:43,360
I wanted to be here
when you saw it for the first time.

520
00:40:51,577 --> 00:40:54,830
- I'm leaving this morning.
- You're leaving?

521
00:40:55,914 --> 00:40:58,083
I'm the First Ranger.

522
00:40:58,166 --> 00:41:00,586
My job is out there.

523
00:41:00,711 --> 00:41:03,839
- There have been disturbing reports.
- What kind of reports?

524
00:41:03,922 --> 00:41:05,799
The kind I don't want to believe.

525
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:09,928
I'm ready. I won't let you down.

526
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:12,431
You're not going.

527
00:41:14,933 --> 00:41:16,727
You're no ranger, Jon.

528
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:19,479
- But I'm better than every...
- Better than no one!

529
00:41:24,735 --> 00:41:26,486
Here...

530
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:28,864
a man gets what he earns,

531
00:41:28,947 --> 00:41:31,033
when he earns it.

532
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:37,164
We'll speak when I return.

533
00:41:52,888 --> 00:41:55,891
- A bear's balls.
- Oh, you're joking?

534
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:59,353
And his brains and his guts,
his lungs and his heart,

535
00:41:59,561 --> 00:42:02,064
all fried in his own fat.

536
00:42:02,147 --> 00:42:04,733
When you're a hundred miles
north of the Wall

537
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:08,320
and you ate your last meal a week ago,
you leave nothing for the wolves.

538
00:42:09,029 --> 00:42:11,532
And how do a bear's balls taste?

539
00:42:11,657 --> 00:42:13,867
A bit chewy.

540
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:20,165
And what about you, my lord?
What's the strangest thing you've eaten?

541
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:21,917
Do Dornish girls count?

542
00:42:25,921 --> 00:42:31,176
So... you roam the Seven Kingdoms,
collaring pickpockets and horse thieves

543
00:42:31,343 --> 00:42:33,345
and bring them here as eager recruits?

544
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,180
Aye.

545
00:42:35,222 --> 00:42:38,225
But it's not all of 'em's done bad things.

546
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:41,228
Some of 'em's just poor lads
looking for steady feed.

547
00:42:41,353 --> 00:42:44,189
Some of 'em's high-born lads
looking for glory.

548
00:42:44,314 --> 00:42:46,441
They have a better chance finding feed
than glory.

549
00:42:49,111 --> 00:42:51,238
The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it?

550
00:42:52,364 --> 00:42:56,577
Is that what we are, Lannister?
An army of jesters in black?

551
00:42:56,702 --> 00:42:58,787
You don't have enough men
to be an army

552
00:42:58,912 --> 00:43:02,457
and, aside from Yoren here,
none of you are particularly funny.

553
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:05,294
I hope we've provided you
with some good stories to tell

554
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:07,129
when you're back in King's Landing.

555
00:43:07,296 --> 00:43:10,883
It's something to think about
while you're drinking your wine down there,

556
00:43:11,008 --> 00:43:13,010
enjoying your brothels.

557
00:43:14,094 --> 00:43:17,389
Half the boys you've seen training
will die north of the Wall.

558
00:43:18,265 --> 00:43:20,684
Might be a wildling's axe that gets them,

559
00:43:20,851 --> 00:43:23,437
might be sickness,

560
00:43:23,562 --> 00:43:26,273
might just be the cold.

561
00:43:26,356 --> 00:43:28,150
They die in pain.

562
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:30,819
And they do it...

563
00:43:30,944 --> 00:43:36,074
so plump little lords like you can enjoy their
summer afternoons in peace and comfort.

564
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:40,662
Do you think I'm plump?

565
00:43:43,957 --> 00:43:47,586
- Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?
- Call me what you like.

566
00:43:47,669 --> 00:43:50,005
I'm not sure what I've done to offend you.

567
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:52,174
I have great admiration for the Night's Watch.

568
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:54,718
I've great admiration
for you as First Ranger.

569
00:43:54,885 --> 00:43:56,845
You know, my brother once told me...

570
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:01,475
that nothing someone says
before the word "but" really counts.

571
00:44:01,558 --> 00:44:03,227
But...

572
00:44:04,144 --> 00:44:07,272
I don't believe that giants and ghouls
and white walkers

573
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:09,149
are lurking beyond the Wall.

574
00:44:10,067 --> 00:44:13,320
I believe that the only difference
between us and the wildlings

575
00:44:13,487 --> 00:44:16,198
is that when that wall went up,
our ancestors happened

576
00:44:16,281 --> 00:44:18,408
to live on the right side of it.

577
00:44:18,492 --> 00:44:20,327
You're right.

578
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:24,164
The wildlings are no different from us.

579
00:44:25,123 --> 00:44:27,042
A little rougher maybe.

580
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:29,795
But they're made of meat and bone.

581
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,506
I know how to track them
and I know how to kill them.

582
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:36,301
It's not the wildlings
giving me sleepless nights.

583
00:44:37,594 --> 00:44:42,015
You've never been north of the Wall
so don't tell me what's out there.

584
00:44:45,602 --> 00:44:47,604
Are you going below?

585
00:44:49,189 --> 00:44:52,442
- Keep well, keep warm.
- Enjoy the capital, brother.

586
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:54,319
Oh, I always do.

587
00:45:03,537 --> 00:45:05,706
I think he's starting to like me.

588
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,837
- "Going below"?
- Aye.

589
00:45:12,004 --> 00:45:15,757
Into the tunnel and out the other side.

590
00:45:15,799 --> 00:45:18,468
He'll be north of the Wall
for a month or two.

591
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:23,724
So... you're heading down
to King's Landing too.

592
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:26,435
Aye, day after tomorrow.

593
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:30,272
I get about half of my recruits
from their dungeons.

594
00:45:30,355 --> 00:45:34,526
Let's share the road.
I could use some decent company.

595
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:36,778
I, er...

596
00:45:36,862 --> 00:45:39,615
I travel a bit on the grubby side, my lord.

597
00:45:39,698 --> 00:45:43,619
Not this time. We'll be staying
at the finest castles and inns.

598
00:45:43,744 --> 00:45:46,121
No one turns away a Lannister.

599
00:45:58,425 --> 00:45:59,925
[Athjahakar]
Pride, prowess

600
00:46:00,385 --> 00:46:02,185
[Athjahakar]
Pride, prowess

601
00:46:02,262 --> 00:46:03,931
Yes, Khaleesi.

602
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:07,935
Oh, what are you doing?

603
00:46:08,018 --> 00:46:10,604
When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi?

604
00:46:13,065 --> 00:46:15,025
You change, Khaleesi.

605
00:46:16,485 --> 00:46:19,085
[Me azhasavva vezhofoon.]
it's a blessing from the Great Stallion.

606
00:46:24,243 --> 00:46:28,288
For a man on horseback,
the curved blade is a good thing,

607
00:46:28,372 --> 00:46:30,082
easier to handle.

608
00:46:30,249 --> 00:46:33,085
It's a good weapon for a 'Dothrakaan'.
[Dothrakaan = Rider]

609
00:46:34,294 --> 00:46:38,423
But a man in full plate... shori tawakof
[shori tawakof = steel dress]

610
00:46:38,549 --> 00:46:40,634
...the arakh won't get through the steel.

611
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,971
That's where the broadsword
has the advantage.

612
00:46:44,012 --> 00:46:46,974
Designed for piercing plate.

613
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,450
[Dothraki vos ondeo shoris tawakofi]
Dothraki don't wear steel dresses.

614
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,439
- Armour.
- Armour.

615
00:46:54,565 --> 00:46:57,150
Armour make a man, erm...

616
00:46:57,317 --> 00:46:59,278
- Vroz?
- Slow.

617
00:46:59,403 --> 00:47:02,990
- Slow.
- It's true, but it also keeps a man alive.

618
00:47:04,449 --> 00:47:07,169
[Ave anni ezzo anhaan os lajataan.]
My father taught me how to fight.

619
00:47:07,244 --> 00:47:10,664
[Me ezzo anhaan m'athdikar assie athzhokwazar.]
He taught me that speed defeats size.

620
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:13,542
I've heard that
your father was a famous warrior.

621
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:16,003
He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo.

622
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:22,541
[Majin ave yeri Jorah Andahli? Hash me lajakoon akka?]
And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?

623
00:47:22,551 --> 00:47:25,012
He still is.

624
00:47:25,095 --> 00:47:27,514
A man of great honour

625
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:29,474
and I betrayed him.

626
00:47:34,479 --> 00:47:36,805
[Khaleesi zala meme adakha esinakh ajjalan. Ogi loy mawizzi.]
The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight.

627
00:47:36,815 --> 00:47:38,817
Kill some rabbits.

628
00:47:38,942 --> 00:47:40,986
[Vo mawizzi vekho jinne]
There are no rabbits.

629
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:44,871
[Ezas loy alegri h'anhaan. Mori allayafi mae, jin alegra.]
Find some ducks me, she likes ducks.

630
00:47:44,907 --> 00:47:48,483
[Hash yer ray tih loy alegra zhey vikeesi? Vo mawizzi, vo alegri.]
Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks.

631
00:47:48,493 --> 00:47:50,986
[Hash tihi vekhi she nhare yeroon? Hash tih?]
Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?

632
00:47:50,996 --> 00:47:53,155
[Majin jano. Anha ray tih san jani.]
Dog then. I have seen many dogs.

633
00:47:53,165 --> 00:47:55,542
I don't think she wants to eat dog.

634
00:47:58,921 --> 00:48:01,590
The khaleesi have baby inside her.

635
00:48:03,217 --> 00:48:06,470
It is true. She does not bleed
for two moons.

636
00:48:06,595 --> 00:48:08,931
Her belly start to swell.

637
00:48:10,724 --> 00:48:13,101
[Azhasavva vezhofoon]
A blessing from the Great Stallion.

638
00:48:13,185 --> 00:48:15,229
She does not want to eat horse.

639
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:19,066
I'll have the boys
butcher a goat for supper.

640
00:48:24,363 --> 00:48:26,907
I need to ride to Qohor.

641
00:48:29,952 --> 00:48:33,872
Uh, we ride for Vaes Dothrak.

642
00:48:33,956 --> 00:48:36,208
Don't worry. I'll catch you.

643
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:38,710
The horde's easy to find.

644
00:48:50,055 --> 00:48:54,601
Don't stand so still.
It's harder to hit a moving target.

645
00:48:58,856 --> 00:49:01,692
Except for you. You move too much.

646
00:49:01,817 --> 00:49:04,361
I could just hold my sword out
and let you do the work for me.

647
00:49:09,825 --> 00:49:12,953
How many winters
have you seen, Lord Tyrion?

648
00:49:13,036 --> 00:49:15,289
Eight. No, nine.

649
00:49:15,747 --> 00:49:17,833
All of them brief?

650
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:21,003
They say the winter of my birth
was three years long, Maester Aemon.

651
00:49:21,128 --> 00:49:24,173
This summer has lasted nine.

652
00:49:24,298 --> 00:49:28,510
But reports from the citadel
tell us the days grow shorter.

653
00:49:28,594 --> 00:49:30,971
The Starks are always right eventually -

654
00:49:31,096 --> 00:49:33,515
winter is coming.

655
00:49:34,433 --> 00:49:36,476
This one will be long...

656
00:49:37,394 --> 00:49:39,521
and dark things will come with it.

657
00:49:39,563 --> 00:49:44,234
We've been capturing wildlings,
more every month.

658
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:45,652
They're fleeing south.

659
00:49:45,777 --> 00:49:49,907
The ones who flee...
say they've seen the white walkers.

660
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:53,285
Yes, and the fishermen
of Lannisport say they see mermaids.

661
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:56,872
One of our own rangers swore he saw them
kill his companions.

662
00:49:56,955 --> 00:50:01,001
He swore it right up to the moment
Ned Stark chopped his head off.

663
00:50:01,084 --> 00:50:05,547
The Night's Watch is the only thing
standing between the realm

664
00:50:05,631 --> 00:50:08,050
and what lies beyond.

665
00:50:08,175 --> 00:50:13,722
And it has become an army
of undisciplined boys and tired old men.

666
00:50:13,889 --> 00:50:16,475
There are less than a thousand of us now.

667
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:20,312
We can't man the other castles on the Wall.

668
00:50:20,479 --> 00:50:23,398
We can't properly patrol the wilderness.

669
00:50:23,524 --> 00:50:27,903
We've barely enough resources
to keep our lads armed and fed.

670
00:50:28,028 --> 00:50:31,949
Your sister sits by the side of the king.

671
00:50:33,617 --> 00:50:36,286
Tell her... we need help.

672
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:41,208
When winter does come,
gods help us all if we're not ready.

673
00:51:03,897 --> 00:51:05,566
[Me rakh]
It's a boy.

674
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:12,322
[Kifinosi yer nesi?]
How do you know?

675
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,702
[Anha sekke nesa.]
I very knows.

676
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:50,402
I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.

677
00:51:52,279 --> 00:51:54,239
It's either me or this cold,

678
00:51:54,364 --> 00:51:56,617
and it doesn't appear
to be going anywhere.

679
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,494
Will you stop at Winterfell
on your way south?

680
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:00,829
I expect I will.

681
00:52:00,913 --> 00:52:05,083
Gods know there aren't many feather beds
between here and King's Landing.

682
00:52:05,167 --> 00:52:07,211
If you see my brother Bran,

683
00:52:07,294 --> 00:52:09,963
tell him I miss him.

684
00:52:10,756 --> 00:52:12,216
Tell him I'd visit if I could.

685
00:52:12,299 --> 00:52:13,592
Of course.

686
00:52:14,676 --> 00:52:16,136
He'll never walk again.

687
00:52:16,261 --> 00:52:20,057
If you're going to be a cripple,
it's better to be a rich cripple.

688
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,559
You take care, Snow.

689
00:52:22,684 --> 00:52:24,520
Farewell, my lord.

690
00:52:36,406 --> 00:52:38,825
[Foreign accent] You are late, boy.

691
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:43,205
Tomorrow you will be here at midday.

692
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:45,582
Who are you?

693
00:52:46,291 --> 00:52:49,503
Your dancing master, Syrio Forel.

694
00:52:53,799 --> 00:52:55,259
Tomorrow you will catch it.

695
00:52:55,384 --> 00:52:57,177
Now pick it up.

696
00:52:59,638 --> 00:53:01,932
That is not the way, boy.

697
00:53:02,015 --> 00:53:06,144
It is not a greatsword that is needing
two hands to swing it.

698
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:10,232
- It's too heavy.
- It is heavy as it needs to be

699
00:53:10,315 --> 00:53:12,109
to make you strong.

700
00:53:13,151 --> 00:53:14,611
Just so.

701
00:53:14,736 --> 00:53:17,030
One hand is all that is needed.

702
00:53:18,407 --> 00:53:20,407
Now you are standing all wrong.

703
00:53:20,534 --> 00:53:22,870
Turn your body sideface.

704
00:53:22,995 --> 00:53:25,247
Yes.

705
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:27,583
So.

706
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:30,002
You are skinny. That is good.

707
00:53:30,794 --> 00:53:32,921
The target is smaller.

708
00:53:33,046 --> 00:53:35,132
Now the grip - let me see.

709
00:53:36,258 --> 00:53:37,885
Yes.

710
00:53:37,968 --> 00:53:40,637
The grip must be delicate.

711
00:53:41,722 --> 00:53:43,557
What if I drop it?

712
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,018
The steel must be part of your arm.

713
00:53:46,143 --> 00:53:48,770
Can you drop part of your arm? No.

714
00:53:48,854 --> 00:53:52,941
Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword
to the Sealord of Braavos.

715
00:53:53,025 --> 00:53:55,777
He knows these things.
You must listen to me, boy.

716
00:53:55,903 --> 00:53:57,613
I'm a girl.

717
00:53:57,696 --> 00:54:03,118
Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all.

718
00:54:04,786 --> 00:54:06,580
That is the grip.

719
00:54:06,663 --> 00:54:09,666
You are not holding a battle-axe.
You are holding...

720
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:11,126
A needle.

721
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:13,879
Ahhh.

722
00:54:14,755 --> 00:54:16,465
Just so.

723
00:54:16,507 --> 00:54:19,301
Now we will begin the dance.

724
00:54:19,468 --> 00:54:20,844
Remember, child,

725
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:23,805
this is not the dance of the Westeros
we are learning...

726
00:54:23,889 --> 00:54:27,726
The knight's dance,
hacking and hammering.

727
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:31,563
This is the Braavos dance...

728
00:54:33,065 --> 00:54:34,983
the water dance.

729
00:54:35,108 --> 00:54:37,277
It is swift...

730
00:54:37,361 --> 00:54:39,613
and sudden.

731
00:54:41,073 --> 00:54:43,283
All men are made of water.

732
00:54:43,408 --> 00:54:45,118
Do you know this?

733
00:54:45,202 --> 00:54:47,538
If you pierce them,

734
00:54:47,621 --> 00:54:51,250
the water leaks out and they die.

735
00:54:52,543 --> 00:54:55,754
Now you will try to strike me.

736
00:54:58,882 --> 00:55:00,676
Ha!

737
00:55:12,437 --> 00:55:13,814
Up!

738
00:55:17,317 --> 00:55:18,318
Ha!

739
00:55:29,705 --> 00:55:30,914
Ah.

740
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:35,002
Dead.

741
00:55:35,085 --> 00:55:36,086
Oh!

742
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:37,838
Dead.

743
00:55:37,921 --> 00:55:39,798
Hup!

744
00:55:42,384 --> 00:55:44,386
Very dead.

745
00:55:44,469 --> 00:55:46,305
Come.

746
00:55:47,014 --> 00:55:49,057
Ah ah ah!

747
00:55:49,183 --> 00:55:51,935
Hup!

748
00:55:52,644 --> 00:55:54,521
Again, faster.

749
00:55:58,984 --> 00:56:00,903
Ah.

750
00:56:05,069 --> 00:56:10,906
ARYA STARK IS GOING TO BE A BADASS!!!

3
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,331
The little lord's
been dreaming again.

4
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,424
- We have visitors.
- I don't want to see anyone.

5
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,094
Really?
If I was cooped up all day

6
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:00,222
with no one but this old bat
for company, I'd go mad.

7
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,809
Anyway, you don't have a choice.
Robb's waiting.

8
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:06,854
- I don't want to go.
- Neither do I.

9
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,772
I
But Robb's Lord of Winterfell

10
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:11,900
which means I do what he says,
and you do what I say.

11
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,070
Hodor!

12
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,660
- Hodor?
- Help Bran down the hall.

13
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,787
Hodor.

14
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:33,338
I must say I received
a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.

15
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:36,049
Any man of the Night's Watch
is welcome at Winterfell.

16
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,760
Any man of the Night's Watch,
but not I, eh, boy?

17
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:41,138
I'm not your boy, Lannister.

18
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,348
I'm Lord of Winterfell
while my father is away.

19
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:46,727
Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.

20
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,689
So it's true.

21
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,860
Hello, Bran.

22
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,237
Do you remember anything
about what happened?

23
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,781
He has no memory of that day.

24
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,451
- Curious.
- Why are you here?

25
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:06,622
Would your charming companion
be so kind as to kneel?

26
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:10,209
- My neck is beginning to hurt.
- Kneel, Hodor.

27
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,589
- Do you like to ride, Bran?
- Yes.

28
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,799
Well, I mean I did like to.

29
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,385
- The boy has lost the use of his legs.
- What of it?

30
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:22,711
With the right horse and saddle,
even a cripple can ride.

31
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,641
- I'm not a cripple.
- Then I'm not a dwarf.

32
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,726
My father will rejoice to hear it.

33
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,103
I have a gift for you.

34
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:33,106
Give that to your saddler.
He'll provide the rest.

35
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:37,528
You must shape
the horse to the rider.

36
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:41,990
Start with a yearling and teach it to respond
to the reins and to the boy's voice.

37
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:46,078
- Will I really be able to ride?
- You will.

38
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,372
On horseback you will be
as tall as any of them.

39
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:51,750
Is this some kind of trick?
Why do you want to help him?

40
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:56,380
I have a tender spot in my heart
for cripples, bastards and broken things.

41
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,633
You've done my brother a kindness.

42
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,718
The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.

43
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:06,932
Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark.
There's a brothel outside your walls.

44
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,893
There I'll find a bed
and both of us can sleep easier.

45
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,651
Couldn't resist some northern arse?

46
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,279
If you like Redheads, ask for Ros.

47
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:23,323
Come to see me off, Greyjoy?
Kind of you.

48
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,701
Your master doesn't seem
to like Lannisters.

49
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,912
- He's not my master.
- No, of course not.

50
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:33,250
What happened here? Where is Lady Stark?
Why didn't she receive me?

51
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,128
- She wasn't feeling well.
- She's not in Winterfell, is she?

52
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,005
- Where did she go?
- M'lady's whereabouts...

53
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,632
M'lady?

54
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,552
Your loyalty to your captors is touching.

55
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,638
Tell me, how do you think
Balon Greyjoy would feel

56
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:50,684
if he could see his only surviving son
has turned lackey?

57
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:54,688
I still remember seeing
my father's fleet burn in Lannisport.

58
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,483
- I believe your uncles were responsible.
- Must have been a pretty sight.

59
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:01,778
Nothing prettier
than watching sailors burn alive.

60
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:06,408
Yes, a great victory for your people.
Shame how it all turned out.

61
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,786
- We were outnumbered ten to one.
- A stupid rebellion, then.

62
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,291
I suppose your father realised that
when your brothers died in battle.

63
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,711
Now here you are,
your enemy's squire.

64
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,671
- Careful, Imp.
- I've offended you.

65
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:23,008
Forgive me, it's been
a rough morning.

66
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,011
Anyway, don't despair.

67
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,305
I'm a constant disappointment
to my own father

68
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,682
and I've learned to live with it.

69
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,602
Your next tumble with Ros is on me.

70
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,772
I'll try not to wear her out.

71
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,029
Shoulder, legs.

72
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:51,995
Leg, shoulder, leg.

73
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,998
Left foot forward. Good.

74
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:59,127
Now pivot as you deliver the stroke.
Put all your weight behind it.

75
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:01,630
What in seven hells is that?

76
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:06,260
They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.

77
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,303
Tell them your name.

78
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,389
Samwell Tarly,

79
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,393
of Horn Hill...
I mean, I was of Horn Hill.

80
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:16,103
I've come to take the black.

81
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:18,856
Come to take the black pudding.

82
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,859
Well, you couldn't be
any worse than you look.

83
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,902
Rast...

84
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:26,029
see what he can do.

85
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,789
I yield.

86
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,458
- Please, no more.
- On your feet.

87
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,711
Pick up your sword.

88
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,463
Hit him till he finds his feet.

89
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,517
It seems they've run short
of poachers and thieves down south.

90
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,353
- Now they send us squealing bloody pigs.
- Jon!

91
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,772
Again, harder.

92
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:04,359
- I yield!
- Enough!

93
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,404
He yielded.

94
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,033
Looks like the bastard's in love.

95
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,871
All right then, Lord Snow,

96
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:19,166
you wish to defend your lady love,
let's make it an exercise.

97
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,252
You two. Three of you
ought to be sufficient

98
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,588
to make lady piggy squeal.

99
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,674
All you've got to do is
get past the bastard.

100
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,721
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- No.

101
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,987
Yield, yield, yield!
I yield.

102
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:54,535
We're done for today.
Go clean the armoury.

103
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,371
That's all you're good for.

104
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,876
- Well fought!
- Piss off.

105
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,717
- Did he hurt you?
- I've had worse.

106
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:14,805
You can call me Sam...
if you want.

107
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,934
- My mother calls me Sam.
- It's not going to get any easier, you know?

108
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:22,646
- You're going to have to defend yourself.
- Why didn't you get up and fight?

109
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:26,024
I wanted to.

110
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,902
- I just couldn't.
- Why not?

111
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,614
I'm a coward.

112
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:36,785
- My father always says so.
- The Wall's no place for cowards.

113
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,871
You're right. I'm sorry.

114
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:42,749
I just... wanted to thank you.

115
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,720
A bloody coward.

116
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:58,932
People saw us talking to him.
Now they'll think we're cowards too.

117
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,851
You're too stupid to be a coward.

118
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,853
- You're too stupid to be a...
- Quick now,

119
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,856
before summer's over.

120
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,983
Come here!

121
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:39,723
Hyah, hyah!

122
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:47,022
Vaes Dothrak -
the city of the horselords.

123
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:51,652
A pile of mud.
Mud and shit and twigs.

124
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:55,280
- Best these savages can do.
- These are my people now.

125
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:57,773
- You shouldn't call them savages.
- I'll call them what I like,

126
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:01,578
because they're my people.
This is my army.

127
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:05,707
Khal Drogo is marching
the wrong way with my army.

128
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:27,479
If my brother was given
an army of Dothraki,

129
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:31,149
could you conquer
the Seven Kingdoms?

130
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:34,069
The Dothraki have never
crossed the narrow sea.

131
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,363
They fear any water
their horses can't drink.

132
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,073
But if they did?

133
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:42,578
King Robert is fool enough
to meet them in open battle,

134
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:45,289
but the men
advising him are different.

135
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:49,751
- And you know these men?
- I fought beside them once,

136
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:51,795
long ago.

137
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,256
Now Ned Stark wants my head.

138
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,633
He drove me from my land.

139
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,345
You sold slaves.

140
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,140
Aye.

141
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:08,020
- Why?
- I had no money

142
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:10,230
and an expensive wife.

143
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,149
And where is she now?

144
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,484
In another place,

145
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,820
with another man.

146
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,245
- Your Grace?
- Yes, my dear?

147
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,915
They call you the last dragon...

148
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:30,626
They do.

149
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,006
You have dragon's blood in your veins?

150
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,133
It's entirely possible.

151
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,720
What happened to the dragons?

152
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:44,890
I was told that brave men
killed them all.

153
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:51,939
The brave men didn't kill dragons.

154
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:54,483
The brave men rode them.

155
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:57,986
Rode them from Valyria
to build the greatest civilization

156
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,572
this world has ever seen.

157
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:05,035
The breath of the greatest dragon
forged the Iron Throne,

158
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,038
which the Usurper is
keeping warm for me.

159
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,125
The swords of the vanquished,

160
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:14,378
a thousand of them...

161
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:18,841
melted together
like so many candles.

162
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:25,931
I have always wanted
to see a dragon.

163
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,560
There's nothing in the world
that I would rather see.

164
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,229
Really. Why dragons?

165
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,815
They can fly.

166
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,901
And wherever they are,
just a few flaps of their wings

167
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,487
and they're somewhere else...

168
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,656
far away.

169
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,536
And they can kill.

170
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:52,749
Anyone or anything
that tries to hurt them

171
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,461
gets burned away to nothing...

172
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,297
...melted...

173
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:01,216
like so many candles.

174
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,926
Ow.

175
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:08,891
Yes. Seeing a dragon
would make me very happy.

176
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:11,018
Well, after 15 years
in a pleasure house,

177
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:13,729
I imagine just seeing the sky
makes you happy.

178
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:16,648
I was not locked in.
I have seen things.

179
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:18,483
- What have you seen?
- I've seen...

180
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:22,487
a man from Asshai
with a dagger of real dragonglass.

181
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,489
- Ooh.
- I've seen a man who could

182
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:29,286
change his face the way
that other men change their clothes.

183
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,998
And I've seen a pirate
who wore his weight in gold

184
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:37,586
and whose ship had
sails of coloured silk.

185
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,881
So...

186
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,468
have you seen one?

187
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:47,638
- A pirate ship?
- A dragon.

188
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,641
No.

189
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:54,269
No, the last one died
many years before I was born.

190
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:57,439
I'll tell you what I have seen -

191
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,734
their skulls.

192
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:03,820
They used to decorate
the throne room in the Red Keep.

193
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,440
When I was very young,
just three or four,

194
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,991
my father used
to walk me down the rows

195
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:10,369
and I'd recite
their names for him.

196
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:14,164
When I got them all right,
he'd give me a sweet.

197
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:17,167
The ones closest to the door
were the last ones they were able to hatch

198
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:21,839
and they were all stunted and wrong
with skulls no bigger than dog skulls.

199
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:27,469
But... but as you got closer
to the Iron Throne...

200
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,848
they got bigger

201
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:33,976
and bigger and bigger.

202
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:39,273
There was Ghiscar

203
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,859
and Valryon,

204
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,735
Vermithrax,

205
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,029
Essovius...

206
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:48,574
...Archonei,

207
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:51,994
Meraxes,

208
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,038
Vhagar...

209
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,793
and Balerion the Dread...

210
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:04,965
...whose fire forged
the Seven Kingdoms

211
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,134
into one.

212
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,974
What happened to the skulls?

213
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,561
I don't know.

214
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,939
The Usurper had them
smashed to powder, I expect.

215
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:23,901
Scattered to the wind.

216
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,824
- That's very sad.
- Yes, it is.

217
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:35,245
What did I buy you for?

218
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,540
- To make me sad?
- No, Your Grace.

219
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,920
To, uh, teach your sister.

220
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:46,048
To teach my sister how
to be a better lover?

221
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:49,343
You think I bought you
to make Khal Drogo happy?

222
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:56,767
Oh, you pretty little idiot.

223
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,938
Go on, then.
Get on with it.

224
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:15,994
Someday your husband will sit there
and you will sit by his side.

225
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:21,583
And one day, before too long,
you will present your son to the court.

226
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:26,338
All the lords of Westeros
will gather here to see the little prince.

227
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:28,549
- What if I have a girl?
- Gods be good,

228
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:31,593
you'll have boys and girls
and plenty of them.

229
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:33,804
What if I only have girls?

230
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:35,806
I wouldn't worry about that.

231
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:39,101
Jeyne Poole's mother
had five children - all of them girls.

232
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:41,144
Yes, but it's highly unlikely.

233
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:43,605
But what if?

234
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:47,025
Well, if you only had girls,

235
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:50,654
I suppose the throne would pass
to Prince Joffrey's little brother.

236
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,448
And everyone would hate me.

237
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,617
Nobody could ever hate you.

238
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:58,495
- Joffrey does.
- Nonsense.

239
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:00,998
Why would you say such a thing?

240
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,918
That business with the wolves? Sansa...

241
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:06,962
I've told you
a hundred times -

242
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,965
- a direwolf is not...
- Please shut up about it.

243
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:13,218
Do you remember your lessons?

244
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:20,017
- Who built the Iron Throne?
- Aegon the Conqueror.

245
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:23,687
- And who built the Red Keep?
- Maegor the Cruel.

246
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,606
And how many years
did it take to build...

247
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:30,027
My grandfather and uncle
were murdered here, weren't they?

248
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:33,405
They were killed
on the orders of King Aerys, yes.

249
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:37,784
- The Mad King.
- Commonly known as the Mad King.

250
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:40,621
Why were they killed?

251
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:44,249
You should speak to your father
about these matters.

252
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,460
I don't want to speak
to my father, ever.

253
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:49,713
Sansa, you will
find it in your heart

254
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:53,467
- to forgive your father.
- No, I won't.

255
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:56,979
It's the Hand's Tournament
that's causing all this trouble, my lords.

256
00:18:57,054 --> 00:19:02,309
The King's Tournament.
I assure you the Hand wants no part of it.

257
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:04,436
Call it what you will, Lord Stark, ser,

258
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:07,689
the city is packed with people
and more flooding in every day.

259
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,651
Last night we had
a tavern riot, a brothel fire,

260
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:13,737
three stabbings and a drunken horse race
down the Street of Sisters.

261
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,532
- Dreadful.
- If you can't keep the king's peace,

262
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:19,660
perhaps the City Watch should be
commanded by someone who can.

263
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,370
- I need more men.
- You'll get 50.

264
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:24,373
- Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
- I will?

265
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:27,918
You found money for a champion's purse,
you can find money to keep the peace.

266
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:31,964
I'll also give you
20 of my household guard

267
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:35,467
- till the crowds have left.
- Thank you, my lord Hand, ser.

268
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:38,345
They will be put to good use.

269
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:41,473
The sooner this is over, the better.

270
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:44,309
The realm prospers
from such events, my lord.

271
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:48,564
They give the great a chance at glory,
and the lowly a respite from their woes.

272
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:51,441
And every inn
in the city is full

273
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:53,443
and the whores
are walking bow-legged.

274
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:55,946
I'm sure the tourney
puts coins in many a pocket.

275
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,532
- Hmm.
- Now...

276
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:01,076
if there's nothing else, my lords?

277
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:12,880
Oh, this heat.

278
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:15,799
On days like this,
I envy you northerners,

279
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:18,719
your summer snows.
Until tomorrow, my lord.

280
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:21,513
I've been hoping
to talk to you about Jon Arryn.

281
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:24,308
Lord Arryn?

282
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:28,979
Oh, his death was
a great sadness to all of us.

283
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:34,109
I took personal charge of his care,
but I could not save him.

284
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:39,990
His sickness struck him
very hard and very fast.

285
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:44,620
I saw him in my chambers
just the night before he passed.

286
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:49,583
- Lord Jon often came to me for counsel.
- Why?

287
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:54,379
I have been grand maester
for many years.

288
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:57,591
Kings and Hands have come to me
for advice since...

289
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,594
What did Jon want
the night before he died?

290
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:03,055
Oh, he came inquiring after a book.

291
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:06,433
A book? What book?

292
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,938
Oh, I fear it would be
of little interest to you, my lord.

293
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:13,565
A... A ponderous tome.

294
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:17,110
No, I'd like to read it.

295
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:22,533
The Lineages and Histories

296
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:25,827
of the Great Houses
of the Seven Kingdoms,

297
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:28,956
with descriptions
of many high lords

298
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,084
and noble ladies

299
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,253
and their children.

300
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:53,897
Harkon Umber
first of his name,

301
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:57,693
born to Lord Hother Umber
and Lady Amaryllis Umber

302
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:00,362
in the 183rd year
after Aegon's landing,

303
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:03,699
at the Last Hearth.
Blue of eye, brown of hair

304
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:07,160
and fair complected,
died in his 14th year

305
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:09,496
of a wound sustained in a bear hunt.

306
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:13,292
As I said, my lord,
a ponderous read.

307
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,003
Did Jon Arryn tell you
what he wanted with it?

308
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:18,922
He did not, my lord.
And I did not presume to ask.

309
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:21,258
- Jon's death...
- Such a tragedy.

310
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:23,802
...did he say anything to you
during his final hours?

311
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:25,804
Nothing of import, my lord.

312
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:30,559
Oh. There was one phrase
he kept repeating.

313
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:33,979
"The seed is strong,"
I think it was.

314
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:36,315
- "The seed is strong"?
- Mmm.

315
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,692
- What does that mean?
- Oh,

316
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:42,446
the dying mind is
a demented mind, Lord Stark.

317
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,615
For all the weight they're given,

318
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:48,452
last words are usually
as significant as first words.

319
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:51,580
And you're quite certain
he died of a natural illness?

320
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:53,707
What else could it be?

321
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:58,879
- Poison.
- A disturbing thought.

322
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:01,256
No, no, no, I don't think it likely.

323
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:05,844
The Hand was loved by all.
What sort of man would dare...

324
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,639
I've heard it said that poison
is a woman's weapon.

325
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:13,101
Yes, women, cravens...

326
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:14,937
and eunuchs.

327
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:19,191
Did you know that
Lord Varys is a eunuch?

328
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:23,487
- Everybody knows that.
- Yes, yes, of course.

329
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:26,323
How that sort of person
found himself

330
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:30,452
- on the king's council, I will never know.
- I've taken enough of your time.

331
00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:33,497
No trouble at all, my lord.
It's a great honour.

332
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:35,165
Thank you.

333
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:37,292
I'll find my own way out.

334
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:04,152
Syrio says a water dancer
can stand on one toe for hours.

335
00:24:04,236 --> 00:24:06,154
It's a hard fall down these steps.

336
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:10,534
Syrio says every hurt is a lesson
and every lesson makes you better.

337
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:16,290
- Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.
- Cats? Syrio says.

338
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:18,750
He says every swordsman
should study cats.

339
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:21,837
They're as quiet as shadows
and as light as feathers.

340
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:26,008
- You have to be quick to catch them.
- He's right about that.

341
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:30,220
Now that Bran's awake,
will he come live with us?

342
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:35,684
Well, he needs to get
his strength back first.

343
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:37,895
He wants to be
a knight of the Kingsguard.

344
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:42,191
- He can't be one now, can he?
- No.

345
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:48,363
But someday
he could be lord of a holdfast

346
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:51,408
or sit on the king's council.

347
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:56,288
Or he might raise castles
like Brandon the Builder.

348
00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:00,667
Can I be lord of a holdfast?

349
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:07,716
You will marry a high lord
and rule his castle.

350
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:12,930
And your sons shall be knights
and princes and lords.

351
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:17,017
- Hmm?
- No.

352
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,062
That's not me.

353
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,670
Hello.

354
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:48,757
Ser Alliser said I'm to be
your new watch partner.

355
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:53,053
I should warn you,

356
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:55,556
I don't see all that well.

357
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:58,559
Come stand by the fire.

358
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:01,812
- It's warmer.
- No, that's all right. I'm fine.

359
00:26:01,937 --> 00:26:04,606
You're not. You're freezing.

360
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:19,413
I don't like high places.

361
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:23,375
You can't fight. You can't see.

362
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,879
You're afraid of heights
and almost everything else probably.

363
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:29,923
What are you doing here, Sam?

364
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:38,182
On the morning of my 18th nameday,
my father came to me.

365
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:42,686
"You're almost a man now," he said.

366
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:47,024
"But you're not worthy
of my land and title.

367
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:49,651
"Tomorrow, you're going
to take the black,

368
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:53,155
"forsake all claim
to your inheritance and start north.

369
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:57,534
"If you do not," he said,

370
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:00,996
"then we'll have a hunt

371
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:04,208
"and somewhere in these woods
your horse will stumble

372
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:07,127
"and you'll be thrown
from your saddle to die.

373
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:11,340
"Or so I'll tell your mother.

374
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:13,842
"Nothing would please me more."

375
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:23,602
Ser Alliser's going to make me
fight again tomorrow, isn't he?

376
00:27:23,644 --> 00:27:25,604
Yes, he is.

377
00:27:26,522 --> 00:27:28,232
I'm not going to get
any better, you know.

378
00:27:29,775 --> 00:27:31,610
Well...

379
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:33,403
you can't get any worse.

380
00:27:43,622 --> 00:27:46,333
I hear you're reading a boring book.

381
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,168
Hmph.

382
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:51,964
- Pycelle talks too much.
- Oh, he never stops.

383
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:54,424
Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale?

384
00:27:55,384 --> 00:27:57,010
Not surprising.

385
00:27:57,135 --> 00:28:01,682
Until recently, he was only
a squire - Jon Arryn's squire.

386
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:05,978
He was knighted almost immediately
after his master's untimely death.

387
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:08,105
Knighted for what?

388
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:12,734
- Why are you telling me this?
- I promised Cat that I'd help you.

389
00:28:12,818 --> 00:28:15,070
Where is Ser Hugh?

390
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:17,865
- I'll speak to him.
- A singularly bad idea.

391
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,450
Do you see that boy there?

392
00:28:20,576 --> 00:28:23,120
One of Varys's little birds.

393
00:28:23,245 --> 00:28:26,832
The spider has taken a great interest
in your comings and goings.

394
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:28,834
Now look there.

395
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:31,837
That one belongs to the queen.

396
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:36,133
And do you see that septa
pretending to read her book?

397
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:40,345
- Varys or the queen?
- No, she's one of mine.

398
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:46,185
Is there someone in your service
whom you trust completely?

399
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:50,814
- Yes.
- The wiser answer was no, my lord.

400
00:28:51,857 --> 00:28:56,153
Get a message to
this paragon of yours - discreetly.

401
00:28:56,278 --> 00:28:58,822
Send him to question Ser Hugh.

402
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:02,951
After that, you might want him
to visit a certain armourer in the city.

403
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:05,913
He lives in a large house
at the top of the Street of Steel.

404
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:08,415
- Why?
- I have my observers, as I said,

405
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,876
and it's possible
that they saw Lord Arryn

406
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:15,047
visit this armourer several times
in the weeks before his death.

407
00:29:16,632 --> 00:29:19,510
Lord Baelish, perhaps
I was wrong to distrust you.

408
00:29:19,593 --> 00:29:24,014
Distrusting me was the wisest thing
you've done since you climbed off your horse.

409
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:33,690
. .22, 23,

410
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:37,611
24, 5, 6, 2T,

411
00:29:37,736 --> 00:29:39,446
- 28, 29...
- Ser Hugh?

412
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:41,573
30, 31, 32...

413
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:43,909
- Ser Hugh!
- As you can see, I'm busy.

414
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:49,164
I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark,
the Hand of the King.

415
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:52,793
- I'm the captain of his guard.
- I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, Ser...

416
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:56,046
- No "ser". I'm not a knight.
- I see.

417
00:29:56,088 --> 00:29:58,799
Well, it just so happens that I am.

418
00:30:03,637 --> 00:30:06,890
He said he'd be glad
to talk to the Hand himself.

419
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:10,185
- He's a knight, you see.
- Ah, a knight.

420
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:13,772
They strut around
like roosters down here.

421
00:30:13,856 --> 00:30:16,775
Even the ones who've never seen
an arrow coming their way.

422
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,610
You shouldn't be out here, my lord.

423
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:23,156
- There's no telling who has eyes where.
- Let them look.

424
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:27,411
The former Hand did call on me,
my lord, several times.

425
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:30,497
I regret to say he did not honour me
with his patronage.

426
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:35,043
- What did Lord Arryn want?
- He always came to see the boy.

427
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:39,298
- I'd like to see him as well.
- As you wish, my lord.

428
00:30:39,381 --> 00:30:41,300
Gendry!

429
00:30:44,887 --> 00:30:46,388
Here he is.

430
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:49,474
Strong for his age.
He works hard.

431
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:52,436
Show the Hand
the helmet you made, lad.

432
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:08,994
- This is fine work.
- It's not for sale.

433
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:11,038
Boy, this is the King's Hand!

434
00:31:11,163 --> 00:31:14,541
- If his Lordship wants the helmet...
- I made it for me.

435
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:18,337
- Forgive him, my lord.
- There's nothing to forgive.

436
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,965
When Lord Arryn came to visit you,
what would you talk about?

437
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,967
He just asked me
questions is all, my lord.

438
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:26,094
What kind of questions?

439
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:31,225
About my work at first,

440
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:34,394
if I was being treated well,
if I liked it here.

441
00:31:36,438 --> 00:31:39,358
But then he started
asking me about my mother.

442
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:42,945
- Your mother?
- Who she was, what she looked like.

443
00:31:43,028 --> 00:31:45,405
What did you tell him?

444
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:49,576
She died when I was little.

445
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:51,537
She had yellow hair.

446
00:31:52,246 --> 00:31:54,790
She'd sing to me sometimes.

447
00:31:58,043 --> 00:31:59,795
Look at me.

448
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:11,473
Get back to work, lad.

449
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:17,604
If the day ever comes when that boy
would rather wield a sword than forge one,

450
00:32:18,647 --> 00:32:21,108
you send him to me.

451
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:26,572
Find anything?

452
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:29,825
King Robert's bastard son.

453
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:35,539
He likes that.

454
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:40,002
This is for the king from Lord Stark.

455
00:32:40,085 --> 00:32:42,171
Should I leave it with...

456
00:32:42,296 --> 00:32:45,883
Shhh. Listen.

457
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:48,552
Do you hear them?

458
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:54,391
How many do you think
are in there with him? Huh?

459
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:56,935
- Guess.
- Three.

460
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:59,104
Four.

461
00:33:00,898 --> 00:33:03,442
He likes to do this when I'm on duty.

462
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:05,611
He makes me listen
as he insults my sister.

463
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:13,609
- Forgive me, my lord...
- Why do I have to forgive you?

464
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:15,037
Have you wronged me?

465
00:33:16,872 --> 00:33:21,335
- We've met before, you know.
- Have we? Strange, I've forgotten.

466
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:25,088
The siege of Pyke.
We fought side by side one afternoon.

467
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:26,924
Ah.

468
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:28,967
- That's where you got your scar?
- Aye.

469
00:33:29,051 --> 00:33:32,262
- Oh.
- One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.

470
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:35,182
- Vicious sons of whores.
- They like their bloodshed.

471
00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:37,601
They stopped liking it at the end.

472
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:40,896
That was a proper battle.

473
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:44,233
Do you remember Thoros of Myr
charging through the breach?

474
00:33:44,358 --> 00:33:48,362
With his burning sword?
I'll remember that till the day I die.

475
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:51,657
I saw the youngest
of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell.

476
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:54,409
It was like seeing a shark
on a mountaintop.

477
00:33:54,576 --> 00:33:57,871
- Theon? He's a good lad.
- I doubt it.

478
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:05,295
I'll bet you smell
of blackberry jam!

479
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,257
Let me smell it. Come here.

480
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:12,803
Can I leave this with you?
The message from Lord Stark.

481
00:34:12,845 --> 00:34:15,097
I don't serve Lord Stark.

482
00:34:38,287 --> 00:34:40,747
- Where have you been?
- Watch duty.

483
00:34:40,873 --> 00:34:43,125
- With Sam.
- Ah, Prince Porkchop.

484
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,085
- Where is he?
- He wasn't hungry.

485
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:46,962
Impossible!

486
00:34:47,045 --> 00:34:49,131
That's enough.

487
00:34:55,345 --> 00:34:58,265
Sam's no different from the rest of us.

488
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:01,894
There was no place for him in the world,
so he's come here.

489
00:35:01,977 --> 00:35:04,438
We're not going to hurt him
in the training yard anymore.

490
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:07,274
Never again,
no matter what Thorne says.

491
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:09,860
He's our brother now
and we're going to protect him.

492
00:35:09,902 --> 00:35:13,488
You are in love, Lord Snow.

493
00:35:14,865 --> 00:35:17,868
You girls can do as you please.

494
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:20,704
But if Thorne puts me
up against Lady Piggy,

495
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:22,873
I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon.

496
00:35:45,938 --> 00:35:48,649
No one touches Sam.

497
00:36:02,996 --> 00:36:05,165
What are you waiting for?

498
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:16,134
Attack him!

499
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,647
You get in there.

500
00:36:33,402 --> 00:36:35,070
Hit me.

501
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:38,407
Go on, hit me!

502
00:36:40,617 --> 00:36:42,995
I yield!

503
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,955
Yield. Yield.

504
00:36:45,122 --> 00:36:47,207
I yield.

505
00:36:50,169 --> 00:36:52,546
You think this is funny, do you?

506
00:36:56,258 --> 00:37:00,971
When you're out there
beyond the Wall with the sun going down,

507
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:02,806
do you want a man at your back?

508
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:05,267
Or a snivelling boy?

509
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:22,326
You send this whore
to give me commands?

510
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:25,078
I should have sent you back her head!

511
00:37:25,162 --> 00:37:27,414
Forgive me, Khaleesi.
I did as you asked.

512
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:30,542
Hush now. It's all right.
Irri, take her and leave us.

513
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:32,836
Yes, Khaleesi.

514
00:37:35,297 --> 00:37:38,050
- Why did you hit her?!
- How many times do I have to tell you?

515
00:37:38,175 --> 00:37:41,929
- You do not command me.
- I wasn't commanding you.

516
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:43,639
I just wanted to invite you to supper.

517
00:37:43,722 --> 00:37:45,891
- What's this?
- It's a gift.

518
00:37:45,974 --> 00:37:48,602
- I had it made for you.
- Dothraki rags?

519
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:50,562
- Are you going to dress me now?
- Please.

520
00:37:50,646 --> 00:37:53,106
This stinks of manure. All of it.

521
00:37:53,232 --> 00:37:55,108
Stop. Stop. Stop it.

522
00:37:55,234 --> 00:37:57,694
You would turn me
into one of them, wouldn't you?

523
00:37:57,778 --> 00:38:00,447
- Next you'll want to braid my hair.
- You've no right to a braid.

524
00:38:00,531 --> 00:38:05,285
- You've won no victories yet.
- You do not talk back to me!

525
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:11,041
You are a horselord's slut.
And now you've woken the dragon...

526
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,384
I am a khaleesi of the Dothraki!

527
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:25,514
I am the wife of the great khal
and I carry his son inside me.

528
00:38:25,597 --> 00:38:29,393
The next time you raise a hand to me

529
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:32,563
will be the last time you have hands.

530
00:38:40,404 --> 00:38:43,740
I know for a fact that some of the officers
go to that brothel in Mole's Town.

531
00:38:43,824 --> 00:38:46,243
I wouldn't doubt it.

532
00:38:46,368 --> 00:38:48,537
Don't you think it's a little bit unfair?

533
00:38:48,662 --> 00:38:53,750
Making us take our vows while they sneak off
for a little Sally on the side?

534
00:38:53,876 --> 00:38:56,253
- Sally on the side?
- It's silly, isn't it?

535
00:38:56,378 --> 00:38:59,715
What, we can't defend
the Wall unless we're celibate?

536
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:04,469
- It's absurd.
- I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.

537
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:07,264
Why not?

538
00:39:07,431 --> 00:39:09,183
Because I'm fat?

539
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:12,686
- No.
- But I like girls just as much as you do.

540
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:16,440
They might not like me as much.

541
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:21,612
I've never... been with one.

542
00:39:23,071 --> 00:39:25,532
You've probably had hundreds.

543
00:39:25,574 --> 00:39:26,575
No.

544
00:39:28,911 --> 00:39:30,662
As a matter of fact,

545
00:39:31,622 --> 00:39:33,332
I'm the same as you.

546
00:39:33,498 --> 00:39:35,459
Yeah. Yeah, I...

547
00:39:35,626 --> 00:39:37,294
I find that hard to believe.

548
00:39:37,419 --> 00:39:39,922
I came very close once.

549
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:43,133
I was alone in a room
with a naked girl, but...

550
00:39:44,134 --> 00:39:47,554
- Didn't know where to put it?
- I know where to put it.

551
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:49,515
Was she...

552
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,725
old and ugly?

553
00:39:52,684 --> 00:39:54,478
Young and gorgeous.

554
00:39:55,938 --> 00:39:57,898
A whore named Ros.

555
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,027
What colour hair?

556
00:40:02,194 --> 00:40:04,863
- Red.
- Oh, I like red hair.

557
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:07,824
And her, um...

558
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:09,701
Her...

559
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:12,329
- You don't want to know.
- What, that good?

560
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:14,164
- Better.
- Oh, no.

561
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:21,338
So why exactly did you not make love
to Ros with the perfect...?

562
00:40:23,257 --> 00:40:26,844
- What's my name?
- Jon Snow.

563
00:40:27,636 --> 00:40:29,930
And why is my surname Snow?

564
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:32,933
Because...

565
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:35,394
you're a bastard from the North.

566
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:39,815
I never met my mother.

567
00:40:39,898 --> 00:40:42,609
My father wouldn't even
tell me her name.

568
00:40:42,693 --> 00:40:44,820
I don't know if she's living or dead.

569
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:51,326
I don't know if she's a noblewoman
or a fisherman's wife...

570
00:40:53,245 --> 00:40:55,205
or a whore.

571
00:40:57,332 --> 00:40:59,751
So I sat there

572
00:40:59,835 --> 00:41:03,046
in the brothel as Ros
took off her clothes.

573
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:06,675
But I couldn't do it.

574
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:12,181
Because all I could think was
what if I got her pregnant

575
00:41:12,264 --> 00:41:17,311
and she had a child,
another bastard named Snow?

576
00:41:21,857 --> 00:41:24,735
It's not a good life for a child.

577
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:26,945
Ah, mmm.

578
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,200
So...

579
00:41:32,034 --> 00:41:33,994
you didn't know where to put it?

580
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,835
Enjoying yourselves?

581
00:41:43,879 --> 00:41:45,797
You look cold, boys.

582
00:41:45,923 --> 00:41:48,800
It is a bit nippy.

583
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:51,720
A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire,

584
00:41:51,887 --> 00:41:53,805
indoors.

585
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:55,599
It's still summer.

586
00:41:56,558 --> 00:41:59,478
Do you boys even remember
the last winter?

587
00:42:00,354 --> 00:42:03,440
How long has it been now?
What, 10 years?

588
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:06,068
I remember.

589
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:08,612
Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell?

590
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:10,697
Were there days when
you just couldn't get warm,

591
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:14,117
never mind how many fires
your servants built?

592
00:42:14,243 --> 00:42:17,079
- I build my own fires.
- That's admirable.

593
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:21,250
I spent six months out there,
beyond the Wall

594
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:24,127
during the last winter.

595
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:28,131
It was supposed to be
a two-week mission.

596
00:42:28,215 --> 00:42:31,468
We heard a rumour Mance Rayder
was planning to attack Eastwatch.

597
00:42:31,552 --> 00:42:34,388
So we went out to look
for some of his men -

598
00:42:34,513 --> 00:42:37,140
capture them,
gather some knowledge.

599
00:42:37,224 --> 00:42:40,769
The wildlings who fight
for Mance Rayder are hard men.

600
00:42:40,894 --> 00:42:43,021
Harder than you'll ever be.

601
00:42:43,105 --> 00:42:45,607
They know their country
better than we do.

602
00:42:45,691 --> 00:42:48,193
They knew there was
a storm coming in.

603
00:42:49,236 --> 00:42:52,781
So they hid in their caves
and waited for it to pass.

604
00:42:53,949 --> 00:42:56,368
And we got caught in the open.

605
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:58,245
Wind so strong

606
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:02,416
it yanked 100-foot trees
straight from the ground, roots and all.

607
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:05,294
If you took your gloves off
to find your cock to have a piss,

608
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:08,463
you lost a finger to the frost.

609
00:43:08,547 --> 00:43:10,382
And all in darkness.

610
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:16,096
You don't know cold.

611
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:18,098
Neither of you do.

612
00:43:20,726 --> 00:43:22,936
The horses died first.

613
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:28,650
We didn't have enough
to feed them, to keep them warm.

614
00:43:30,527 --> 00:43:32,946
Eating the horses was easy.

615
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:37,993
But later when we started to fall...

616
00:43:39,786 --> 00:43:41,830
That wasn't easy.

617
00:43:43,207 --> 00:43:46,793
We should have had a couple of boys
like you along, shouldn't we?

618
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:54,051
Soft, fat boys like you.

619
00:43:54,218 --> 00:43:59,139
We'd have lasted a fortnight on you
and still had bones left over for soup.

620
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:04,728
Soon we'll have new recruits

621
00:44:04,811 --> 00:44:08,106
and you lot will be passed along
to the lord commander

622
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:10,192
for assignment,

623
00:44:10,317 --> 00:44:14,780
and they will call you
men of the Night's Watch,

624
00:44:14,863 --> 00:44:16,490
but you'd be fools to believe it.

625
00:44:18,242 --> 00:44:20,077
You're boys still.

626
00:44:20,244 --> 00:44:23,789
And come the winter you will die...

627
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:27,334
like flies.

628
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,926
I hit him.

629
00:44:36,051 --> 00:44:37,427
I hit the dragon.

630
00:44:37,511 --> 00:44:39,805
Your brother Rhaegar
was the last dragon.

631
00:44:39,888 --> 00:44:42,516
Viserys is less than
the shadow of a snake.

632
00:44:42,558 --> 00:44:46,687
- He is still the true king.
- The truth now.

633
00:44:46,854 --> 00:44:50,816
Do you want to see your brother
sitting on the Iron Throne?

634
00:44:50,899 --> 00:44:52,401
No.

635
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:55,529
But the common people
are waiting for him.

636
00:44:55,571 --> 00:44:59,908
Illyrio said they are sewing dragon banners
and praying for his return.

637
00:45:00,033 --> 00:45:04,705
The common people pray for rain,
health and a summer that never ends.

638
00:45:04,788 --> 00:45:08,083
They don't care
what games the high lords play.

639
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:10,878
What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?

640
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:16,258
Home.

641
00:45:17,509 --> 00:45:19,595
I pray for home too.

642
00:45:23,223 --> 00:45:26,101
My brother will never take back
the Seven Kingdoms.

643
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:31,648
He couldn't lead an army
even if my husband gave him one.

644
00:45:34,526 --> 00:45:36,862
He'll never take us home.

645
00:45:56,798 --> 00:45:58,967
Lovers' quarrel?

646
00:45:59,051 --> 00:46:00,552
I'm sorry. Do I...?

647
00:46:00,636 --> 00:46:03,055
Sansa dear
this is Lord Baelish.

648
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,307
- He's known...
- An old friend of the family.

649
00:46:06,183 --> 00:46:08,352
I've known your mother a long, long time.

650
00:46:08,477 --> 00:46:10,646
- Why do they call you Littlefinger?
- Arya!

651
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:13,565
- Don't be rude!
- No, it's quite all right.

652
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:17,778
When I was a child, I was very small,

653
00:46:17,861 --> 00:46:20,062
and I come from a little spit of land
called the Fingers,

654
00:46:20,072 --> 00:46:24,243
SO you See,
it's an exceedingly clever nickname.

655
00:46:24,368 --> 00:46:27,037
I've been sitting here for days!

656
00:46:27,162 --> 00:46:30,707
Start the damn joust
before I piss myself!

657
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:41,051
Gods, who's that?

658
00:46:41,176 --> 00:46:43,554
Ser Gregor Clegane.

659
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:46,557
They call him the Mountain.

660
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:50,853
The Hound's older brother.

661
00:46:50,936 --> 00:46:54,106
- And his opponent?
- Ser Hugh of the Vale.

662
00:46:54,231 --> 00:46:56,066
He was Jon Arryn's squire.

663
00:46:56,191 --> 00:46:57,776
Look how far he's come.

664
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:02,114
Yes, yes, enough of
the bloody pomp. Have at him!

665
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:24,112
Not what you were expecting?

666
00:48:27,616 --> 00:48:31,245
Has anyone ever told you the story
of the Mountain and the Hound?

667
00:48:32,704 --> 00:48:35,040
Lovely little tale of brotherly love.

668
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,670
The Hound was just a pup,

669
00:48:39,795 --> 00:48:41,964
six years old maybe.

670
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:44,091
Gregor a few years older,

671
00:48:44,174 --> 00:48:47,970
already a big lad,
already getting a bit of a reputation.

672
00:48:48,053 --> 00:48:53,976
Some lucky boys just born
with a talent for violence.

673
00:48:54,101 --> 00:49:00,190
One evening Gregor found his little brother
playing with a toy by the fire -

674
00:49:00,315 --> 00:49:02,609
Gregor's toy,

675
00:49:02,693 --> 00:49:05,362
a wooden knight.

676
00:49:05,487 --> 00:49:07,364
Gregor never said a word,

677
00:49:07,489 --> 00:49:10,450
he just grabbed his brother
by the scrum of his neck

678
00:49:10,534 --> 00:49:13,871
and shoved his face
into the burning coals.

679
00:49:13,996 --> 00:49:17,624
Held him there
while the boy screamed,

680
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:19,877
while his face melted.

681
00:49:24,423 --> 00:49:28,051
There aren't very many people
who know that story.

682
00:49:28,135 --> 00:49:31,722
- I won't tell anyone. I promise.
- No, please don't.

683
00:49:31,805 --> 00:49:35,100
If the Hound so much as
heard you mention it,

684
00:49:35,225 --> 00:49:39,521
I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing
would not be able to save you.

685
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:55,370
My lord, Her Grace the queen.

686
00:49:58,498 --> 00:50:01,168
- Your Grace.
- You're missing your tournament.

687
00:50:01,293 --> 00:50:04,463
Putting my name on it
doesn't make it mine.

688
00:50:05,964 --> 00:50:09,384
I thought we might put what happened
on the Kingsroad behind us,

689
00:50:09,468 --> 00:50:12,137
the ugliness with the wolves.

690
00:50:13,472 --> 00:50:15,933
And forcing you to kill the beast
was extreme.

691
00:50:17,226 --> 00:50:20,729
Though sometimes we go to extremes
where our children are concerned.

692
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,732
How is Sansa?

693
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:27,736
- She likes it here.
- She's the only Stark who does.

694
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:31,782
Favours her mother
not much of the North in' her.

695
00:50:31,865 --> 00:50:35,577
- What are you doing here?
- I might ask the same of you.

696
00:50:35,702 --> 00:50:37,788
What is it you hope to accomplish?

697
00:50:37,913 --> 00:50:40,749
The king called on me
to serve him and the realm,

698
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:43,252
and that's what I'll do
until he tells me otherwise.

699
00:50:43,335 --> 00:50:46,004
You can't change him.
You can't help him.

700
00:50:46,171 --> 00:50:48,757
He'll do what he wants,
which is all he's ever done.

701
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:51,635
You'll try your best
to pick up the pieces.

702
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,388
If that's my job, then so be it.

703
00:50:55,973 --> 00:50:58,350
You're just a soldier, aren't you?

704
00:50:58,433 --> 00:51:02,062
You take your orders
and you carry on.

705
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:04,106
I suppose it makes sense.

706
00:51:04,273 --> 00:51:07,276
Your older brother was trained to lead
and you were trained to follow.

707
00:51:07,401 --> 00:51:10,487
I was also trained to kill
my enemies, Your Grace.

708
00:51:14,241 --> 00:51:16,243
As was I.

709
00:51:34,344 --> 00:51:36,138
Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!

710
00:51:37,055 --> 00:51:38,056
And to you.

711
00:51:38,182 --> 00:51:40,350
Boy! Bread, meat and beer. Quickly.

712
00:51:40,475 --> 00:51:42,853
Ah, good idea, Grandfather.
I'm starving.

713
00:51:42,978 --> 00:51:46,565
- A song while we wait or...?
- I'd rather throw myself down a well.

714
00:51:46,648 --> 00:51:50,235
Now, now, Grandfather, this may be
your last chance if you're heading North.

715
00:51:50,402 --> 00:51:53,405
The only music the northerners know
is the howling of wolves!

716
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:57,034
Gods.

717
00:51:57,159 --> 00:51:58,702
I'm sorry, my lord. We're full up.

718
00:51:58,785 --> 00:52:01,663
- Every room.
- My men can sleep in the stable.

719
00:52:01,747 --> 00:52:04,875
As for myself, I don't
require a large room.

720
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,963
- Truly, my lord, we have nothing.
- Is there nothing I can do...

721
00:52:10,088 --> 00:52:12,466
...to remedy this?

722
00:52:12,591 --> 00:52:15,844
- You can have my room.
- Now there's a clever man.

723
00:52:17,471 --> 00:52:20,182
You can manage food, I trust?
Yoren, dine with me.

724
00:52:20,265 --> 00:52:22,226
- Aye, my lord.
- My lord of Lannister!

725
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:24,895
Might I entertain you while you eat?

726
00:52:24,978 --> 00:52:27,773
I can sing of your father's victory
at King's Landing!

727
00:52:27,898 --> 00:52:31,527
Nothing would more likely
ruin my supper.

728
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:35,781
Lady Stark!
What an unexpected pleasure.

729
00:52:36,448 --> 00:52:39,243
I was sorry to have
missed you at Winterfell.

730
00:52:39,368 --> 00:52:41,161
Lady Stark!

731
00:52:49,086 --> 00:52:53,799
I was still Catelyn Tully
the last time I stayed here.

732
00:52:56,176 --> 00:52:58,387
You, ser.

733
00:52:59,179 --> 00:53:03,600
Is that the black bat of Harrenhal
I see embroidered on your coat?

734
00:53:03,725 --> 00:53:05,185
It is, my lady.

735
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:07,980
And is Lady Whent
a true and honest friend

736
00:53:08,063 --> 00:53:12,109
to my father,
Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?

737
00:53:12,234 --> 00:53:13,777
She is.

738
00:53:15,904 --> 00:53:19,324
The red stallion was always
a welcome sight at Riverrun.

739
00:53:19,449 --> 00:53:24,746
My father counts Jonos Bracken amongst
his oldest and most loyal bannermen.

740
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:27,416
Our lord is honoured by his trust.

741
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:30,460
I envy your father
all his fine friends, Lady Stark,

742
00:53:30,586 --> 00:53:34,089
but I don't quite see
the purpose of this.

743
00:53:35,549 --> 00:53:37,551
I know your sigil as well -

744
00:53:38,844 --> 00:53:41,471
the twin towers of Frey.

745
00:53:41,597 --> 00:53:43,765
How fares your lord, ser?

746
00:53:44,433 --> 00:53:46,268
Lord Walder is well, my lady.

747
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:49,980
He has asked your father for the honour
of his presence on his 90th nameday.

748
00:53:50,105 --> 00:53:52,274
- He plans to take another wife.
- Ha!

749
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:00,866
This man...

750
00:54:00,949 --> 00:54:03,952
came into my house as a guest

751
00:54:03,994 --> 00:54:07,956
and there conspired
to murder my son.

752
00:54:08,832 --> 00:54:11,293
A boy of 10.

753
00:54:13,045 --> 00:54:16,215
In the name of King Robert
and the good lords you serve,

754
00:54:16,381 --> 00:54:19,134
I call upon you to seize him

755
00:54:19,927 --> 00:54:22,638
and help me return him to Winterfell

756
00:54:22,804 --> 00:54:25,098
to await the king's justice.

757
00:54:31,804 --> 00:54:36,164
GREAT SCENE!! ON TO THE NEXT EPISODE. NOW!!
Sync, corrected & Dothraki dialogue by <font color="#3333FF">MALAY DEV</font>

3
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,144
Does Ser Hugh have
any family in the capital?

4
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,771
No.

5
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,816
I stood vigil
for him myself last night.

6
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,819
He had no one else.

7
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,782
He'd never worn this armour before.

8
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:40,827
Bad luck for him -
going against the Mountain.

9
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,121
Who determines the draw?

10
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:45,374
All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark.

11
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,292
Aye.

12
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,628
But who holds the straws?

13
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:53,882
You've done good work, Sisters.

14
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,597
Life is strange.

15
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:04,142
Not so many years ago
we fought as enemies at the Trident.

16
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,187
I'm glad we never met
on the field, Ser Barristan.

17
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:10,524
As is my wife. I don't think
the widow's life would suit her.

18
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,860
You're too modest.

19
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:15,487
I've seen you cut down
a dozen great knights.

20
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:19,157
My father once told me
you were the best he'd ever seen.

21
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:22,202
I never knew the man to be wrong
about matters of combat.

22
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,329
He was a fine man, your father.

23
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,541
What the Mad King
did to him was a terrible crime.

24
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,251
And that lad -

25
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,378
he was a squire
until a few months ago.

26
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:34,506
How could he afford a new suit of armour?

27
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,967
Perhaps Lord Arryn
left him some money?

28
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:42,431
- I hear the king wants to joust today.
- Yes, that will never happen.

29
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:45,267
Robert tends
to do what he wants.

30
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,895
If the king got what
he wanted all the time,

31
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,522
he'd still be fighting
a damned rebellion.

32
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,572
It's made too small, Your Grace.
It won't go.

33
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,408
Your mother was
a dumb whore with a fat arse.

34
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,535
Did you know that?

35
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:09,082
Look at this idiot!
One ball and no brains.

36
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,002
He can't even put
a man's armour on him properly.

37
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,963
- You're too fat for your armour.
- Fat?

38
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,549
Fat, is it?

39
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,052
Is that how you speak to your king?

40
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:29,061
Oh, it's funny, is it?

41
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:34,024
- No, Your Grace.
- No?

42
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:36,527
You don't like the Hand's joke?

43
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,946
You're torturing the poor boy.

44
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,740
You heard the Hand.
The king's too fat for his armour.

45
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,785
Go find the breastplate
stretcher - now!

46
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:50,123
"The breastplate stretcher"?

47
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,334
How long before he figures it out?

48
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,629
- Maybe you should have one invented.
- All right, all right.

49
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,715
You watch me out there.
I still know how to point a lance.

50
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:01,468
You've no business jousting.
Leave that for the young men.

51
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,930
Why, because I'm king?
Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!

52
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,182
- And who's going to hit you back?
- Anybody who can.

53
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,185
- And the last man in his saddle...
- Will be you.

54
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,690
There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms
would risk hurting you.

55
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,150
Are you telling me
those cowards would let me win?

56
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:18,944
Aye.

57
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,743
- Drink.
- I'm not thirsty.

58
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:29,246
Drink. Your king commands it.

59
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,043
Gods,

60
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,629
too fat for my armour.

61
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:41,175
Your squire -
a Lannister boy?

62
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,760
Mm. A bloody idiot,

63
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,846
but Cersei insisted.

64
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,349
I have Jon Arryn to thank for her.

65
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,352
"Cersei Lannister will make
a good match," he told me.

66
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,147
"You'll need her father on your side."

67
00:05:57,107 --> 00:06:01,111
I thought being king
meant I could do whatever I wanted.

68
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,241
Enough of this.
Let's go watch 'em ride.

69
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,036
At least I can smell
someone else's blood.

70
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,163
- Robert.
- What?

71
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,875
Oh.

72
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,586
An inspiring sight for the people, eh?

73
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,547
Come, bow before your king!
Bow, you shits!

74
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:37,606
- Where's Arya?
- At her dancing lessons.

75
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,070
The Knight of the Flowers.

76
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,161
Thank you, Ser Loras.

77
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,945
Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.

78
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,739
- Hey.
- I can't watch.

79
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:32,786
A hundred gold dragons on the Mountain.

80
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:36,623
- I'll take that bet.
- Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons?

81
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,792
A dozen barrels of Dornish wine?

82
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:41,920
Or a girl from
the pleasure houses of Lys?

83
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:45,924
- Or you could even buy a friend.
- He's going to die.

84
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,885
Ser Loras rides well.

85
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,167
Such a shame, Littlefinger.

86
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:23,504
It would have been so nice
for you to have a friend.

87
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:25,506
And tell me, Lord Renly,

88
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:27,966
when will you be having your friend?

89
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:42,231
Loras knew his mare was in heat.
Quite crafty, really.

90
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:44,650
Ser Loras would never do that.

91
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:48,695
- There's no honour in tricks.
- No honour and quite a bit of gold.

92
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:52,950
Sword!

93
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,561
Leave him be!

94
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,710
Stop this madness
in the name of your king!

95
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,926
Let him go!

96
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,604
I owe you my life, ser.

97
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,898
I'm no ser.

98
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,131
Remove his hood.

99
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:34,343
♪ On that eve, the captive Imp

100
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,971
♪ Downwards from his horse did limp

101
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:41,141
♪ No more would he preen and primp

102
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,851
♪ In garb of red and gold ♪

103
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,603
This isn't the Kingsroad.

104
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:48,565
- You said we were riding for Winterfell.
- I did... Often and loudly.

105
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,236
Very wise.
They'll be out in droves,

106
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:54,404
looking for me in the wrong place.

107
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:57,449
Word's probably gotten
to my father by now.

108
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:00,077
He'll be offering a handsome reward.

109
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:03,372
Everyone knows
a Lannister always pays his debts.

110
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,791
Would you be so good as to untie me?

111
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:09,294
- And why would I do that?
- Why not?

112
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,756
Am I going to run?
The hill tribes would kill me for my boots.

113
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,466
Unless a shadowcat ate me first.

114
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:17,511
Shadowcats and hill tribes
are the least of your concerns.

115
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:22,349
Ah, the eastern road.

116
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,393
We're going to the Vale.

117
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:28,146
You're taking me to your sister's
to answer for my imagined crimes.

118
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:32,234
Tell me, Lady Stark,
when was the last time you saw your sister?

119
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,987
- Five years ago.
- She's changed.

120
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:39,700
She was always a bit touched, but now...
You might as well kill me here.

121
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:42,995
- I am not a murderer, Lannister.
- Neither am I.

122
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,497
I had nothing to do
with the attempt on your son's life.

123
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,416
- The dagger found...
- What sort of imbecile

124
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,209
arms an assassin with his own blade?

125
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,461
- Should I gag him?
- Why?

126
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,463
Am I starting to make sense?

127
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:56,383
Rodrik!

128
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,847
My lady, this way.

129
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:20,449
Untie me.

130
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,493
If I die, what's the point?

131
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,209
Ah!

132
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:17,130
- Rodrik?
- I'll be fine, my lady.

133
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:20,259
There's no need to bloody yourself.

134
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,637
Your first?

135
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,849
You need a woman.

136
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,101
Nothing like a woman after a fight.

137
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:33,146
I'm willing if she is.

138
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,661
Bran.

139
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,498
The Iron Islands.
Sigil - a kraken.

140
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,750
Words - "We do not sow."

141
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:55,961
- Lords?
- The Greyjoys.

142
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:59,381
Famed for their skills at archery,
navigation and lovemaking.

143
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:03,302
And failed rebellions.

144
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:09,725
Sigil - a stag,
a crowned stag now that Robert's king.

145
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:12,853
- Good.
- Words - "Ours is the fury."

146
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:15,522
- Lords - the Baratheons.
- Mm-hm.

147
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,524
The Westerlands.

148
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:19,735
- Sigil - a lion.
- Mmm.

149
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:22,863
- Words - "A Lannister always pays his debts."
- No.

150
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:26,366
A common saying,
but not their official motto.

151
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,493
Lords - the Lannisters.

152
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:31,496
- We're still on their words.
- I don't know them.

153
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,540
You do know them. Think.

154
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:36,126
"Unbowed, unbent, unbroken."

155
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,921
- That's House Martell.
- "Righteous in wrath."

156
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:42,508
- House Hornwood.
- "Family, duty, honour."

157
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:44,551
Those are Tully words -
your mother's.

158
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:48,222
- Are we playing a game?
- Family, duty, honour...

159
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:50,557
- Is that the right order?
- You know it is.

160
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,684
Family comes first?

161
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:57,064
Your mother had to leave Winterfell
to protect the family.

162
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,608
How can she protect the family

163
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,069
if she's not with her family?

164
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:05,405
Your mother sat by your bed

165
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:08,242
for three weeks while you slept.

166
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,452
And then she left!

167
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:15,207
When you were born, I was the one
who pulled you from your mother.

168
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,294
I placed you in her arms.

169
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:23,215
From that moment
until the moment she dies,

170
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:26,760
she will love you.

171
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,554
Absolutely.

172
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,724
- Fiercely.
- Why did she leave?

173
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:34,685
I still can't tell you,

174
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:37,271
- but she will be home soon.
- Do you know where she is now?

175
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:39,022
Today?

176
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,775
- No, I don't.
- Then how can you promise me

177
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,944
she'll be home soon?

178
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:49,324
Sometimes I worry
you're too smart for your own good.

179
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,870
I'll never shoot another arrow.

180
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,373
And where is that written?

181
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:59,126
- You need legs to work a bow.
- Hmm.

182
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:01,712
If the saddle Lord Tyrion
designed actually works,

183
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:04,298
you could learn
to shoot a bow from horseback.

184
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,133
Really?

185
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,678
Dothraki boys learn
when they're four years old.

186
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,805
Why shouldn't you?

187
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:28,989
Shh, keep it down.

188
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,575
You're not supposed to be
inside the castle walls.

189
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,953
I thought you were supposed to be
an important person around here.

190
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,372
Important enough for the likes of you.

191
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:40,792
You're not the only nobleman
in my life, you know.

192
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:44,379
Who, the Imp?
I'd call him half a nobleman.

193
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:46,423
Jealous?

194
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:48,300
Why should I be jealous?

195
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:51,345
Anyone with a few coppers
in his pocket can own you for the night.

196
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,515
What's a dwarf like down below?

197
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,725
I've always wondered.

198
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,937
- Might surprise you.
- Hmm?

199
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:04,191
He's good with his fingers too.
And his tongue.

200
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:07,236
Generous tipper.

201
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,030
I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.

202
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,032
You are jealous.

203
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:13,784
I'm a Greyjoy.

204
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,036
We've been lords
of the Iron Islands for 300 years.

205
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:18,956
There's not a family in Westeros
that can look down on us,

206
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,999
not even the Lannisters.

207
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:23,126
And what about the Starks?

208
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:27,381
I've been Lord Stark's ward
since I was eight years old.

209
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:30,884
A ward -
that's a nice word for it.

210
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,846
Your father rebelled
against King Robert and if he does it again...

211
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:37,140
My father fought
for the freedom of his people.

212
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:40,894
What did your father do?
Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.

213
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:43,564
You're a very serious boy.

214
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:46,817
- I'm not a boy.
- Oh, yes, you are.

215
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:51,822
A serious boy
with a serious cock.

216
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,283
I don't want to pay for it.

217
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:57,035
Then get yourself a wife.

218
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:02,583
Come on.

219
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,170
I'm not gonna hurt you.

220
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:15,846
How is your son, my lord?

221
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,724
He'll never walk again.

222
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:22,728
But his mind is sound?

223
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,689
So they say.

224
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,900
A blessing, then.

225
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:32,196
I suffered an early mutilation myself.

226
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:36,617
Some doors close forever...

227
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:40,871
others open
in most unexpected places.

228
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,790
May I?

229
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:51,256
If the wrong ears heard
what I'm about to tell you,

230
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,509
off comes my head.

231
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:56,178
And who would mourn poor Varys then?

232
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:59,932
North or South,
they sing no songs for spiders.

233
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:02,476
But there are things you must know.

234
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,938
You are the King's Hand
and the king is a fool -

235
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:10,859
your friend, I know, but a fool -
and doomed unless you save him.

236
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:13,487
I've been in the capital a month.

237
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:17,366
Why have you waited so long
to tell me this?

238
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:19,243
I didn't trust you.

239
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:21,745
So why do you trust me now?

240
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:26,667
The queen is not the only one
who has been watching you closely.

241
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:28,919
There are few men of honour
in the capital.

242
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:30,754
You are one of them.

243
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:34,800
I would like to believe I am another
strange as that may seem.

244
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:37,469
What sort of doom does the king face?

245
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:40,305
The same sort as Jon Arryn.

246
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:44,393
The tears of lys, they call it.

247
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,854
A rare and costly thing,

248
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:50,440
as clear and tasteless as water.
It leaves no trace.

249
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:01,535
Who gave it to him?

250
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:04,746
Some dear friend, no doubt.
But which one?

251
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:09,084
There were many.
Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man.

252
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,336
There was one boy.

253
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,006
All he was he owed to Jon Arryn.

254
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,092
The squire, Ser Hugh?

255
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,096
Pity, what happened to him,

256
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:24,349
just when his life seemed to be
going so nicely.

257
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:28,562
If Ser Hugh poisoned him...

258
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,107
who paid Ser Hugh?

259
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:37,571
- Someone who could afford it.
- Jon was a man of peace.

260
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:41,158
He was Hand for 17 years -
17 good years.

261
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:43,160
Why kill him?

262
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:47,372
He started asking questions.

263
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:18,695
He's found
one bastard already.

264
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:20,989
He has the book.

265
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,033
The rest will come.

266
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,452
And when he knows the truth,
what will he do?

267
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:27,287
The gods alone know.

268
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:30,415
The fools tried to kill his son.

269
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,252
What's worse -
they botched it.

270
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:38,465
The wolf and the lion
will be at each other's throats.

271
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:42,344
- We will be at war soon, my friend.
- What good is war now?

272
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:44,471
We're not ready.

273
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:47,182
If one Hand can die,
why not a second?

274
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:49,893
This Hand is not the other.

275
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:51,520
We need time.

276
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:54,815
Khal Drogo will not make his move
until his son is born.

277
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,318
- You know what these savages are.
- "Delay," you say.

278
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:00,404
"Move fast," I reply.

279
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:03,782
This is no longer
a game for two players.

280
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:05,951
It never was.

281
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:28,515
The first to arrive
and the last to leave.

282
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:32,186
I admire your industry.

283
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:34,897
You do move quietly.

284
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:37,524
We all have our qualities.

285
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:40,527
You look a bit lonely today.

286
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:43,030
You should pay a visit
to my brothel this evening.

287
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:45,574
- First boy is on the house.
- I think you're mistaking

288
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:48,577
- business with pleasure.
- Am I?

289
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:54,374
All those birds that whisper in your ear -
such pretty little things.

290
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,920
Trust me,

291
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:00,672
we accommodate all inclinations.

292
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:05,802
Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne
likes his boys very young, I hear.

293
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:10,724
I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion -
both equally important.

294
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:15,521
Though I suppose beauty
is a subjective quality, no?

295
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:20,067
Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone
prefers amputees?

296
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:22,903
All desires are valid
to a man with a full purse.

297
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:26,448
And I heard the most awful rumour
about a certain lord

298
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:28,575
with a taste for fresh cadavers.

299
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:32,871
Must be enormously difficult
to accommodate that inclination.

300
00:23:32,955 --> 00:23:34,915
The logistics alone...

301
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:38,293
to find beautiful corpses
before they rot.

302
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:42,506
Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be
in accordance with the king's laws.

303
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:45,008
Strictly speaking.

304
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:52,724
Tell me. Does someone somewhere
keep your balls in a little box?

305
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:56,270
I've often wondered.

306
00:23:57,771 --> 00:23:59,481
Do you know,
I have no idea where they are.

307
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:03,318
And we had been so close.

308
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:05,112
But enough about me.
How have you been

309
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:07,322
since we last saw each other?

310
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:09,950
Since you last saw me
or since I last saw you?

311
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:13,453
Now the last time I saw you,
you were talking to the Hand of the King.

312
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:16,331
- Saw me with your own eyes?
- Eyes I own.

313
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:17,958
Council business.

314
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:21,086
We all have so much
to discuss with Ned Stark.

315
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:26,175
Everyone's well aware of
your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife.

316
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:30,721
If the Lannisters were behind the attempt
on the Stark boy's life

317
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:36,143
and it was discovered that you helped
the Starks come to that conclusion...

318
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:39,271
to think a simple word to the queen...

319
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:41,690
- One shudders at the thought.
- Ooh.

320
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:44,234
But you know something?
I do believe that I have seen you

321
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:46,278
even more recently
than you have seen me.

322
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:49,156
- Have you?
- Yes.

323
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,991
Earlier today, I distinctly recall

324
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:53,535
seeing you talking
to Lord Stark in his chambers.

325
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,787
Was that you under the bed?

326
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:57,831
And not long after that

327
00:24:57,915 --> 00:25:00,584
when I saw you escorting a certain

328
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,754
foreign dignitary...

329
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:06,215
Council business?

330
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,551
Of course, you would have friends
from across the Narrow Sea.

331
00:25:09,635 --> 00:25:12,221
You're from there yourself, after all.

332
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:15,516
We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys?

333
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:17,851
I'd like to think we are.

334
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:20,145
So you can imagine my burden,

335
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,941
wondering if the king
might question my friend's sympathies.

336
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:28,028
To stand at a crossroads
where turning left means loyalty to a friend,

337
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,947
turning right loyalty to the realm...

338
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:32,366
- Oh, please.
- To find myself in a position

339
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:34,409
where a simple word to the king...

340
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:36,662
What are you two conspiring about?

341
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:40,082
Well, whatever it is,
you'd best hurry up.

342
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:43,210
- My brother is coming.
- To a small council meeting?

343
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:46,213
Disturbing news from far away.

344
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:49,883
Hadn't you heard?

345
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:20,914
Off with you. No begging.

346
00:26:20,998 --> 00:26:22,916
I'm not a beggar.
I live here.

347
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,200
D'you want a smack on your ear
to help you with your hearing?

348
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,129
I want to see my father.

349
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:29,965
I want to fuck the queen,
for all the good it does me.

350
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,800
You want your father, boy?

351
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:36,013
He's lying on the floor of some tavern,
getting pissed on by his friends.

352
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:38,557
My father is Hand of the King!

353
00:26:38,724 --> 00:26:41,226
I'm not a boy.
I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell.

354
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:44,730
And if you lay a hand on me, my father
will have both your heads on spikes.

355
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:47,816
Now are you going to let me by
or do I need to smack you

356
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,402
on the ear to help with your hearing?

357
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:55,073
You know I had half my guard
out searching for you?

358
00:26:58,327 --> 00:27:01,788
- You promised me this would stop.
- They said they were going to kill you.

359
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:04,541
- Who did?
- I didn't see them,

360
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:06,460
- but I think one was fat.
- Oh, Arya.

361
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:09,213
I'm not lying!
They said you found the bastard

362
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:12,216
and the wolves are fighting
the lions and the savage...

363
00:27:12,341 --> 00:27:14,051
Something about the savage.

364
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:16,470
- Where did you hear this?
- In the dungeons,

365
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:19,806
- near the dragon skulls.
- What were you doing in the dungeons?

366
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:23,018
Chasing a cat.

367
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:26,855
Pardon, my lord.

368
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:30,234
There's a night's watchman here
begging a word. Says it's urgent.

369
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:40,160
- Your name, friend?
- Yoren, if it please.

370
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:44,331
- This must be your son. He has the look.
- I'm a girl!

371
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:46,041
Did Benjen send you?

372
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:50,170
No one sent me, my lord.
I'm here to find men for the Wall

373
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:53,841
see if there's any scum in the dungeons
that might be fit for service.

374
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:56,552
- Oh, we'll find recruits for you.
- Thank you, my lord.

375
00:27:56,677 --> 00:27:59,012
But that's not why I disturb you now.

376
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:03,141
Your brother Benjen,
his blood runs black -

377
00:28:03,225 --> 00:28:05,310
makes him as much
my brother as yours.

378
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,816
It's for his sake I rode here so hard
I damn near killed my horse.

379
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:12,609
There are others riding too.

380
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:15,237
The whole city will know by tomorrow.

381
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:17,698
Know what?

382
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:20,367
Best said in private, my lord.

383
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:29,042
Go on. We'll talk more later.

384
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:32,129
Jory, take her safely to her room.

385
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:34,673
Come along, my lady.
You heard your father.

386
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:45,475
- How many guards does my father have?
- Here in King's Landing? Fifty.

387
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:48,187
You wouldn't let anyone
kill him, would you?

388
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:51,023
No fear on that count, little lady.

389
00:28:55,736 --> 00:28:59,114
- Well?
- It's about your wife, my lord.

390
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:03,243
She's taken the Imp.

391
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:21,303
You're far from home, Lady Stark.

392
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:25,933
- To whom do I speak?
- Ser Vardis Egan, knight of the Vale.

393
00:29:26,058 --> 00:29:30,229
- Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?
- There was no time to send word.

394
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:32,523
May I ask, my lady,

395
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:34,441
why he is with you?

396
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:37,194
That's why there was no time.

397
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:39,947
- He is my prisoner.
- He doesn't look like a prisoner.

398
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:43,283
My sister will decide what he looks like.

399
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:47,037
Yes, my lady.
She will at that.

400
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:56,505
The Eyrie.
They say it's impregnable.

401
00:29:57,798 --> 00:30:00,259
Give me ten good men
and some climbing spikes,

402
00:30:00,384 --> 00:30:02,594
I'll impregnate the bitch.

403
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:05,430
I like you.

404
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:17,276
Lord Stark, your presence
has been requested

405
00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:19,695
in the small council chamber.
A meeting has been called.

406
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:21,905
I need to see the king first - alone.

407
00:30:21,947 --> 00:30:24,283
The king is at
the small council meeting, my lord.

408
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:26,368
He has summoned you.

409
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:29,371
- Is it about my wife?
- No, my lord.

410
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:32,124
I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.

411
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:36,545
- The whore is pregnant.
- You're speaking of murdering a child.

412
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,047
I warned you this would happen,
back in the North.

413
00:30:39,131 --> 00:30:41,800
I warned you, but you didn't care to hear.

414
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:44,136
Well, hear it now.

415
00:30:45,095 --> 00:30:47,723
I want 'em dead,
mother and child both.

416
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:49,892
And that fool Viserys as well.

417
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:53,395
Is that plain enough for you?
I want them both dead.

418
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:56,023
You will dishonour yourself
forever if you do this.

419
00:30:56,106 --> 00:30:59,735
Honour?!
I've got seven kingdoms to rule!

420
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,946
One king, seven kingdoms.

421
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,282
Do you think honour keeps them in line?

422
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:07,534
Do you think it's honour
that's keeping the peace?

423
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:12,039
- It's fear - fear and blood.
- Then we're no better than the Mad King.

424
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:16,418
- Careful, Ned. Careful now.
- You want to assassinate a girl

425
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:18,086
because the spider heard a rumour?

426
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:21,006
No rumour, my lord.
The princess is with child.

427
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:24,426
- Based on whose information?
- Ser Jorah Mormont.

428
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,762
He is serving as advisor
to the Targaryens.

429
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:29,264
Mormont?
You bring us the whispers

430
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:32,976
of a traitor half a world away
and call it fact?

431
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,771
Jorah Mormont's a slaver
not a traitor.

432
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:38,232
Small difference, I know,
to an honourable man.

433
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:42,027
He broke the law,
betrayed his family, fled our land.

434
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:44,154
We commit murder
on the word of this man?

435
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:47,908
And if he's right?
If she has a son?

436
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:51,286
A Targaryen at the head
of a Dothraki army -

437
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:55,249
- what then?
- The Narrow Sea still lies between us.

438
00:31:55,374 --> 00:31:59,503
I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach
their horses to run on water.

439
00:31:59,628 --> 00:32:01,547
Do nothing?

440
00:32:01,672 --> 00:32:03,966
That's your wise advice?

441
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:07,636
Do nothing till our enemies
are on our shores?

442
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:09,847
You're my council.
Counsel!

443
00:32:09,972 --> 00:32:13,642
Speak sense to this honourable fool.

444
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:17,646
I understand your misgivings, my lord.

445
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:20,315
Truly, I do.
It is a terrible thing

446
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,442
we must consider, a vile thing.

447
00:32:22,568 --> 00:32:24,820
Yet we who presume to rule

448
00:32:24,903 --> 00:32:26,989
must sometimes do vile things

449
00:32:27,072 --> 00:32:29,324
for the good of the realm.

450
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:32,786
Should the gods
grant Daenerys a son,

451
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:36,748
- the realm will bleed.
- I bear this girl no ill will,

452
00:32:36,874 --> 00:32:40,669
but should the Dothraki invade,
how many innocents will die?

453
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:43,130
How many towns will burn?

454
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:46,466
Is it not wiser, kinder even,

455
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:51,805
that she should die now
so that tens of thousands might live?

456
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,474
We should have had them
both killed years ago.

457
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,852
When you find yourself
in bed with an ugly woman,

458
00:32:56,977 --> 00:33:00,230
best close your eyes,
get it over with.

459
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:03,442
Cut her throat.
Be done with it.

460
00:33:09,907 --> 00:33:12,492
I followed you into war -

461
00:33:12,618 --> 00:33:14,620
twice,

462
00:33:14,745 --> 00:33:16,538
without doubts,

463
00:33:16,705 --> 00:33:18,707
without second thoughts.

464
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:21,585
But I will not follow you now.

465
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:24,588
The Robert I grew up with

466
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:28,175
didn't tremble at the shadow
of an unborn child.

467
00:33:30,219 --> 00:33:32,054
She dies.

468
00:33:33,472 --> 00:33:35,390
I will have no part in it.

469
00:33:35,516 --> 00:33:37,684
You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark.

470
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:41,313
You'll do as I command
or I'll find me a Hand who will.

471
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:52,491
And good luck to him.

472
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:56,370
- I thought you were a better man.
- Out. Out, damn you.

473
00:33:56,453 --> 00:33:58,163
I'm done with you.

474
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:02,334
Go, run back to Winterfell!

475
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:04,753
I'll have your head on a spike!

476
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:09,091
I'll put it there myself, you fool!

477
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:11,093
You think you're too good for this?

478
00:34:11,218 --> 00:34:14,137
Too proud and honourable?
This is a war!

479
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:20,102
I'll go ahead with my daughters.
Get them ready. Do it yourself.

480
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:23,021
- Don't ask anyone for help.
- Right away, my lord.

481
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:25,649
Lord Baelish is here for you.

482
00:34:26,984 --> 00:34:29,361
His Grace went on about you
at some length

483
00:34:29,486 --> 00:34:33,323
after you took your leave.
The word "treason" was mentioned.

484
00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:38,203
- What can I do for you?
- When do you return to Winterfell?

485
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:41,206
- Why? What do you care?
- If you're still here come nightfall,

486
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:45,002
I'll take you to see the last person
Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill.

487
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:47,588
If that sort of thing still interests you.

488
00:34:48,547 --> 00:34:50,299
I don't have the time.

489
00:34:50,382 --> 00:34:53,468
It won't take more than an hour.
But as you please.

490
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:02,102
Round up all the men we have
and station them outside the girls' chambers.

491
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:05,689
- Who are your best two swords?
- Heward and Wyl.

492
00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:08,901
Find them and meet me at the stables.

493
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,366
You bring him here without permission?

494
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,286
You pollute my home with his presence?

495
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:26,752
Your aunt has done a bad thing,
Robin, a very bad thing.

496
00:35:26,835 --> 00:35:28,378
You remember her, don't you?

497
00:35:29,922 --> 00:35:31,757
Isn't he beautiful?

498
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:34,885
And strong too. Jon knew it.

499
00:35:34,927 --> 00:35:37,846
His last words were
"The seed is strong."

500
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,432
He wanted everyone to know
what a good, strong boy

501
00:35:40,557 --> 00:35:43,060
his son would grow up to be.

502
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:46,313
Look at him,
the lord of all the Vale.

503
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:48,649
Lysa,

504
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:51,193
you wrote me about the Lannisters,

505
00:35:51,276 --> 00:35:54,321
- warning me...
- To stay away from them!

506
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:56,990
Not to bring one here!

507
00:35:57,157 --> 00:35:59,409
Mummy...

508
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:02,538
- is that the bad man?
- It is.

509
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:06,917
He's little.

510
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:09,253
He's Tyrion the Imp,
of House Lannister.

511
00:36:10,504 --> 00:36:13,298
He killed your father.
He murdered the Hand of the King!

512
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:15,884
Oh, did I kill him too?

513
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:20,097
- I've been a very busy man.
- You will watch your tongue!

514
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:23,016
These men are knights of the Vale.

515
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:25,811
Every one of them loved Jon Arryn.

516
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:27,813
Every one of them would die for me.

517
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:31,400
If any harm comes to me,
my brother Jaime will see that they do.

518
00:36:31,525 --> 00:36:34,403
You can't hurt us.
No one can hurt us here. Tell him, Mummy!

519
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:38,323
- Tell him!
- Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh, my sweet boy.

520
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:42,870
He's just trying to frighten us.
Lannisters are all liars.

521
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:45,706
No one will hurt my baby.

522
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:47,499
Mummy...

523
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:51,044
I want to see the bad man fly.

524
00:36:53,088 --> 00:36:56,425
- Perhaps you will, my little love.
- This man is my prisoner.

525
00:36:57,134 --> 00:37:00,012
I will not have him harmed.

526
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:03,140
Ser Vardis,

527
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:06,018
my sister's guest is weary.

528
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:08,729
Take him down below
so he can rest.

529
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,730
Introduce him to Mord.

530
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:16,653
You go sleep, dwarf man.

531
00:37:16,737 --> 00:37:18,822
Sleep good, little dwarf man!

532
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:56,944
Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.

533
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,738
Robert will rant for a few days,
but he won't do anything.

534
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:02,950
- He adores the man.
- You're jealous.

535
00:38:04,034 --> 00:38:06,662
- Are you sure this won't hurt?
- Only if I slip.

536
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:14,086
- And you'd prefer me like this?
- Mm-hm.

537
00:38:14,169 --> 00:38:16,672
If you want hairless,
maybe you should find a little boy.

538
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:18,799
I want you.

539
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,970
My brother thinks that anyone
who hasn't been to war isn't a man.

540
00:38:23,095 --> 00:38:25,514
He treats me as if I'm a spoilt child.

541
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:28,767
Oh, and you're not?

542
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:32,020
Loras Tyrell,
the Knight of the Flowers?

543
00:38:32,145 --> 00:38:34,314
How many wars have you fought in?

544
00:38:34,356 --> 00:38:37,693
Oh, and how much did your father spend
on that armour of yours?

545
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:39,653
Hold still.

546
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:43,699
All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis
is how I'm not tough enough,

547
00:38:43,782 --> 00:38:45,576
how I squirm at the sight of blood.

548
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:48,328
You did vomit when that boy's eye
was knocked out in the melee.

549
00:38:48,412 --> 00:38:50,372
His eye was dangling
out of the damn socket!

550
00:38:50,455 --> 00:38:53,095
He shouldn't have entered the melee
if he didn't know how to fight.

551
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:56,336
Easy for you to say.
Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.

552
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:58,922
It's not a gift.
No one gave it to me.

553
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:00,883
I'm good because I work at it -

554
00:39:00,966 --> 00:39:03,760
every day of my life
since I could hold a stick.

555
00:39:04,178 --> 00:39:07,931
I could work at fighting all day, every day,
I'd still never be as good as you.

556
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:10,434
Yes, well, I guess we'll never know.

557
00:39:20,485 --> 00:39:22,946
- Everywhere?
- Everywhere.

558
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:25,365
So how did it end up?

559
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:30,537
- The Targaryen girl will die?
- It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is.

560
00:39:30,621 --> 00:39:32,664
Robert's rather tasteless about it.

561
00:39:32,748 --> 00:39:36,293
Every time he talks about killing her,
I swear the table rises six inches.

562
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:39,254
It's a shame he can't muster
the same enthusiasm for his wife.

563
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:41,715
He does have a deep,
abiding lust for her money.

564
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:44,259
You have to give it
to the Lannisters - they may be

565
00:39:44,343 --> 00:39:47,638
the most pompous, ponderous cunts
the gods ever suffered to walk the world,

566
00:39:47,763 --> 00:39:50,390
but they do have
outrageous amounts of money.

567
00:39:51,725 --> 00:39:55,646
- I have an outrageous amount of money.
- Not as much as the Lannisters.

568
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:59,191
But a lot more than you.

569
00:39:59,775 --> 00:40:02,569
Robert's threatening
to take me hunting with him.

570
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:04,696
Last time we were out there
for two weeks.

571
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:07,241
Tramping through the trees
in the rain, day after day,

572
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:10,410
all so he can stick his spear
into something's flesh.

573
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:13,914
Oh. But Robert loves his killing.

574
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:15,958
- And he's the king.
- Hmm.

575
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:19,586
- How did that ever happen?
- Because he loves his killing.

576
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,713
And he used to be good at it.

577
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:25,092
Do you know who should be king?

578
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:27,469
- Be serious.
- I am.

579
00:40:27,553 --> 00:40:29,721
My father could be your bank.

580
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:31,765
I've never fought in a war before,

581
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:34,643
- but I'd fight for you.
- I'm fourth in line.

582
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:37,771
And where's Robert
in the line of royal succession?

583
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:40,107
Joffrey is a monster.
Tommen is eight.

584
00:40:40,274 --> 00:40:42,734
- Stannis?
- Stannis has the personality of a lobster.

585
00:40:42,943 --> 00:40:45,028
He's still my older brother.

586
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:47,573
- What are you doing?!
- Look at it.

587
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:49,898
- You cut me.
- It's just blood. We've all got it in us.

588
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:52,244
Sometimes a little spills.

589
00:40:52,828 --> 00:40:55,539
If you become king,
you're going to see a lot of this.

590
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:57,833
You need to get used to it.

591
00:40:57,958 --> 00:40:59,918
Go on. Look.

592
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,089
People love you.

593
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:07,593
They love to serve you
because you're kind to them.

594
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:10,179
They want to be near you.

595
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:15,225
You're willing to do
what needs to be done,

596
00:41:16,268 --> 00:41:18,520
but you don't gloat over it.

597
00:41:18,604 --> 00:41:20,397
You don't love killing.

598
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:28,113
Where is it written that power
is the sole province of the worst?

599
00:41:28,947 --> 00:41:33,035
That thrones are only made
for the hated and the feared?

600
00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:38,540
You would be a wonderful king.

601
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:59,728
I'm sorry your marriage
to Ned Stark didn't work out.

602
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:01,438
You seemed so good together.

603
00:42:01,563 --> 00:42:04,858
I'm glad I could do something
to make you happy.

604
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:10,822
Without a Hand,
everything will fall to pieces.

605
00:42:10,948 --> 00:42:15,619
I suppose this is where you tell me
to give the job to your brother Jaime.

606
00:42:15,744 --> 00:42:17,120
No.

607
00:42:17,287 --> 00:42:19,289
He's not serious enough.

608
00:42:20,374 --> 00:42:23,377
I'll say this for Ned Stark -
he's serious enough.

609
00:42:23,544 --> 00:42:24,586
Hmm.

610
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:28,298
Was it really worth it?
Losing him this way?

611
00:42:28,382 --> 00:42:30,259
I don't know.

612
00:42:32,845 --> 00:42:34,513
But I do know this -

613
00:42:35,514 --> 00:42:40,769
if the Targaryen girl convinces
her horselord husband to invade

614
00:42:40,894 --> 00:42:44,147
and the Dothraki horde
crosses the Narrow Sea...

615
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:47,943
we won't be able to stop them.

616
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:50,404
The Dothraki don't sail.
Every child knows that.

617
00:42:50,487 --> 00:42:53,740
They don't have discipline.
They don't have armour.

618
00:42:53,866 --> 00:42:57,327
- They don't have siege weapons.
- It's a neat little trick you do -

619
00:42:57,452 --> 00:43:00,455
you move your lips
and your father's voice comes out.

620
00:43:00,581 --> 00:43:03,584
Is my father wrong?

621
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:09,965
Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands

622
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:13,677
with 40,000 Dothraki screamers at his back.

623
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,138
We hole up in our castles.

624
00:43:16,263 --> 00:43:17,973
A wise move -

625
00:43:18,056 --> 00:43:21,727
only a fool would meet
the Dothraki in an open field.

626
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:24,688
They leave us in our castles.

627
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:28,275
They go from town to town,
looting and burning,

628
00:43:28,358 --> 00:43:32,154
killing every man
who can't hide behind a stone wall

629
00:43:32,321 --> 00:43:34,740
stealing all our crops and livestock,

630
00:43:34,907 --> 00:43:37,784
enslaving all our women and children.

631
00:43:37,868 --> 00:43:40,329
How long do the people
of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind

632
00:43:40,412 --> 00:43:43,665
their absentee king,
their cowardly king

633
00:43:43,832 --> 00:43:46,210
hiding behind high walls?

634
00:43:46,376 --> 00:43:49,171
When do the people decide
that Viserys Targaryen

635
00:43:49,254 --> 00:43:51,673
is the rightful monarch after all?

636
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,469
We still outnumber them.

637
00:43:56,845 --> 00:44:00,140
Which is the bigger number -
five or one?

638
00:44:01,558 --> 00:44:02,643
Five.

639
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:05,521
Five...

640
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:09,441
One.

641
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:11,735
One army - a real army

642
00:44:11,818 --> 00:44:15,697
united behind one leader
with one purpose.

643
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:21,495
Our purpose died with the Mad King.

644
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:23,747
Now we've got as many armies

645
00:44:24,289 --> 00:44:27,751
as there are men
with gold in their purse.

646
00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:29,837
And everybody wants
something different.

647
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,130
Your father wants to own the world.

648
00:44:32,297 --> 00:44:35,551
Ned Stark wants to run away
and bury his head in the snow.

649
00:44:35,634 --> 00:44:37,678
What do you want?

650
00:44:47,646 --> 00:44:51,316
We haven't had
a real fight in nine years.

651
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,527
Backstabbing doesn't prepare you
for a fight.

652
00:44:53,652 --> 00:44:55,696
And that's all the realm is now -

653
00:44:55,821 --> 00:44:57,906
backstabbing and scheming

654
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:01,034
and arse-licking
and money-grubbing.

655
00:45:02,035 --> 00:45:04,830
Sometimes I don't know
what holds it together.

656
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:08,959
Our marriage.

657
00:45:17,217 --> 00:45:19,720
Ah, so here we sit,

658
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:24,558
17 years later,
holding it all together.

659
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:28,145
Don't you get tired?

660
00:45:28,729 --> 00:45:30,731
Every day.

661
00:45:31,982 --> 00:45:34,943
How long can hate
hold a thing together?

662
00:45:35,027 --> 00:45:39,031
Well, 17 years is quite a long time.

663
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:41,700
Yes, it is.

664
00:45:42,326 --> 00:45:44,036
Yes, it is.

665
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:52,002
What was she like?

666
00:45:54,004 --> 00:45:56,215
You've never asked
about her, not once.

667
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,799
Why not?

668
00:45:58,759 --> 00:46:02,471
At first, just saying her name
even in private

669
00:46:02,596 --> 00:46:05,766
felt like I was breathing life
back into her.

670
00:46:06,517 --> 00:46:10,646
I thought if I didn't talk about her,
she'd just fade away for you.

671
00:46:10,771 --> 00:46:13,607
When I realised
that wasn't going to happen,

672
00:46:13,732 --> 00:46:15,776
I refused to ask out of spite.

673
00:46:16,693 --> 00:46:21,406
I didn't want to give you the satisfaction
of thinking I cared enough to ask.

674
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:24,826
And eventually it became clear
that my spite didn't mean anything to you.

675
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:27,829
As far as I could tell
you actually enjoyed it.

676
00:46:28,205 --> 00:46:29,873
So why now?

677
00:46:31,667 --> 00:46:36,004
What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost
do to either of us

678
00:46:36,088 --> 00:46:39,258
that we haven't done to each other
a hundred times over?

679
00:46:42,803 --> 00:46:45,138
You want to know the horrible truth?

680
00:46:48,308 --> 00:46:50,394
I can't even remember
what she looked like.

681
00:46:53,939 --> 00:46:58,652
I only know she was
the one thing I ever wanted.

682
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:03,156
Someone took her away from me,

683
00:47:04,491 --> 00:47:08,579
and seven kingdoms
couldn't fill the hole she left behind.

684
00:47:12,624 --> 00:47:15,002
I felt something
for you once, you know?

685
00:47:16,295 --> 00:47:18,088
I know.

686
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:21,008
Even after we lost our first boy.

687
00:47:23,093 --> 00:47:24,845
For quite a while, actually.

688
00:47:29,266 --> 00:47:33,604
Was it ever possible for us?
Was there ever a time, ever a moment?

689
00:47:41,028 --> 00:47:42,029
No.

690
00:47:46,491 --> 00:47:49,536
Does that make you feel better or worse?

691
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:56,335
It doesn't make me feel anything.

692
00:48:10,891 --> 00:48:12,809
She looks like him,

693
00:48:12,935 --> 00:48:14,853
don't she, my lord?

694
00:48:14,978 --> 00:48:17,898
She has his nose,
his black hair.

695
00:48:18,857 --> 00:48:20,442
Aye.

696
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:22,528
Tell him when you see him, my lord.

697
00:48:22,653 --> 00:48:26,907
If it please you,
tell him how beautiful she is.

698
00:48:28,617 --> 00:48:32,204
- I will.
- And tell him I've been with no one else.

699
00:48:32,287 --> 00:48:35,749
I swear it, my lord,
by the old gods and new.

700
00:48:35,874 --> 00:48:37,960
I don't want no jewels or nothing,

701
00:48:38,085 --> 00:48:39,795
just him.

702
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,505
The king was always good to me.

703
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:43,757
When Jon Arryn came to visit you,

704
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:48,011
- what did he want?
- He wasn't that sort of man, my lord.

705
00:48:48,136 --> 00:48:50,931
He just wanted to know
if the child was happy,

706
00:48:51,056 --> 00:48:53,058
healthy.

707
00:48:55,853 --> 00:48:57,896
Looks healthy enough to me.

708
00:48:59,773 --> 00:49:01,942
The girl shall want for nothing.

709
00:49:08,031 --> 00:49:10,450
Brothels make a much better
investment than ships,

710
00:49:10,534 --> 00:49:12,202
I've found.

711
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:14,621
Whores rarely sink.

712
00:49:19,168 --> 00:49:21,753
What do you know
of King Robert's bastards?

713
00:49:21,837 --> 00:49:25,340
Well, he has more than you, for a start.

714
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:28,010
- How many?
- Does it matter?

715
00:49:28,093 --> 00:49:30,971
If you fuck enough women,
some of them will give you presents.

716
00:49:31,096 --> 00:49:33,015
And Jon Arryn
tracked them all down. Why?

717
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:36,018
He was the King's Hand.
Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after.

718
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:39,313
He was overcome with fatherly love.

719
00:49:42,316 --> 00:49:43,817
Come.

720
00:49:50,157 --> 00:49:52,201
- Jory!
- My lord.

721
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:13,263
Such a small pack of wolves.

722
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:17,184
Stay back, ser.
This is the Hand of the King.

723
00:50:17,267 --> 00:50:19,228
Was the Hand of the King.

724
00:50:19,353 --> 00:50:23,273
Now I'm not sure what he is -
Lord of somewhere very far away.

725
00:50:23,732 --> 00:50:25,567
What's the meaning of this, Lannister?

726
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:29,905
Get back inside where it's safe.
I'm looking for my brother.

727
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,813
You remember my brother,
don't you, Lord Stark?

728
00:50:31,823 --> 00:50:35,953
Blond hair,
sharp tongue, short man.

729
00:50:36,787 --> 00:50:40,249
- I remember him well.
- It seems he had some trouble on the road.

730
00:50:40,374 --> 00:50:43,168
You wouldn't know
what happened to him, would you?

731
00:50:43,252 --> 00:50:47,631
He was taken at my command
to answer for his crimes.

732
00:50:47,714 --> 00:50:50,259
My lords!

733
00:50:50,384 --> 00:50:52,886
I'll bring the City Watch.

734
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:58,308
Come, Stark.
I'd rather you die sword in hand.

735
00:50:58,433 --> 00:51:00,394
- If you threaten my lord again...
- Threaten?

736
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:03,438
As in, "I'm going to open your lord

737
00:51:03,564 --> 00:51:07,150
"from balls to brains
and see what Starks are made of'?

738
00:51:07,609 --> 00:51:10,112
You kill me,

739
00:51:10,237 --> 00:51:12,698
your brother's a dead man.

740
00:51:12,823 --> 00:51:14,575
You're right.

741
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,369
Take him alive. Kill his men.

742
00:52:25,854 --> 00:52:27,648
Yah!

743
00:52:52,506 --> 00:52:56,134
My brother, Lord Stark -
we want him back.

744
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:13,061
JORY'S SCENE IN THE BROTHEL REALLY CRACKS ME UP.
Sync, corrected & Dothraki dialogue by <font color="#3333FF">MALAY DEV</font>

3
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,940
Your pardon, Your Grace.

4
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,317
I would rise, but...

5
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:33,445
Do you know what your wife has done?

6
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,908
- She did nothing I did not command.
- Who'd have thought she had it in her?

7
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,702
By what right dare you lay hands
on my blood?

8
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,664
- I am the King's Hand...
- You were the King's Hand!

9
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,582
You shall now be held accountable.

10
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,669
Oh, will both of you shut your mouths?

11
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:53,340
Catelyn will release Tyrion
and you'll make your peace with Jaime.

12
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,634
He butchered my men.

13
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,680
Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel
when his men attacked Jaime.

14
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:03,267
- Quiet, woman.
- Jaime has fled the city.

15
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,103
Give me leave to bring him back to justice.

16
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,982
I took you for a king.

17
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:11,441
Hold your tongue.

18
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,528
He's attacked one of my brothers
and abducted the other.

19
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:17,948
I should wear the armour
and you the gown.

20
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,961
I shall wear this like a badge of honour.

21
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:37,342
Wear it in silence or I'll honour you again.

22
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,609
See what she does to me?

23
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,570
My loving wife.

24
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,703
I should not have hit her.

25
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,747
That was not...

26
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,083
That was not kingly.

27
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,420
If we don't act...

28
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,882
there will be a war.

29
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:23,222
So tell your wife to return
that little shit of an Imp to King's Landing.

30
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:25,891
She's had her fun, now put an end to it.

31
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:30,270
You hear me?
Send a raven and put an end to it.

32
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,981
And what about Jaime Lannister?

33
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:36,902
What about Jaime?

34
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:40,822
I'm half a kingdom in debt
to his bloody father.

35
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:44,743
I don't know what happened
between you and those yellow-haired shits.

36
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,538
I don't want to know.
This is what matters -

37
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:51,250
I can't rule the Kingdoms
if the Starks and the Lannisters

38
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,878
are at each other's throats, so enough.

39
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,257
As you command, Your Grace.

40
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:01,051
With your leave...

41
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:04,847
I will return to Winterfell
and set matters straight.

42
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:08,517
Piss on that. Send a raven.
I want you to stay.

43
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,936
I'm the king. I get what I want.

44
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,944
I never loved my brothers.

45
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,490
A sad thing for a man to admit, but it's true.

46
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,371
You were the brother I chose.

47
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,213
We'll talk when I return from the hunt.

48
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,176
The hunt?

49
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,679
Killing things clears my head.

50
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:49,057
You'll have to sit on the throne
while I'm away.

51
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,143
You'll hate it more than I do.

52
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,979
- The Targaryen girl...
- Seven hells!

53
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,939
Don't start with her again!

54
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,443
The girl will die and I'll hear no more of it.

55
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,529
Put on the badge.
And if you ever take it off again,

56
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:06,575
I swear to the mother I'll pin the damned thing
on Jaime Lannister.

57
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,117
Khaleesi?

58
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:34,496
Oh, Khaleesi!

59
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,426
You're hurt.

60
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:44,399
- Not too fast.
- Come on, Dancer.

61
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,276
When are you gonna tell him?

62
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,445
Not now.

63
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,197
- Blood for blood.
- Come on!

64
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:52,908
You need to make the Lannisters pay
for Jory and the others.

65
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:56,495
- You're talking about war.
- I'm talking about justice.

66
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,446
Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in
the bannermen and raise an army.

67
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,167
A Lannister put his spear
through your father's leg.

68
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,785
The Kingslayer rides for Casterly Rock
where no one can touch him...

69
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,672
You want me to march on Casterly Rock?

70
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,924
- You're not a boy anymore.
- Come on.

71
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,927
They attacked your father.
They've already started the war.

72
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:16,181
It's your duty to represent your House
when your father can't.

73
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:19,685
And it's not your duty,
because it's not your House.

74
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,489
Where's Bran?

75
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,201
I don't know.

76
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,161
It's not my House.

77
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:11,653
Robb?

78
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:15,449
All alone in the deep, dark woods.

79
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,621
I'm not alone.
My brother is with me.

80
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,331
I don't see him.

81
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,333
Got him hidden under your cloak?

82
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,627
Ooh, that's a pretty pin.

83
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,337
Silver.

84
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:32,424
We'll take the pin and the horse.
Get down.

85
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:35,552
Be quick about it.

86
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:36,970
I can't.

87
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,056
The saddle... The straps.

88
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:45,687
What's wrong with you?
You some kind of cripple?

89
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,481
I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.

90
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:50,025
If you don't let me be, I'll have you all killed!

91
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,986
Cut his little cock off
and stuff it in his mouth.

92
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,655
The boy's worth nothing dead.

93
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,074
Benjen Stark's own blood?

94
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:00,369
Think what Mance would give us.

95
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:03,789
Piss on Mance Rayder
and piss on the North.

96
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,959
We're going as far south as south goes.

97
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:10,462
There ain't no white walkers down in Dorne.

98
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,047
Drop the knife!

99
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:15,092
Let him go and I'll let you live.

100
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,823
Robb.

101
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,617
- Robb.
- Shut up.

102
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,120
Drop the blade!

103
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:45,163
- No, don't.
- Do it.

104
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,746
Are you all right?

105
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,290
Yes. It doesn't hurt.

106
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,792
Tough little lad.

107
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:35,631
In the Iron Islands, you're not a man
until you've killed your first enemy.

108
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,841
Well done.

109
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,426
Have you lost your mind?

110
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:41,261
What if you'd missed?

111
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,805
He would have killed you
and cut Bran's throat.

112
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:46,350
- You don't have the right...
- To save your brother's life?

113
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:49,144
It was the only thing to do, so I did it.

114
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:52,898
What about her?

115
00:12:58,362 --> 00:13:01,740
Give me my life, my lord,
and I'm yours.

116
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:05,577
We'll keep her alive.

117
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,228
Mord!

118
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:34,481
Turnkey! Mord!

119
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,943
Mord!

120
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:43,866
Dwarf man making noise!

121
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:48,328
How would you like to be rich?

122
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:50,622
Dwarf man still making noise.

123
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,250
My family is rich.

124
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,210
We have gold, lots of gold.

125
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,504
I'm prepared to give you lots of gold in...

126
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,217
No gold!

127
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,303
Well, I don't have it here.

128
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:06,638
No gold!

129
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,390
Fuck off.

130
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,585
I don't want to practice today.

131
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:38,253
No?

132
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,423
They killed Jory.

133
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:43,467
My father is hurt.

134
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:46,803
I don't care about stupid wooden swords.

135
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,764
You are troubled.

136
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,432
- Yes.
- Good!

137
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,768
Trouble is the perfect time for training.

138
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:56,104
When you are dancing in the meadow
with your dolls and kittens,

139
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:58,106
this is not when fighting happens.

140
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:00,275
I don't like dolls and k...

141
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:03,278
You're not here.

142
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,323
You're with your trouble.

143
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:09,284
If you are with your trouble
when fighting happens...

144
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:15,040
...more trouble for you.

145
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,167
Just so.

146
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,213
How can you be quick as a snake...

147
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:27,386
...or as quiet as a shadow...

148
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,767
...when you are somewhere else?

149
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,147
You are fearing for your father, hmm?

150
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:43,610
That is right.

151
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:46,822
- Do you pray to the gods?
- The old and the new.

152
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:50,450
There is only one god...

153
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:54,204
and his name is death.

154
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:57,165
And there is only one thing we say to death -

155
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,294
"Not today."

156
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:11,013
[Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!]
A boy! A boy! A strong boy!

157
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:15,218
[Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!] A boy! A boy! A strong boy!
[Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!] A boy! A boy! A strong boy!

158
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:18,187
[Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!] A boy! A boy! A strong boy!

159
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,779
She has to eat the whole heart?

160
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:30,616
I hope that wasn't my horse.

161
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:32,492
She's doing well.

162
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:34,620
She'll never keep it down.

163
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:36,785
[Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!] A boy! A boy! A strong boy!

164
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:52,846
[Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!] A boy! A boy! A strong boy!

165
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,811
Tell me what she's saying.

166
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:02,439
"The prince is riding.

167
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:05,442
"I have heard the thunder
of his hooves.

168
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:07,778
"Swift as the wind he rides.

169
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:12,199
"His enemies will cower before him...

170
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:17,079
"..and their wives will weep tears of blood."

171
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,918
She's going to have a boy.

172
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:28,423
He won't be a real Targaryen.

173
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,717
He won't be a true dragon.

174
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:24,188
[Vezh fin saja rhaesheseres!]
The stallion that mounts the world!

175
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:27,316
"The stallion who mounts the world."

176
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:30,360
The stallion is the khal of khals.

177
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:33,572
He shall unite the people
into a single khalasar.

178
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:36,909
All the people of the world will be his herd.

179
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:45,542
[Khalakka dothrae mr'anha.]
A prince rides inside me!

180
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:49,505
[Ma me nem ahakee ma Rhaego!]
And he shall be called Rhaego!

181
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:52,007
Rhaego! Rhaego!

182
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,218
Rhaego! Rhaego!

183
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:56,970
Rhaego! Rhaego...

184
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:05,687
They love her.

185
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:12,277
Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego...

186
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:32,798
She truly is a queen today.

187
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:04,621
Don't let them see you carrying a sword
in Vaes Dothrak.

188
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:06,748
You know the law.

189
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:08,834
It's not my law.

190
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,794
They don't belong to you.

191
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:13,172
Whatever is hers is also mine.

192
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:15,883
Once, perhaps.

193
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:20,637
If I sell one egg,
I'll have enough to buy a ship.

194
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:22,890
Two eggs - a ship and an army.

195
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:26,143
- And you have all three.
- I need a large army.

196
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:29,688
I'm the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont.

197
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:32,524
The greatest dynasty
this world has ever seen

198
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:35,110
on my shoulders
since I was five years old,

199
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:39,990
and no one has ever given me
what they gave to her in that tent. Never.

200
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,575
Not a piece of it.

201
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:46,705
How can I carry
what I need to carry without it? Hmm?

202
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,082
Who can rule without wealth or fear or love?

203
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:57,299
Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honour.

204
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:04,056
You don't think I see you
looking at my little sister, hmm?

205
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,517
Don't think I know what you want?

206
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:11,813
I don't care. You can have her.

207
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,068
She can be queen of the savages
and dine on the finest bloody horseparts,

208
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:19,821
and you can dine
on whichever parts of her you like.

209
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:22,616
But let me go.

210
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:26,203
You can go.

211
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:28,080
You can't have the eggs.

212
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:29,998
You swore an oath to me.

213
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:32,417
Does loyalty mean nothing to you?

214
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:34,586
It means everything to me.

215
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:36,630
And yet here you stand.

216
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:38,757
And yet here I stand.

217
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:57,401
Mord!

218
00:21:58,402 --> 00:21:59,945
Mord!

219
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:03,907
Mord!

220
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:09,621
Mord!

221
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:12,457
Mord!

222
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:15,460
Noise again!

223
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:20,716
- About the gold...
- No gold!

224
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:24,303
- No gold.
- Listen to me! Listen to me.

225
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:27,472
Sometimes possession...

226
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:29,600
is an abstract concept...

227
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:36,190
When they captured me, they took my purse,
but the gold is still mine.

228
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:38,025
Where?

229
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:41,445
Where? I don't know where,
but when they free me...

230
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:42,821
You want free?

231
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:46,116
Go be free.

232
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:49,578
Have you ever heard the phrase...

233
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:51,496
"Rich as a Lannister"?

234
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:56,126
Of course you have!

235
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:59,129
You're a smart man.

236
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:02,007
You know who the Lannisters are.

237
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:05,886
I am a Lannister.

238
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:09,640
Tyrion, son of Tywin!

239
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:14,228
And of course,
you have also heard the phrase,

240
00:23:14,353 --> 00:23:17,022
"a Lannister always pays his debts."

241
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:21,026
if you deliver a message from me...

242
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:25,864
to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt.

243
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:29,993
I will owe you gold.

244
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:34,039
If you deliver the message...

245
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:37,292
and I live,
which I very much intend to do.

246
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:41,713
What message?

247
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:51,306
Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.

248
00:23:57,604 --> 00:24:00,482
You wish to confess your crimes?

249
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:03,068
Yes, my lady. I do, my lady.

250
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:07,114
The sky cells always break them.

251
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:09,449
Speak, Imp.

252
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:11,743
Meet your gods as an honest man.

253
00:24:16,707 --> 00:24:20,169
Where do I begin, my lords and ladies?

254
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:25,424
I'm a vile man, I confess it.

255
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:28,594
My crimes and sins are beyond counting.

256
00:24:29,595 --> 00:24:31,555
I have lied and cheated...

257
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:34,975
gambled and whored.

258
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:39,646
I'm not particularly good at violence, but...

259
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:43,567
I'm good at convincing others
to do violence for me.

260
00:24:44,902 --> 00:24:46,862
You want specifics, I suppose.

261
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:52,868
When I was seven, I saw a servant girl...
bathing in the river.

262
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,828
I stole her robe.

263
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:59,124
She was forced to return to the castle
naked and in tears.

264
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:04,296
If I close my eyes,
I can still see her tits bouncing.

265
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:12,346
When I was 10,
I stumped my uncle's boots with goatshit.

266
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:16,058
When confronted with my crime,
I blamed a squire.

267
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:19,603
Poor boy was flogged and...
I escaped justice.

268
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:24,399
When I was 12 I milked my eel
into a pot of turtle stew.

269
00:25:24,525 --> 00:25:27,361
I flogged the one-eyed snake.

270
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:29,363
I skinned my sausage.

271
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:34,743
I made the bald man cry
into the turtle stew,

272
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:36,745
which I do believe my sister ate.

273
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,747
At least I hope she did.

274
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:42,084
I once brought a jackass
and a honeycomb into a brothel...

275
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:43,210
Silence!

276
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:44,837
What happened next?

277
00:25:45,838 --> 00:25:47,965
What do you think you're doing?

278
00:25:48,966 --> 00:25:50,884
Confessing my crimes.

279
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:57,057
Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man
to slay my son Bran in his bed,

280
00:25:57,182 --> 00:25:59,852
and of conspiring to murder
my sister's husband -

281
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:03,689
Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.

282
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:05,983
Oh, I'm very sorry.

283
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:09,069
I don't know anything about all that.

284
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:12,531
You've had your little joke.

285
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:14,867
I trust you enjoyed it.

286
00:26:14,992 --> 00:26:17,870
Mord, take him back to the dungeon.

287
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:21,331
But this time find a smaller cell...
with a steeper floor.

288
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:26,503
Is this how justice is done in the Vale?

289
00:26:27,838 --> 00:26:29,715
You accuse me of crimes,

290
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,049
I deny them,

291
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:34,511
so you throw me into a cell
to freeze and starve?

292
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:37,764
Where is the king's justice?

293
00:26:37,848 --> 00:26:40,058
I am accused and demand a trial!

294
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:47,232
If you're tried and found guilty, then by the
king's own laws you will pay with your life.

295
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,776
I understand the law.

296
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:53,614
We have no executioner in the Eyrie.

297
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,866
Life is more elegant here.

298
00:26:56,617 --> 00:26:58,368
Open the Moon Door.

299
00:27:19,348 --> 00:27:22,059
You want a trial, my Lord Lannister.

300
00:27:22,184 --> 00:27:24,144
Very well.

301
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:26,730
My son will listen
to whatever you have to say,

302
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:28,565
and you will hear his judgement.

303
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:31,777
Then you will leave...

304
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:33,779
by one door or the other.

305
00:27:33,904 --> 00:27:36,240
No need to bother Lord Robin.

306
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:39,368
I demand a trial by combat.

307
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:51,046
You have that right.

308
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:54,091
My lady, I beg the honour.

309
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:56,093
Let me be your champion.

310
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:58,512
The honour should be mine.

311
00:27:58,637 --> 00:28:01,056
For the love I bore your lord husband...

312
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:02,766
let me avenge his death.

313
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:05,310
- I'll fight for you, my lady.
- It'll be my honour.

314
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:08,438
- The honour should be mine.
- Make the bad man fly!

315
00:28:10,274 --> 00:28:11,650
Ser Vardis...

316
00:28:12,568 --> 00:28:14,361
you're quiet.

317
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:16,572
Don't you want to avenge my husband?

318
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:21,326
With all my heart, my lady.

319
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,745
But the Imp is half my size.

320
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:27,207
It would be shameful to slaughter such a man
and call it justice.

321
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:28,500
Agreed.

322
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,961
You demanded a trial by combat.

323
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:34,756
Now I demand a champion.
I have that right, same as you.

324
00:28:34,882 --> 00:28:36,508
My lady,

325
00:28:36,592 --> 00:28:39,553
I will gladly fight the Imp's champion for you.

326
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,806
I wouldn't be too glad, ser.

327
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:45,475
I name my brother, Jaime Lannister.

328
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:49,646
The Kingslayer
is hundreds of miles from here.

329
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:52,232
Send a raven for him. I'm happy to wait.

330
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:55,277
The trial will be today.

331
00:28:58,697 --> 00:29:00,824
Do I have a volunteer?

332
00:29:08,707 --> 00:29:10,626
Anyone?

333
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:13,170
Anyone?

334
00:29:16,215 --> 00:29:18,592
I think we can assume that no one is willing...

335
00:29:18,717 --> 00:29:20,469
I'll stand for the dwarf.

336
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:34,149
More wine, Your Grace?

337
00:29:36,235 --> 00:29:38,737
- What was I saying?
- Simpler time.

338
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:41,990
It was! It was.
You're too young to remember.

339
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:43,825
Wasn't it simpler, Selmy?

340
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:47,329
- It was, Your Grace.
- The enemy was right there in the open,

341
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:51,500
vicious as you like,
all but sending you a bloody invitation.

342
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:53,418
Nothing like today.

343
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:56,380
- It sounds exhilarating.
- Exhilarating, yes.

344
00:29:56,505 --> 00:30:01,218
Not as exhilarating as those balls
and masquerades you like to throw.

345
00:30:06,223 --> 00:30:08,642
You ever fuck a Riverlands girl?

346
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:10,310
Once. I think.

347
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:14,106
You think? I think you'd remember.

348
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:17,109
Back in our day, you weren't a real man

349
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:20,237
until you'd fucked one girl
from each of the Seven Kingdoms

350
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,989
and the Riverlands.

351
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:25,284
- We used to call it "making the eight."
- Those were some lucky girls.

352
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:27,369
You ever make the eight, Barristan?

353
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:29,329
I don't believe so, Your Grace.

354
00:30:29,413 --> 00:30:31,164
Those were the days.

355
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,041
Which days, exactly?

356
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:36,628
The ones where half of Westeros
fought the other half and millions died?

357
00:30:36,712 --> 00:30:39,798
Or before that, when the Mad King
slaughtered women and babies

358
00:30:39,882 --> 00:30:42,843
because the voices in his head
told him they deserved it?

359
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:46,305
Or way before that, when dragons burned
whole cities to the ground?

360
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:48,432
Easy, boy.

361
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:51,560
You might be my brother,
but you're speaking to the king.

362
00:30:51,602 --> 00:30:53,145
I suppose it was all rather heroic.

363
00:30:53,312 --> 00:30:55,981
If you were drunk enough
and had some poor Riverlands whore

364
00:30:56,064 --> 00:30:58,609
to shove your prick inside
and make the eight.

365
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:04,615
More wine, Your Grace?

366
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:25,052
They burned most everything
in the Riverlands -

367
00:31:25,177 --> 00:31:28,722
our fields, our granaries,

368
00:31:28,847 --> 00:31:31,266
our homes.

369
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:35,312
They took our women,
then they took 'em again.

370
00:31:35,437 --> 00:31:39,775
When they was done, they butchered them
as if they was animals.

371
00:31:39,858 --> 00:31:43,111
They covered our children in pitch...

372
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:45,697
and lit them on fire.

373
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:48,951
Brigands, most likely.

374
00:31:50,244 --> 00:31:54,039
They weren't thieves.
They didn't steal nothing.

375
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:57,417
They even left something behind, Your Grace.

376
00:31:57,543 --> 00:32:00,796
It's the King's Hand you're addressing,
not the king.

377
00:32:00,921 --> 00:32:02,756
The king is hunting.

378
00:32:10,556 --> 00:32:12,975
Fish. The sigil of House Tully.

379
00:32:14,268 --> 00:32:17,813
Isn't that your wife's House - Tully -
my Lord Hand?

380
00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:25,946
These men, were they flying a sigil?

381
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:30,826
- A banner?
- None, your... Hand.

382
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:33,328
The one who was leading them...

383
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:36,874
Taller by a foot
than any man I've ever met,

384
00:32:36,957 --> 00:32:40,210
saw him cut the blacksmith in two,

385
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:45,174
saw him take the head of a horse
with a single swing of his sword.

386
00:32:45,257 --> 00:32:47,759
That sounds like someone we know.

387
00:32:47,843 --> 00:32:49,887
The Mountain.

388
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:53,056
You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.

389
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,976
Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand?

390
00:32:56,101 --> 00:32:58,187
The man is an anointed knight.

391
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:01,356
I've heard him called
Tywin Lannister's mad dog.

392
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,609
I'm sure you have as well.

393
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:07,487
Can you think of any reason
the Lannisters might possibly have

394
00:33:07,613 --> 00:33:09,239
for being angry with your wife?

395
00:33:09,364 --> 00:33:16,413
If the Lannisters were to order attacks
on villages under the king's protection,

396
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:19,208
- it would be...
- That would be almost as brazen

397
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:22,419
as attacking the Hand of the King
in the streets of the capital.

398
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:24,129
Well...

399
00:33:28,717 --> 00:33:33,722
I cannot give you back your homes
or restore your dead to life,

400
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:38,435
but perhaps I can give you justice
in the name of our king, Robert.

401
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:41,730
Lord Beric Dondarrion.

402
00:33:45,901 --> 00:33:47,903
You shall have the command.

403
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:51,281
Assemble 100 men
and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.

404
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:53,200
As you command.

405
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:03,502
In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon,
the First of his Name,

406
00:34:03,585 --> 00:34:05,504
King of the Andals and the First Men,

407
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:09,883
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm,

408
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:14,012
I charge you to bring the king's justice
to the false knight Gregor Clegane

409
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:16,473
and all those who shared in his crimes.

410
00:34:16,515 --> 00:34:19,268
I denounce him and attaint him.

411
00:34:20,477 --> 00:34:23,856
I strip him of all ranks and titles...

412
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:26,984
of all lands and holdings...

413
00:34:27,568 --> 00:34:29,236
and sentence him to death.

414
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:33,782
My lord...
This... this is a drastic action.

415
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:36,618
It would be better to wait
for King Robert's return.

416
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:39,121
- Grand Maester Pycelle.
- My lord.

417
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:41,498
Send a raven to Casterly Rock.

418
00:34:41,582 --> 00:34:44,918
Inform Tywin Lannister
that he has been summoned to court

419
00:34:45,043 --> 00:34:47,045
to answer for the crimes of his bannermen.

420
00:34:47,171 --> 00:34:51,216
He will arrive within the fortnight,
or be branded an enemy of the Crown

421
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:53,260
and a traitor to the realm.

422
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:10,944
A bold move, my lord, and admirable.

423
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:13,447
But is it wise to yank the lion's tail?

424
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:16,992
Tywin Lannister is the richest man
in all the Seven Kingdoms.

425
00:35:18,285 --> 00:35:21,038
Gold wins wars, not soldiers.

426
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:25,334
Then how come Robert is king
and not Tywin Lannister?

427
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,359
Fight!

428
00:35:58,283 --> 00:36:01,828
Hold!

429
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:04,164
- Attack! Attack!
- Come on, Ser Vardis!

430
00:36:04,248 --> 00:36:05,791
Attack!

431
00:36:10,379 --> 00:36:12,756
Stand and fight, coward!

432
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:15,777
Yes!

433
00:37:18,822 --> 00:37:21,575
Enough, Ser Vardis! Finish him.

434
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:42,888
What are you doing? Get up!

435
00:37:43,055 --> 00:37:45,933
Get up, get up, get up!

436
00:37:48,185 --> 00:37:50,145
Raise your sword. Raise it!

437
00:37:53,607 --> 00:37:55,234
Get up, man!

438
00:37:55,317 --> 00:37:59,446
- On your feet!
- Get up! Get up and fight, Ser Vardis!

439
00:38:13,585 --> 00:38:16,213
No! Have mercy!

440
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:43,073
Is it over?

441
00:38:47,286 --> 00:38:50,122
You don't fight with honour!

442
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,376
No.

443
00:38:57,212 --> 00:38:58,380
He did.

444
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:14,188
Can I make the little man fly now?

445
00:39:14,271 --> 00:39:16,190
Not this little man.

446
00:39:16,315 --> 00:39:18,567
This little man is going home.

447
00:39:20,736 --> 00:39:22,613
I believe you have something of mine.

448
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:45,385
A Lannister always pays his debts.

449
00:40:02,903 --> 00:40:07,157
You wear your hair like
a real southern lady now.

450
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:10,327
Well, why shouldn't I?
We're in the South.

451
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:13,705
It's important to remember
where you come from.

452
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:17,042
I'm not sure your mother
would like these new styles.

453
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:19,545
My mother isn't from the North.

454
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:22,840
I'm aware of that.

455
00:40:22,923 --> 00:40:26,510
Why do you care?
Do you even have hair under there?

456
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:29,847
Yes. I have hair.

457
00:40:29,972 --> 00:40:31,598
I've never seen it.

458
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:33,892
Would you like to?

459
00:40:34,476 --> 00:40:35,894
No.

460
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:40,399
Where are you from anyway?
The North or the South?

461
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:46,196
- I come from a very small village in...
- Oh, wait.

462
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,657
I just realized... I don't care.

463
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:50,993
- Sansa...
- Septa.

464
00:40:51,076 --> 00:40:54,329
Now you are being rude.

465
00:41:00,169 --> 00:41:01,712
My prince.

466
00:41:04,548 --> 00:41:06,466
My prince.

467
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,135
My lady.

468
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:13,223
I fear I have behaved monstrously
the past few weeks.

469
00:41:16,768 --> 00:41:18,687
With your permission?

470
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,993
It's beautiful,

471
00:41:33,994 --> 00:41:35,913
like the one your mother wears.

472
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,998
You'll be queen someday.

473
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:40,751
It's only fitting you should look the part.

474
00:41:45,506 --> 00:41:48,133
Will you forgive me for my rudeness?

475
00:41:49,134 --> 00:41:50,928
There's nothing to forgive.

476
00:41:52,596 --> 00:41:54,348
You're my lady.

477
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:58,519
One day we'll be married
in the throne room.

478
00:41:58,644 --> 00:42:02,523
Lords and ladies from all over
the Seven Kingdoms will come,

479
00:42:02,689 --> 00:42:04,858
from the last hearth in the North

480
00:42:04,983 --> 00:42:07,819
to the salt shore in the South.

481
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:11,031
And you will be queen over all of them.

482
00:42:14,451 --> 00:42:16,745
I'll never disrespect you again.

483
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:19,957
I'll never be cruel to you again.

484
00:42:20,082 --> 00:42:22,251
Do you understand me?

485
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:25,796
You're my lady now...

486
00:42:27,422 --> 00:42:28,674
from this day...

487
00:42:30,634 --> 00:42:32,678
until my last day.

488
00:42:55,617 --> 00:42:57,369
Stop.

489
00:42:57,494 --> 00:42:59,413
- Stop!
- Whoa.

490
00:43:00,706 --> 00:43:03,417
- What are you doing?
- Going to King's Landing.

491
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,544
In a turnip cart?

492
00:43:05,711 --> 00:43:08,505
I'll find a ship heading south in White Harbour.

493
00:43:09,673 --> 00:43:11,425
And you can afford that?

494
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:14,219
Some of my friends
are more generous than others.

495
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,889
There's a thousand girls like you
in King's Landing.

496
00:43:16,972 --> 00:43:19,141
So I'll have lots of company.

497
00:43:19,308 --> 00:43:20,934
Yes, you'll be very popular...

498
00:43:21,018 --> 00:43:24,605
until some fat lord comes to visit
with a big belly and a little prick

499
00:43:24,688 --> 00:43:27,608
and he can't get it up
so he knocks all your teeth out.

500
00:43:27,733 --> 00:43:29,943
And what will happen to me if I stay here?

501
00:43:30,027 --> 00:43:34,031
Will I become Lady Greyjoy,
Mistress of the Iron Islands?

502
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:35,156
Don't be a fool.

503
00:43:35,157 --> 00:43:39,119
I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark
in the streets of King's Landing.

504
00:43:39,786 --> 00:43:42,956
Every man for a hundred miles
will be marching off to war soon

505
00:43:42,998 --> 00:43:44,917
and most of them will never come back.

506
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,919
There's nothing left for me here.

507
00:43:48,253 --> 00:43:50,297
Let's go, Stemon.

508
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,798
Giddy up.

509
00:43:51,882 --> 00:43:54,051
Let me see it one more time!

510
00:43:54,885 --> 00:43:56,386
See what?

511
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,983
I'm going to miss you!

512
00:44:10,025 --> 00:44:11,777
I know.

513
00:44:25,624 --> 00:44:27,668
I'm sending you both back to Winterfell.

514
00:44:27,751 --> 00:44:29,127
- What?
- Listen...

515
00:44:29,253 --> 00:44:32,089
- What about Joffrey?
- Are you dying because of your leg?

516
00:44:32,256 --> 00:44:34,164
- Is that why you're sending us home?
- What? No.

517
00:44:34,174 --> 00:44:36,510
- Please, Father. Please don't.
- You can't.

518
00:44:36,635 --> 00:44:39,513
I've got my lessons with Syrio.
I'm finally getting good.

519
00:44:39,638 --> 00:44:44,393
This isn't a punishment. I want you back
in Winterfell for your own safety.

520
00:44:44,476 --> 00:44:45,894
Can we take Syrio back with us?

521
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:49,022
Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher?
I can't go.

522
00:44:49,147 --> 00:44:53,110
I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey.
I love him and I'm meant to be his queen

523
00:44:53,235 --> 00:44:55,237
- and have his babies.
- Seven hells.

524
00:44:55,404 --> 00:44:59,658
When you're old enough, I'll make you a match
with someone who's worthy of you,

525
00:44:59,741 --> 00:45:02,369
someone who's brave
and gentle and strong...

526
00:45:02,536 --> 00:45:05,706
I don't want someone brave
and gentle and strong. I want him!

527
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:08,542
He'll be the greatest king that ever was,
a golden lion,

528
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:11,420
and I'll give him sons
with beautiful blond hair.

529
00:45:11,545 --> 00:45:14,006
The lion's not his sigil, idiot.

530
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:15,841
He's a stag, like his father.

531
00:45:15,924 --> 00:45:18,677
He is not.
He's nothing like that old drunk king.

532
00:45:21,972 --> 00:45:24,766
Go on, girls.
Get your septa and start packing your things.

533
00:45:24,892 --> 00:45:26,226
- Wait!
- Come on.

534
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:27,895
But it's not fair!

535
00:46:02,554 --> 00:46:05,349
"Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair."

536
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:10,229
"Axel Baratheon, black of hair."

537
00:46:11,188 --> 00:46:14,149
"Lyonel Baratheon, black of hair."

538
00:46:15,692 --> 00:46:18,278
"Stemon Baratheon, black of hair."

539
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:26,328
"Robert Baratheon, black of hair."

540
00:46:28,372 --> 00:46:30,541
"Joffrey Baratheon...

541
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,752
"golden-haired."

542
00:47:05,576 --> 00:47:07,286
Daenerys!

543
00:47:09,663 --> 00:47:11,456
Where's my sister?

544
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,833
Stop him.

545
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:16,170
Where is she? Hmm?

546
00:47:18,922 --> 00:47:21,592
Where is she?
I'm here for the feast.

547
00:47:22,801 --> 00:47:24,219
The whore's feast?

548
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:26,805
- Come.
- Get your hands off me!

549
00:47:26,889 --> 00:47:29,224
No one touches the dragon!

550
00:47:30,225 --> 00:47:32,311
[Khal rhae mhar.]
The sore-foot king.

551
00:47:32,394 --> 00:47:35,063
[Me ifa.]
He walks.

552
00:47:37,816 --> 00:47:40,152
Khal Drogo!

553
00:47:40,235 --> 00:47:42,613
I'm here for the feast.

554
00:47:44,531 --> 00:47:47,531
[Nevakhi vekha ha maan.]
There is a place for you. Lit. A sitting-spot exists for him.

555
00:47:47,534 --> 00:47:49,912
Khal Drogo says there is a place for you.

556
00:47:50,037 --> 00:47:52,080
Back there.

557
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:56,585
That is no place for a king.

558
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:59,296
You are no king.

559
00:48:01,715 --> 00:48:03,759
Keep away from me!

560
00:48:03,884 --> 00:48:05,802
Viserys, please.

561
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:09,723
There she is.

562
00:48:14,311 --> 00:48:17,022
Put the sword down. They'll kill us all.

563
00:48:17,147 --> 00:48:19,608
They can't kill us.

564
00:48:20,651 --> 00:48:23,654
They can't shed blood in their sacred city.

565
00:48:30,786 --> 00:48:32,162
But I can.

566
00:48:42,005 --> 00:48:44,383
I want what I came for.

567
00:48:44,466 --> 00:48:46,718
I want the crown he promised me.

568
00:48:47,845 --> 00:48:49,596
He bought you.

569
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,723
But he never paid for you.

570
00:48:56,937 --> 00:49:01,066
Tell him I want what was bargained for
or I'm taking you back.

571
00:49:01,149 --> 00:49:03,735
He can keep the baby.

572
00:49:03,777 --> 00:49:06,029
I'll cut it out and leave it for him.

573
00:49:09,783 --> 00:49:12,536
[Anha vazhak maan rek me zala.]
I will give to him what he wants.

574
00:49:13,121 --> 00:49:20,416
[Anha vazhak maan firikhnharen hoshora ma mahrazhi aqovi affin mori atihi mae.]
I will give to him a golden crown and men will tremble when they will see it.

575
00:49:21,086 --> 00:49:22,462
What's he saying?

576
00:49:24,006 --> 00:49:25,632
He says yes.

577
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:29,970
You shall have a golden crown...

578
00:49:31,555 --> 00:49:34,224
...that men shall tremble to behold.

579
00:49:45,402 --> 00:49:47,571
That was all I wanted.

580
00:49:49,948 --> 00:49:51,992
W-What was promised.

581
00:50:08,717 --> 00:50:10,469
[Qora mae!]
Seize him!

582
00:50:11,803 --> 00:50:13,889
No!

583
00:50:13,972 --> 00:50:16,558
No! You cannot touch me.

584
00:50:16,642 --> 00:50:18,936
I am the dragon.
I am the dragon!

585
00:50:19,061 --> 00:50:21,772
I want my crown! Ahh!

586
00:50:21,855 --> 00:50:24,858
[Ammeni haz jolin!]
Empty that pot.

587
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:36,245
- Look away, Khaleesi.
- No.

588
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,629
No, Dany.

589
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:47,005
Dany, tell them.

590
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:48,549
Make them!

591
00:50:49,716 --> 00:50:52,302
Dany, make them...

592
00:50:54,096 --> 00:50:56,098
No, you can't!

593
00:50:56,223 --> 00:50:58,684
Just... Please!

594
00:50:59,393 --> 00:51:01,019
Dany, please!

595
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:06,316
A crown for a king.

596
00:51:21,832 --> 00:51:23,709
Khaleesi?

597
00:51:23,792 --> 00:51:25,878
He was no dragon.

598
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:29,715
Fire cannot kill a dragon.

599
00:51:32,087 --> 00:51:38,715
Gold in liquid form is not a fire, Daenerys.

"Arrive within the fortnight

6
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,304
Poor Ned Stark.

7
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,890
Brave man, terrible judgement.

8
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,189
Attacking him was stupid.

9
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,823
Lannisters...

10
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,409
don't act like fools.

11
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,459
Are you going to say something clever?

12
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,380
Go on, say something clever.

13
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,426
Catelyn Stark took my brother.

14
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,016
- Why is he still alive?
- Tyrion?

15
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,811
Ned Stark.

16
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,646
One of our men interfered,

17
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:11,024
speared him through the leg
before I could finish him.

18
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:14,236
Why is he still alive?

19
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,406
It wouldn't have been clean.

20
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:18,949
Clean.

21
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:24,329
You spend too much time worrying
about what other people think of you.

22
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,456
I could care less
what anyone thinks of me.

23
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:29,626
That's what you want
people to think of you.

24
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,961
It's the truth.

25
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,882
When you hear them whispering
"kingslayer" behind your back,

26
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,967
doesn't it bother you?

27
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,305
Of course it bothers me.

28
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,307
A lion doesn't concern himself

29
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,392
with the opinions of the sheep.

30
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,564
I suppose I should be grateful
that your vanity

31
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,733
got in the way
of your recklessness.

32
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,988
I'm giving you half of our forces -

33
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,489
30,000 men.

34
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:03,327
You will bring them to Catelyn Stark's
girlhood home

35
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,829
and remind her that Lannisters

36
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,873
pay their debts.

37
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:12,127
I didn't realise you placed such
a high value on my brother's life.

38
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,671
He's a Lannister.

39
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:18,133
He might be the lowest of the Lannisters,
but he's one of us.

40
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,677
And every day that he remains a prisoner,

41
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,680
the less our name commands respect.

42
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,005
So the lion does concern himself
with the opinions of...

43
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,352
No, that's not an opinion. It's a fact.

44
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,357
If another house
can seize one of our own

45
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,068
and hold him captive with impunity,

46
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,445
we are no longer a house to be feared.

47
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,035
Your mother's dead.

48
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,287
Before long I'll be dead.

49
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,206
And you...

50
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,500
and your brother
and your sister

51
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,126
and all of her children.

52
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:57,506
All of us dead,
all of us rotting in the ground.

53
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,051
It's the family name that lives on.

54
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,554
It's all that lives on.

55
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:06,723
Not your personal glory,
not your honour,

56
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,684
but family.

57
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:10,853
Do you understand?

58
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:15,858
Hmm.

59
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:26,743
You're blessed with abilities
that few men possess.

60
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:31,039
You're blessed to belong to the most
powerful family in the Kingdoms.

61
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,875
And you're still blessed with youth.

62
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:37,462
And what have you done
with these blessings, huh?

63
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:41,049
You've served as a glorified
bodyguard for two kings -

64
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:44,636
one a madman,
the other a drunk.

65
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:53,645
The future of our family will be determined
in these next few months.

66
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:57,816
We could establish a dynasty
that will last a thousand years.

67
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,320
Or we could collapse into nothing,
as the Targaryens did.

68
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:08,035
I need you to become the man
you were always meant to be.

69
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:12,331
Not next year. Not tomorrow.

70
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:13,999
Now.

71
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,988
You're in pain.

72
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,038
I've had worse, my lady.

73
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,416
Perhaps it's time to go home.

74
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,335
The South doesn't seem
to agree with you.

75
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,921
I know the truth Jon Arryn died for.

76
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,924
Do you, Lord Stark?

77
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,511
Is that why you called me here,
to pose me riddles?

78
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:11,056
Has he done this before?

79
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:17,563
Jaime would have killed him.
My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.

80
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,273
Your brother...

81
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,691
or your lover?

82
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:28,115
The Targaryens wed brothers
and sisters for 300 years

83
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,742
to keep bloodlines pure.

84
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:32,911
Jaime and I are more
than brother and sister.

85
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,163
We shared a womb.

86
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:38,125
We came into this world together.
We belong together.

87
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,128
My son saw you with him.

88
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:49,094
Do you love your children?

89
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,099
- With all my heart.
- No more than I love mine.

90
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,349
- And they're all Jaime's.
- Thank the gods.

91
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:58,113
In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores
for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed,

92
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,938
I finish him off in other ways.

93
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:02,774
- In the morning, he doesn't remember.
- You've always hated him.

94
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,069
Hated him? I worshipped him.

95
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:10,908
Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed
of him, but he was mine by oath.

96
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:14,953
And when I finally saw him
on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor,

97
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,788
lean and fierce and black-bearded,

98
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:19,082
it was the happiest moment of my life.

99
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,003
That night he crawled on top of me,
stinking of wine,

100
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,964
and did what he did,
what little he could do,

101
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,219
and whispered in my ear, "Lyanna".

102
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,640
Your sister was a corpse
and I was a living girl

103
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,767
and he loved her more than me.

104
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:42,314
When the king returns from his hunt,
I'll tell him the truth.

105
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,651
You must be gone by then -
you and your children.

106
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:48,445
I will not have
their blood on my hands.

107
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,989
Go as far away as you can,

108
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,325
with as many men as you can.

109
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,786
Because wherever you go,

110
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,163
Robert's wrath will follow you.

111
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,999
And what of my wrath, Lord Stark?

112
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,377
You should have taken the realm for yourself.

113
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:06,338
Jaime told me about the day
King's Landing fell.

114
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:09,258
He was sitting in the Iron Throne
and you made him give it up.

115
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,718
All you needed to do
was climb the steps yourself.

116
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:14,471
Such a sad mistake.

117
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,099
I've made many mistakes in my life...

118
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,768
but that wasn't one of them.

119
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,436
Oh, but it was.

120
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,773
When you play the game of thrones,
you win...

121
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:26,316
or you die.

122
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,319
There is no middle ground.

123
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,454
Come here.

124
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:58,765
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

125
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:03,061
Oh!

126
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:07,065
Oh, yes! Oh! Oh!

127
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:11,153
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Oh!

128
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,823
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

129
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,450
Oh!

130
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:19,411
No, no, no, no!

131
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,832
Is that what they teach you
up in the North?

132
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,586
And you -
wherever you're from -

133
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,632
do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

134
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,136
Either of you understand
a thing that I'm saying?

135
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:38,931
Yes, my lord.

136
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,308
Let's start over, shall we?

137
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,853
You be the man...

138
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:46,939
and you be the woman.

139
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:52,819
Well, go ahead.

140
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,449
Slowly.

141
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,919
You're not fooling them.
They just paid you.

142
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,463
They know what you are.

143
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,674
They know it's all just an act.

144
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:16,552
Your job is to make them
forget what they know.

145
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:18,762
Now, that takes time.

146
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,557
You need to...

147
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,600
ease into it.

148
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,771
Go ahead.

149
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,524
Ease into it.

150
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:43,120
He's winning you over
in spite of yourself.

151
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:45,038
You're starting to like this.

152
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,041
He wants to believe you.

153
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:52,087
He's enjoyed his cock since he was old
enough to play with it. Why shouldn't you?

154
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:55,382
He knows he's better
than other men.

155
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:58,927
He's always known it deep down inside.
Now he has proof.

156
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:01,555
He's so good,

157
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,393
he's reaching something deep inside of you
that no one even knew was there,

158
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,104
overcoming your very nature.

159
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:13,442
Why don't you join us, my lord?

160
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,070
I'm saving myself for another.

161
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,698
What she doesn't know won't hurt her.

162
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,825
A stupid saying.

163
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:24,953
What we don't know is usually
what gets us killed.

164
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,457
She must be very beautiful.

165
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,252
No, not really.
Impeccable bloodlines though.

166
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,338
I do believe my lord's in love.

167
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,841
For many years.
Most of my life, really.

168
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:39,176
Play with her arse.

169
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:41,428
And she loved me too.

170
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,974
I was her little confidant, her plaything.

171
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:49,061
She could tell me anything,
anything at all.

172
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:53,023
She told me about all the horses
that she liked,

173
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:55,442
the castle that she wanted to live in

174
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:58,445
and the man that she wanted to marry -

175
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:01,823
a Northerner...
with a jaw like an anvil.

176
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:05,077
So I challenged him to a duel.

177
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,996
I mean, why not?
I'd read all the stories.

178
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:11,792
The little hero always beats
the big villain in all the stories.

179
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:16,338
In the end,
she wouldn't even let him kill me.

180
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,882
"He's just a boy," she said.

181
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,926
"Please don't hurt him."

182
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:25,764
So he gave me a nice little scar
to remember him by, and off they went.

183
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:27,599
Is she still married to him?

184
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:30,644
Oh, no. He got himself killed
before the wedding...

185
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:36,525
...and she ended up with his brother,
an even more impressive specimen.

186
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,236
She loves him, I'm afraid.

187
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:42,906
And why wouldn't she?
I mean, who could compare to him?

188
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,242
He's just so...

189
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:52,749
...good.

190
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,754
Do you know what I learned,
losing that duel?

191
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:02,092
I learned that I'll never win, not that way.

192
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:04,094
That's their game,

193
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:06,763
their rules.

194
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,849
I'm not going to fight them.

195
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:12,144
I'm going to fuck them.
That's what I know.

196
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:14,396
That's what I am.

197
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,357
And only by admitting what we are
can we get what we want.

198
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,777
And what do you want?

199
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,447
Oh, everything, my dear.

200
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,408
Everything there is.

201
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,414
Now wash yourselves.
Both of you are working tonight.

202
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,464
Hmm.

203
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:05,948
You're a very lucky girl.
Do you know that?

204
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:12,746
Where I come from,
we don't show mercy to criminals.

205
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:16,542
Where I come from,
if someone like you attacked a little lord...

206
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:19,920
at low tide we'd lay you
on your back on the beach,

207
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:22,923
your hands and feet
chained to four stakes.

208
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:25,551
The sea would come in
closer and closer.

209
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:29,263
You'd see death creeping towards you
a few inches at a time.

210
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,392
Where is it you come from?

211
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,602
The Iron Islands.

212
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:36,770
They far away?

213
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:39,273
You've never heard of the Iron Islands?

214
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:43,026
Trust me, you've never heard
where I'm from neither.

215
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:46,488
"Trust me, my lord."

216
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,618
You're not living in the wilderness anymore.

217
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:53,996
In civilised lands,
you refer to your betters

218
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,206
by their proper titles.

219
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,959
- And what's that?
- Lord.

220
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:00,919
Why?

221
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:03,672
Why?

222
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,716
What do you mean, why?

223
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:09,052
My father is Balon Greyjoy,
Lord of the Iron Islands.

224
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:10,762
What's that got to do with you?

225
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:13,724
If your father's lord,

226
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:15,726
how can you be lord too?

227
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:20,314
- I will be lord after my father.
- So you're not lord now?

228
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:22,274
No, you...

229
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,154
Are you having a go at me?
Is that it?

230
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,073
I just don't understand
how you southerners do things.

231
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:33,452
- I'm not a southerner.
- You're from south of the Wall.

232
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:36,622
That makes you a southerner to me.

233
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:41,585
You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?

234
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,463
Couldn't say, my lord.

235
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:46,507
Don't know what "impunent" means.

236
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,509
Impudent.

237
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:51,970
It means rude, disrespectful.

238
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:58,268
Do you want to lose that chain?

239
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:02,648
Theon Greyjoy!

240
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:05,192
The lady is our guest.

241
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:07,194
I thought she was our prisoner.

242
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:10,948
Are the two mutually exclusive
in your experience?

243
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,378
Chances are I won't be nearby
the next time that happens.

244
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:26,255
I'm used to worse than him.

245
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:27,381
Hmm?

246
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:30,217
I'm used to men who could
chew that boy up

247
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:32,761
and pick their teeth with his bones.

248
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:40,352
Why did you come here?

249
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,437
Didn't mean to come here.

250
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,440
Meant to get much further south than this.

251
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:48,443
As far south as south goes,

252
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,654
before the long night comes.

253
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:54,575
Why? What are you afraid of?

254
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,745
There's things that sleep in the day
and hunt at night.

255
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:03,458
- Owls and shadowcats...
- I'm not talking about owls and shadowcats.

256
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:10,048
The things you speak of -

257
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:13,677
they've been gone
for thousands of years.

258
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,637
They wasn't gone, old man.

259
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,515
They was sleeping.

260
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:22,144
And they ain't sleeping no more.

261
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,780
I miss girls.

262
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:36,617
Not even talking to them.
I never talked to them.

263
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:40,204
Just looking at them,

264
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,872
hearing them giggle.

265
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:49,588
Don't you miss girls?

266
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,844
Riders.

267
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:59,306
The horn.
We have to blow the horn.

268
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:02,601
Why is he alone?

269
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:06,980
One blast for a ranger returning,

270
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:08,857
two for wildlings,

271
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:11,109
- three for...
- There's no rider.

272
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,352
Whoa, boy, whoa.

273
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:47,563
That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.

274
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,698
Where's my uncle?

275
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:02,411
Ned!

276
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:07,207
It's Robert.
We were hunting...

277
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:09,084
a boar...

278
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:19,428
I should have
spent more time with you,

279
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:22,264
shown you how to be a man.

280
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:28,103
I was never meant to be a father.

281
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:50,501
Go on.

282
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,711
You don't want to see this.

283
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:08,936
My fault.

284
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:12,397
Too much wine,
missed my thrust.

285
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:23,909
It stinks.

286
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:27,204
It stinks like death.

287
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:30,123
Don't think I can't smell it.

288
00:21:32,835 --> 00:21:35,587
I paid the bastard back, Ned.

289
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:39,007
I drove my knife
right through his brain.

290
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,552
You ask 'em if I didn't. Ask 'em!

291
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:47,599
I want the funeral feast to be
the biggest the Kingdoms ever saw.

292
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:52,271
And I want everyone
to taste the boar that got me.

293
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:59,236
Now leave us, the lot of you.
I need to talk to Ned.

294
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:02,489
- Robert, my sweet...
- Out, all of you!

295
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:25,179
You damned fool.

296
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:27,472
Paper and ink on the table.

297
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:29,850
Write down what I say.

298
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:41,486
"In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

299
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,738
"first of..."

300
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:44,406
You know how it goes.

301
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:47,075
Fill in the damn titles.

302
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:49,244
"I hereby command

303
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:52,122
"Eddard of House Stark..."

304
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:54,708
titles, titles...

305
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:58,253
"to serve as Lord Regent
and Protector of the Realm

306
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,506
"upon my death,

307
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:03,550
"to rule in my stead

308
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:06,178
"until my son Joffrey comes of age."

309
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:26,198
Give it over.

310
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:43,924
Give it to the council...

311
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:45,634
after I'm dead.

312
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:49,096
At least they'll say I did this right,

313
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:51,598
this one thing.

314
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:53,475
You'll rule now.

315
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:57,354
You'll hate it worse than I did...

316
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:00,440
but you'll do it well.

317
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:06,363
The girl...

318
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,031
Daenerys.

319
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:13,036
You were right.
Varys, Littlefinger,

320
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:16,039
my brother... worthless.

321
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:18,417
No one to tell me "no" but you.

322
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:22,963
Only you.

323
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:28,051
Let her live.

324
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:31,388
Stop it, if it's not too late.

325
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:33,182
I will.

326
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:35,601
And my son...

327
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,103
help him, Ned.

328
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,565
Make him better than me.

329
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:44,651
I'll...

330
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:48,405
I'll do everything I can
to honour your memory.

331
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:51,825
My memory.

332
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:56,663
King Robert Baratheon,

333
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:58,957
murdered by a pig.

334
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:06,173
Give me something for the pain
and let me die.

335
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:23,023
Give him milk of the poppy.

336
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:33,075
He was reeling from the wine.

337
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:36,870
He commanded us to...

338
00:25:36,954 --> 00:25:38,288
step aside, but...

339
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:41,542
I failed him.

340
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,547
No man could have
protected him from himself.

341
00:25:48,507 --> 00:25:50,384
I wonder, Ser Barristan,

342
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:53,303
who gave the king this wine?

343
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:57,432
His squire,
from the king's own skin.

344
00:25:57,558 --> 00:26:00,185
His squire? The Lannister boy?

345
00:26:00,978 --> 00:26:03,438
Such a dutiful boy
to make sure His Grace

346
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:05,983
did not lack refreshment.

347
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:09,570
I do hope the poor lad
does not blame himself.

348
00:26:17,578 --> 00:26:21,290
His Grace has had a change of heart
concerning Daenerys Targaryen.

349
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:26,128
Whatever arrangements you made...

350
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:29,673
unmake them. At once.

351
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:33,093
I'm afraid those birds have flown.

352
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:36,263
The girl is likely dead already.

353
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:50,726
[Vezh fin saja rhaesheseres vo zigereo adoroon shiqethi.]
The stallion who mounts the world has no need for iron chairs.

354
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:52,436
[K'asi assikhqoyisiri...]
According to the prophecy...

355
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:54,938
[...vezh adothrae nakhaan rhaesheseri.]
...the stallion will ride to the ends of the earth.

356
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:57,691
[Sorfosor nakha she Havazzhifi Kazga.]
The earth ends at the black salt sea.

357
00:26:57,701 --> 00:26:59,735
[Vo hrazef laz yoma evethiz.]
No horse can cross the poison water.

358
00:26:59,745 --> 00:27:01,904
[Sorfosor nakho vosecchi she havazh...]
The earth does not end at the sea...

359
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:04,323
[...Sani sorfi vekha yomme havash.]
...there are many dirts beyond the sea.

360
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:07,373
[Sorfo athyolari anni.]
The dirts of my birth. (The dirt where I was born)

361
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:12,341
[Vo sorfo. Rhaeshi.]
Not dirts. Lands.

362
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:14,760
[Rhaeshi, sek.]
Lands, yes...

363
00:27:16,595 --> 00:27:18,795
[Dalen rhaggati evetha ma ale vekhi she Vaes Seris]
There are thousands of ships in the free cities.

364
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:20,839
[Hrazef ido fini ovethi yomme havazh.]
Wooden horses that fly across the sea...

365
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:24,593
[Kisha vastoki vos alikh hrazefi ido m'adori shiqethi.]
Let's speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs.

366
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:26,723
[Me vos ador. Me... me...]
it's not a chair. It's a...

367
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:31,693
...throne.

368
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:35,322
Throne.

369
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:39,660
[Ador finaan khal nevasoe... che khaleesi.]
A chair for a King to sit upon,

370
00:27:39,785 --> 00:27:41,411
Or...

371
00:27:41,537 --> 00:27:43,205
[...che khaleesi]
...a Queen.

372
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:54,206
[Khal vos zigereo adoroon anevasoe maan.]
A khal does not need a chair to sit upon.

373
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:57,010
[ Me zigeree sajosoon disse.]
He only needs a steed.

374
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:19,324
Can't you help me
make him understand?

375
00:28:19,408 --> 00:28:22,077
The Dothraki do things in their own time,
for their own reasons.

376
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:25,747
Have patience, Khaleesi.
We will go home, I promise you.

377
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:27,958
My brother was a fool, I know,

378
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,627
but he was the rightful heir
to the Seven Kingdoms.

379
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:34,131
Have I said something funny, ser?

380
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:37,176
Forgive me, Khaleesi,
but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror

381
00:28:37,301 --> 00:28:39,803
didn't seize six of the Kingdoms
because they were his right.

382
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:42,764
He had no right to them.
He seized them because he could.

383
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:44,308
And because he had dragons.

384
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:47,186
Ah, well, having a few dragons
makes things easier.

385
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:52,149
- You don't believe it.
- Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi?

386
00:28:52,232 --> 00:28:55,068
I believe what my eyes
and ears report.

387
00:28:55,152 --> 00:28:57,779
As for the rest...
it was 300 years ago.

388
00:28:57,905 --> 00:28:59,615
Who knows what really happened?

389
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,100
Now if you'll pardon me,
I'll seek out the merchant captain,

390
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:03,827
see if he has any letters for me.

391
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:06,663
- I'll come with you.
- No, no, don't trouble yourself.

392
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:09,666
Enjoy the market.
I'll rejoin you soon enough.

393
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:20,511
Psst! Jorah the Andal.

394
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:24,848
The Spider sends his greetings

395
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:27,059
and his congratulations.

396
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:32,022
A royal pardon.
You can go home now.

397
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:44,492
[Virzetha gizikhven! Mra qora! Mra qora!]
Sweet reds. I have it. I have it.

398
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:48,163
[Virzetha gizikhven!]
Sweet reds...

399
00:29:48,247 --> 00:29:54,878
[Virzethi gizikhven vekha m'anhoon, Lysoon, Volantisoon, ma Halahisiroon.]
I have sweet reds from Lys, Volantis and the Arbor!

400
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:57,830
[Sovikh Tirosh! Jelavena Andahloa.]
Tyroshi pear brandy! Andalish sours!

401
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,217
[Mra qora! Mra qora!]
I have them! I have them!

402
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:02,803
[Lekhi ha khaleesisaan?]
A taste for the Khaleesi?

403
00:30:03,512 --> 00:30:05,921
[M'anhoon vekha virzethi gizkhvena Dornoon, zhey erinak.]
I have a sweet red from Dorne, my lady.

404
00:30:05,931 --> 00:30:09,851
[At lekhi ma shafka ahakee yal hakesoon anni.]
One taste and you'll name your first child after me.

405
00:30:12,688 --> 00:30:15,888
My son already has his name,
but I'll try your summerwine.

406
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:17,234
Just a taste.

407
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,362
My lady, you are from Westeros.

408
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:23,407
You have the honour of addressing Daenerys
of the House Targaryen,

409
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:28,662
Khaleesi of the Riding Men
and Princess of the Seven Kingdoms.

410
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:30,747
- Princess.
- Rise.

411
00:30:30,873 --> 00:30:32,875
I'd still like to taste that wine.

412
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:36,211
That? Dornish swill.

413
00:30:36,378 --> 00:30:38,714
Not worthy of a princess.

414
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:41,091
I have a dry red from the Arbor.

415
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:43,135
Nectar of the gods.

416
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,929
Let me give you a cask.
A... a gift.

417
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:47,514
You honour me, ser.

418
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:50,017
The honour...
the honour is all mine.

419
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,935
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

420
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:58,817
You know, there are many in your homeland
that pray for your return, Princess.

421
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:00,569
I hope to repay
your kindness someday.

422
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:02,070
Rakharo.

423
00:31:02,196 --> 00:31:04,198
[Azzohi haz khogare.]
Put down that cask.

424
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,577
- Is something wrong?
- I have a thirst.

425
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:10,537
Open it.

426
00:31:10,621 --> 00:31:13,207
The wine is for the khaleesi.
It's not for the likes of you.

427
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:14,583
Open it.

428
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:27,763
Pour.

429
00:31:27,846 --> 00:31:29,890
It would be a crime
to drink a wine this rich...

430
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:33,018
- without at least giving it time to breathe.
- Do as he says.

431
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:35,687
As the princess commands.

432
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:50,202
Sweet, isn't it?

433
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:52,496
Can you smell the fruit, ser?

434
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,624
Taste it, my lord.

435
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:59,586
Tell me that that is not the finest wine
that has ever touched your tongue.

436
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:04,299
You first.

437
00:32:06,844 --> 00:32:08,387
Me?

438
00:32:08,512 --> 00:32:10,931
I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage.

439
00:32:11,056 --> 00:32:14,518
Besides, it is a poor wine merchant
who would drink up his own wares.

440
00:32:14,643 --> 00:32:16,353
You will drink.

441
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:34,872
Stop him!

442
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:50,053
Come.

443
00:32:57,186 --> 00:33:00,147
You came to us as outlaws...

444
00:33:00,189 --> 00:33:03,400
...poachers, rapers,

445
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:05,569
killers, thieves.

446
00:33:05,736 --> 00:33:09,323
You came alone, in chains,

447
00:33:09,448 --> 00:33:11,116
without friends

448
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,368
or honour.

449
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:16,914
You came to us rich
and you came to us poor.

450
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,416
Some of you bear the names

451
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:21,418
of proud Houses,

452
00:33:22,211 --> 00:33:25,214
others only bastard names
or no names at all.

453
00:33:25,297 --> 00:33:27,090
It does not matter.

454
00:33:27,216 --> 00:33:30,219
All that is in the past.

455
00:33:30,302 --> 00:33:32,262
Here...

456
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:35,349
on the Wall...

457
00:33:35,474 --> 00:33:37,851
we are all one House.

458
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:42,272
- Tonight...
- You're allowed to look happy.

459
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:46,151
You're going to be a ranger.

460
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:48,403
Isn't that what you always wanted?

461
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:50,906
I want to find my uncle.

462
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:55,244
I know he's alive out there.
I know he is.

463
00:33:56,578 --> 00:34:00,290
I wish I could help you,
but I'm no ranger.

464
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:02,376
It's the steward's life for me.

465
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,504
There's honour in being a steward.

466
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:08,006
Not much, really.

467
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:09,591
But there's food.

468
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:17,474
Here... you begin anew.

469
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:27,484
A man of the Night's Watch...

470
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:31,989
lives his life for the realm.

471
00:34:33,574 --> 00:34:35,409
Not for a king...

472
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:38,328
or a lord, or the honour of this House

473
00:34:38,412 --> 00:34:40,789
or that House,

474
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:43,667
not for gold or glory,

475
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:46,128
or a woman's love,

476
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:48,213
but for the realm

477
00:34:48,297 --> 00:34:51,008
and all the people in it.

478
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:54,595
You've all learned
the words of the vow.

479
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,681
Think carefully before you say them.

480
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:00,601
The penalty for desertion...

481
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:03,061
is death.

482
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:10,861
You can take your vows here...

483
00:35:10,986 --> 00:35:12,696
tonight...

484
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:14,114
at sunset.

485
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:17,451
Do any of you still keep the old gods?

486
00:35:19,745 --> 00:35:21,580
I do, my lord.

487
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:25,083
You'll want to take your vow
before a heart tree as your uncle did.

488
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:26,251
Yes, my lord.

489
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:29,254
You'll find a weirwood
a mile north of the Wall.

490
00:35:29,379 --> 00:35:32,174
And your old gods too, maybe.

491
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,261
My lord, might I go as well?

492
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:38,222
Does House Tarly keep the old gods?

493
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:40,641
No, my lord.

494
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,310
I was named in the light of the Seven,

495
00:35:43,393 --> 00:35:45,938
as my father was
and his father before him.

496
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:49,942
Why would you forsake the gods
of your father and your House?

497
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:54,196
The Night's Watch is my House now.

498
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:56,823
The Seven have never answered my prayers.

499
00:35:58,075 --> 00:36:00,244
Perhaps the old gods will.

500
00:36:01,578 --> 00:36:03,080
As you wish, lad.

501
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:07,042
You've all been assigned an order,

502
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:09,962
according to our needs

503
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:11,755
and your strengths.

504
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:14,716
Halder to the builders.

505
00:36:15,717 --> 00:36:17,469
Pyp to the stewards.

506
00:36:17,594 --> 00:36:20,430
Toad to the builders.
Grenn to the rangers.

507
00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:22,474
Samwell to the stewards.

508
00:36:22,558 --> 00:36:26,144
Matthar to the rangers.
Dareon to the stewards.

509
00:36:26,228 --> 00:36:28,230
Balian to the rangers.

510
00:36:28,272 --> 00:36:29,857
Rast to the rangers.

511
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:31,567
Jon to the stewards.

512
00:36:31,692 --> 00:36:33,402
Rancer to the builder.

513
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:36,405
Echiel to the builders.
Gordo to the stewards.

514
00:36:36,488 --> 00:36:39,867
Niko to the rangers.
Escan to the rangers.

515
00:36:39,992 --> 00:36:42,995
Vorkoy to the builders.
Joby to the stables.

516
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,331
Mink to the kitchens.
Allo to the builders.

517
00:36:46,415 --> 00:36:48,750
Nelugo to the rangers.

518
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:52,379
May all the gods preserve you.

519
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:59,678
Rangers with me.

520
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:02,306
Builders!

521
00:37:21,325 --> 00:37:25,871
Samwell, you will assist me
in the rookery and library.

522
00:37:25,996 --> 00:37:29,917
Pyp, you will report
to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens.

523
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:34,713
Luke, report to One-Eyed Joe
in the stables.

524
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:38,675
Dareon, we are sending you
to Eastwatch.

525
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:41,595
Present yourself to Borcas
when you arrive.

526
00:37:41,637 --> 00:37:44,848
Make no comment about his nose.

527
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:49,102
Jon Snow,
Lord Commander Mormont

528
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:52,189
has requested you
for his personal steward.

529
00:37:53,774 --> 00:37:56,902
Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals
and fetch hot water for his bath?

530
00:37:57,069 --> 00:38:00,781
Certainly. And keep a fire burning
in his chambers,

531
00:38:00,906 --> 00:38:03,700
change his sheets
and blankets daily

532
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:07,496
and do everything else
the Lord Commander requires of you.

533
00:38:10,582 --> 00:38:12,042
Do you take me for a servant?

534
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:14,753
We took you for a man
of the Night's Watch.

535
00:38:14,837 --> 00:38:17,673
But perhaps we were wrong in that.

536
00:38:18,632 --> 00:38:21,343
- May I go?
- As you wish.

537
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:31,103
Jon, wait! Don't you see
what they're doing?

538
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:33,105
I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all.

539
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,982
He wanted it and he got it.

540
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:37,568
Stewards are nothing but maids!

541
00:38:37,693 --> 00:38:39,695
I'm a better swordsman
and rider than any of you!

542
00:38:39,862 --> 00:38:42,823
- It's not fair.
- Fair?

543
00:38:43,615 --> 00:38:45,909
I was singing for a high lord
at Acorn Hall

544
00:38:46,034 --> 00:38:48,954
when he put his hand on my leg
and he wanted to see my cock.

545
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:52,875
I pushed him away and he said he'd have
my hands cut off for stealing their silver.

546
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:54,793
So now I'm here -
at the end of the world

547
00:38:54,918 --> 00:38:57,671
with no one to sing for
but old men and little shits like you.

548
00:38:57,754 --> 00:38:59,673
I'll never see my family again.

549
00:38:59,798 --> 00:39:01,884
I'll never be inside a woman again.

550
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:03,135
So don't tell me about fair.

551
00:39:03,302 --> 00:39:07,055
I thought you were caught stealing
a wheel of cheese for your starving sister.

552
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:11,268
Think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers
that a high lord tried to grab my cock?

553
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:17,399
Could you sing me a song, Pyp?
I'd like to hear a song.

554
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:24,198
Now listen to me.

555
00:39:24,323 --> 00:39:27,576
The old man is the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

556
00:39:27,743 --> 00:39:29,494
You'll be with him day and night.

557
00:39:29,578 --> 00:39:32,080
Yes, you'll clean his clothes.

558
00:39:32,164 --> 00:39:36,001
But you'll also take his letters,
attend him at meetings,

559
00:39:36,168 --> 00:39:38,003
squire for him in battle.

560
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:41,715
You'll know everything,
be part of everything.

561
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:43,425
And he asked for you himself.

562
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:47,262
He wants to groom you for command.

563
00:39:52,851 --> 00:39:54,019
I just...

564
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:57,064
I always wanted to be a ranger.

565
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:01,318
I always wanted to be a wizard.

566
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,697
What?

567
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:08,033
No, I'm serious.

568
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:10,702
So you'll stay
and say your words with me?

569
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:20,546
Lord Stark... a moment.

570
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:23,757
Alone, if you will.

571
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:35,394
He named you Protector of the Realm.

572
00:40:37,187 --> 00:40:38,647
He did.

573
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:40,399
She won't care.

574
00:40:40,482 --> 00:40:43,944
Give me an hour and I can put
a hundred swords at your command.

575
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:45,821
And what should I do
with a hundred swords?

576
00:40:45,988 --> 00:40:49,783
Strike! Tonight, while the castle sleeps.

577
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:53,328
We must get Joffrey away from his mother
and into our custody.

578
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:57,249
Protector of the Realm or no,
he who holds the king holds the kingdom.

579
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:01,420
Every moment you delay gives Cersei
another moment to prepare.

580
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:04,423
By the time Robert dies,
it will be too late for the both of us.

581
00:41:04,506 --> 00:41:06,300
What about Stannis?

582
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:09,636
Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei
and delivering them to Stannis?

583
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:12,431
You have odd notions
about protecting the realm.

584
00:41:12,598 --> 00:41:14,183
Stannis is your older brother.

585
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:16,435
This isn't about the bloody
line of succession.

586
00:41:16,518 --> 00:41:20,647
That didn't matter when you rebelled
against the Mad King. It shouldn't matter now.

587
00:41:22,608 --> 00:41:24,735
What's best for the Kingdoms?

588
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:27,738
What's best for the people we rule?

589
00:41:28,906 --> 00:41:31,408
We all know what Stannis is.

590
00:41:31,533 --> 00:41:34,786
He inspires no love or loyalty.

591
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,580
He's not a king.

592
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:39,291
I am.

593
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:47,883
Stannis is a commander.

594
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:51,136
He's led men into war twice.

595
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:52,971
He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet.

596
00:41:53,096 --> 00:41:55,891
Yes, he's a good soldier.
Everyone knows that. So was Robert.

597
00:41:57,226 --> 00:41:58,310
Tell me something.

598
00:41:58,435 --> 00:42:00,812
Do you still believe good soldiers
make good kings?

599
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:11,281
I will not dishonour Robert's last hours
by shedding blood in his halls...

600
00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:13,825
and dragging frightened children
from their beds.

601
00:42:27,464 --> 00:42:30,133
You will sail to Dragonstone tonight.

602
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,886
You will place this in the hand
of Stannis Baratheon.

603
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:36,348
Not his steward...

604
00:42:37,307 --> 00:42:39,768
not his captain of the guard...

605
00:42:39,852 --> 00:42:42,145
and not his wife.

606
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,861
Only Stannis himself.

607
00:42:48,986 --> 00:42:51,864
Yes, my lord.

608
00:42:54,324 --> 00:42:55,576
Now leave us.

609
00:43:05,002 --> 00:43:07,379
My Lord Protector.

610
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:14,970
The king has no trueborn sons.

611
00:43:16,013 --> 00:43:17,556
Joffrey and Tommen...

612
00:43:17,723 --> 00:43:19,600
are Jaime Lannister's bastards.

613
00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:25,105
- So when the king dies...
- The throne passes to his brother...

614
00:43:26,648 --> 00:43:28,025
Lord Stannis.

615
00:43:28,984 --> 00:43:30,360
So it would seem.

616
00:43:32,196 --> 00:43:34,448
- Unless...
- There is no "unless".

617
00:43:34,573 --> 00:43:36,867
He is the rightful heir.
Nothing can change that.

618
00:43:37,034 --> 00:43:39,077
And he cannot take the throne
without your help.

619
00:43:39,203 --> 00:43:43,207
You would be wise to deny it to him
and to make sure Joffrey succeeds.

620
00:43:46,168 --> 00:43:48,879
Do you have a shred of honour?

621
00:43:49,046 --> 00:43:52,799
You are now Hand of the King
and Protector of the Realm.

622
00:43:52,883 --> 00:43:55,093
All of the power is yours.
You need only...

623
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,721
reach out and take it.

624
00:43:57,888 --> 00:43:59,932
Make peace with the Lannisters.

625
00:44:00,057 --> 00:44:03,477
Release the Imp.
Wed your daughter to Joffrey.

626
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:06,313
We've plenty of time to get rid of Stannis,

627
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:09,858
and if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems
when he comes into his throne,

628
00:44:09,983 --> 00:44:12,236
we simply reveal his little secret

629
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:15,447
- and seat Lord Renly there instead.
- We?

630
00:44:15,614 --> 00:44:19,368
You'll need someone to share these burdens,
I assure you.

631
00:44:19,493 --> 00:44:21,537
My price would be modest.

632
00:44:22,412 --> 00:44:24,665
What you suggest is treason.

633
00:44:24,748 --> 00:44:26,875
Only if we lose.

634
00:44:29,545 --> 00:44:32,214
Make peace with the Lannisters,
you say...

635
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:35,801
with the people who tried to murder my boy.

636
00:44:35,968 --> 00:44:39,388
We only make peace
with our enemies, my lord.

637
00:44:39,555 --> 00:44:41,723
That's why it's called "making peace".

638
00:44:41,807 --> 00:44:45,060
No. I won't do it.

639
00:44:45,853 --> 00:44:47,688
So it will be Stannis and war?

640
00:44:47,729 --> 00:44:49,982
There is no other choice.

641
00:44:50,899 --> 00:44:52,442
He is the heir.

642
00:44:53,443 --> 00:44:55,028
So why did you call me here?

643
00:44:55,195 --> 00:44:57,239
Not for my wisdom, clearly.

644
00:44:58,866 --> 00:45:00,951
You promised Catelyn
you would help me.

645
00:45:01,076 --> 00:45:03,871
The queen has a dozen knights
and a hundred men-at-arms -

646
00:45:03,954 --> 00:45:07,833
enough to overwhelm what remains
of my household guard.

647
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:09,751
I need the gold cloaks.

648
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:13,046
The City Watch is 2,000 strong...

649
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:16,300
and sworn to defend the king's peace.

650
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:20,762
Look at you.

651
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:23,932
You know what you want me to do,

652
00:45:24,016 --> 00:45:26,059
you know it has to be done,

653
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,270
but it's not honourable, so...

654
00:45:28,979 --> 00:45:30,772
the words stick in your throat.

655
00:45:31,523 --> 00:45:33,901
When the queen proclaims one king

656
00:45:33,984 --> 00:45:35,736
and the Hand proclaims another,

657
00:45:35,861 --> 00:45:38,530
whose peace do the gold cloaks protect?

658
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,117
Who do they follow?

659
00:45:47,164 --> 00:45:49,041
The man who pays them.

660
00:46:34,336 --> 00:46:38,799
Hear my words
and bear witness to my vow.

661
00:46:38,966 --> 00:46:42,344
Night gathers
and now my watch begins.

662
00:46:42,386 --> 00:46:45,639
It shall not end until my death.

663
00:46:45,764 --> 00:46:48,016
I shall take no wife,

664
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,103
hold no lands,
father no children.

665
00:46:51,645 --> 00:46:55,315
I shall wear no crowns
and win no glory.

666
00:46:55,399 --> 00:46:59,069
I shall live and die at my post.

667
00:46:59,152 --> 00:47:02,072
I am the sword in the darkness.

668
00:47:02,155 --> 00:47:04,825
I am the watcher on the walls.

669
00:47:04,992 --> 00:47:08,871
I am the shield that guards
the realms of men.

670
00:47:08,996 --> 00:47:12,833
I pledge my life and honour
to the Night's Watch,

671
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,795
for this night
and all the nights to come.

672
00:47:16,962 --> 00:47:19,047
You knelt as boys.

673
00:47:19,173 --> 00:47:21,633
Rise now as men of the Night's Watch.

674
00:47:35,022 --> 00:47:36,773
Well done. Well done.

675
00:47:43,697 --> 00:47:45,532
What's he got there?

676
00:47:45,657 --> 00:47:48,660
To me, Ghost.
Bring it here.

677
00:47:50,787 --> 00:47:53,165
Gods be good!

678
00:47:59,755 --> 00:48:01,757
What will they do to him?

679
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:07,221
When the khalasar rides,
he'll be leashed to a saddle

680
00:48:07,304 --> 00:48:10,891
and forced to run behind the horses
for as long as he can.

681
00:48:10,974 --> 00:48:12,851
And when he falls?

682
00:48:14,144 --> 00:48:17,022
I saw a man last nine miles once.

683
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:20,901
King Robert still wants me dead.

684
00:48:20,984 --> 00:48:23,278
This poisoner was the first.
He won't be the last.

685
00:48:23,403 --> 00:48:27,241
I thought he'd leave me alone
now that my brother is gone.

686
00:48:27,366 --> 00:48:29,993
He will never leave you alone.

687
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,413
If you ride to darkest Asshai,
his assassins will follow you.

688
00:48:33,497 --> 00:48:35,958
If you sailed all the way
to the Basilisk Isles,

689
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:37,334
his spies would tell him.

690
00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:40,462
He will never abandon the hunt.

691
00:48:40,587 --> 00:48:44,466
You're a Targaryen -
the last Targaryen.

692
00:48:44,591 --> 00:48:46,635
Your son will have Targaryen blood

693
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,304
with 40,000 riders behind him.

694
00:48:50,931 --> 00:48:52,683
He will not have my son.

695
00:48:53,725 --> 00:48:55,644
He will not have you either, Khaleesi.

696
00:49:28,594 --> 00:49:30,512
[Zhey jalan atthirari anni.]
Moon of my life.

697
00:49:31,096 --> 00:49:32,598
[Hash azisi?]
Are you hurt?

698
00:49:43,483 --> 00:49:45,027
[Jora Andahli, ]
Jorah the Andal,

699
00:49:45,152 --> 00:49:47,905
[okki zhille hrazef.]
I heard what you did.

700
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:51,575
[Fin allayafa shafka drogikhoon anni, me shafki.]
Choose any horse you wish, it is yours.

701
00:49:55,662 --> 00:49:59,750
[Anha asshilak jin azh shafkea haji rekoon et shafka.]
I make this gift to you for what you did.

702
00:50:05,088 --> 00:50:09,968
[Ma rizhaan anni, vezh fin asaja rhaesheseres, ]
And to my son, the stallion who will mount the world,

703
00:50:10,093 --> 00:50:13,555
[maan anha valloshak azh akka.]
I will also pledge a gift.

704
00:50:13,639 --> 00:50:17,851
[Maan anha vazhak jin ador shiqethi...]
I will give him the iron chair...

705
00:50:17,976 --> 00:50:21,980
[...finaan neva ave maisi mae.]
...that his mother's father sat upon.

706
00:50:22,814 --> 00:50:27,134
[Anha vazhak maan Rhaeshis Andahli.]
I will give The Lands of the Andals. (I will give him Seven Kingdoms)

707
00:50:27,402 --> 00:50:31,949
[Anha, zhey Drogo, atak jin.]
I, Drogo, will do this.

708
00:50:32,491 --> 00:50:35,901
[Anha vidrik khalasares anni jim finaan nakhoe rhaesheser...]
I will take my Khalasar west to where the world ends...

709
00:50:35,911 --> 00:50:41,416
[majin adothrak hrazef ido yomme Havazzhifi Kazga...]
...and ride wooden horses across the black salt water...

710
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:45,045
[ven et vo khal avvos.]
...as no Khal has done before.

711
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:51,760
[Anha vaddrivak mahrazhis fini ondee khogar shiqethi...]
I will kill the men in iron suits...

712
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:55,245
[...ma vohharak okrenegwin mori.]
...and tear down their stone houses.

713
00:50:57,266 --> 00:51:01,061
[Anha aqorisok chiories mori...]
I will rape their women...

714
00:51:01,186 --> 00:51:03,689
[vazzafrok yal mori...]
...take their children as slaves...

715
00:51:03,814 --> 00:51:07,694
[...ma afichak vojjor samva Vaesaan Dothrak.]
...and bring their broken gods back to Vaes Dothrak.

716
00:51:10,863 --> 00:51:12,906
[Ki jini anha astak asqoy...]
This, I vow...

717
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:15,951
[anha, Drogo ki Bharbosi.]
...l, Drogo, son of Bharbo.

718
00:51:17,536 --> 00:51:22,332
[Ki jini anha astak asqoy hatif Maisi Krazaaji]
I swear before the Mother of Mountains...

719
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:25,456
[...kash shieraki vitihiri asavvasoon.]
...as the stars look down in witness.

720
00:51:26,003 --> 00:51:28,922
[Kash shieraki vitihiri asavvasoon.]
As the stars look down in witness.

721
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,037
Lord Stark!

722
00:52:00,162 --> 00:52:02,039
- Stop!
- No, all right.

723
00:52:02,164 --> 00:52:03,999
It's all right.
Let him through.

724
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:07,753
Lord Stark, King Joffrey and the Queen Regent
request your presence in the Throne Room.

725
00:52:07,878 --> 00:52:09,630
King Joffrey?

726
00:52:09,755 --> 00:52:11,215
King Robert is gone.

727
00:52:11,298 --> 00:52:13,509
The gods give him rest.

728
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:27,564
All is accomplished.
The City Watch is yours.

729
00:52:27,689 --> 00:52:29,358
Good.

730
00:52:30,108 --> 00:52:32,152
Is Lord Renly joining us?

731
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:36,657
I fear Lord Renly has left the city.

732
00:52:37,407 --> 00:52:40,702
He rode through the Old Gate
an hour before dawn

733
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:44,706
with Ser Loras Tyrell
and some 50 retainers.

734
00:52:44,831 --> 00:52:48,335
Last seen galloping south
in some haste.

735
00:53:09,147 --> 00:53:11,233
We stand behind you, Lord Stark.

736
00:53:20,659 --> 00:53:22,411
All hail His Grace,

737
00:53:22,494 --> 00:53:25,372
Joffrey of Houses Baratheon
and Lannister

738
00:53:25,414 --> 00:53:27,124
the First of His Name,

739
00:53:27,249 --> 00:53:29,459
King of the Andals and the First Men,

740
00:53:29,501 --> 00:53:31,837
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

741
00:53:32,004 --> 00:53:35,048
and Protector of the Realm.

742
00:53:52,983 --> 00:53:56,862
I command the council to make all necessary
arrangements for my coronation.

743
00:53:57,029 --> 00:53:59,573
I wish to be crowned within the fortnight.

744
00:53:59,656 --> 00:54:02,492
Today I shall accept oaths of fealty

745
00:54:02,618 --> 00:54:04,494
from my loyal councillors.

746
00:54:08,248 --> 00:54:09,750
Ser Barristan...

747
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:13,378
I believe no man here
could ever question your honour.

748
00:54:24,723 --> 00:54:28,143
King Robert's seal - unbroken.

749
00:54:35,651 --> 00:54:39,071
"Lord Eddard Stark is herein named...

750
00:54:39,238 --> 00:54:40,989
"Protector of the Realm...

751
00:54:42,115 --> 00:54:44,034
"to rule as regent...

752
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:46,787
"until the heir come of age."

753
00:54:47,996 --> 00:54:50,207
May I see that letter, Ser Barristan?

754
00:54:58,757 --> 00:55:00,342
Protector of the Realm.

755
00:55:04,763 --> 00:55:07,474
Is this meant to be your shield, Lord Stark?

756
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,143
A piece of paper?

757
00:55:13,313 --> 00:55:16,358
- Those were the king's words.
- We have a new king now.

758
00:55:19,069 --> 00:55:22,322
Lord Eddard, when we last spoke
you offered me some counsel.

759
00:55:23,448 --> 00:55:25,701
Allow me to return the courtesy.

760
00:55:25,784 --> 00:55:27,995
Bend the knee, my lord.

761
00:55:28,078 --> 00:55:31,039
Bend the knee
and swear loyalty to my son...

762
00:55:31,874 --> 00:55:34,334
and we shall allow you
to live out your days

763
00:55:34,459 --> 00:55:37,087
in the grey waste you call home.

764
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:39,423
Your son has no claim to the throne.

765
00:55:39,548 --> 00:55:40,757
Liar!

766
00:55:40,841 --> 00:55:43,760
You condemn yourself
with your own mouth, Lord Stark.

767
00:55:43,886 --> 00:55:45,721
Ser Barristan, seize this traitor.

768
00:55:47,556 --> 00:55:50,475
Ser Barristan is a good man,
a loyal man. Do him no harm.

769
00:55:53,145 --> 00:55:54,479
You think he stands alone?

770
00:55:57,816 --> 00:56:00,861
Kill him! Kill all of them!
I command it!

771
00:56:00,986 --> 00:56:05,032
Commander!
Take the queen and her children into custody.

772
00:56:05,157 --> 00:56:09,286
Escort them back to the royal apartments
and keep them there, under guard.

773
00:56:09,411 --> 00:56:11,205
Men of the Watch!

774
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:17,711
I want no bloodshed.

775
00:56:17,836 --> 00:56:20,339
Tell your men to lay down their swords.

776
00:56:20,464 --> 00:56:22,424
No one needs to die.

777
00:56:24,218 --> 00:56:26,261
Now!

778
00:56:36,772 --> 00:56:39,441
I did warn you not to trust me.

779
00:56:41,872 --> 00:56:46,441
WHAT THE FUCK LITTLEFINGER?!?!
Sync, corrected & Dothraki dialogue by <font color="#3333FF">MALAY DEV</font>

780
00:56:50,872 --> 00:56:54,872
My Dothraki dialogue follows closely to it's translations
No sugarcoatings. It is as it is spoken.

00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:59,828
Yah! Left high, left low.

4
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:19,556
Right low, lunge right.

5
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,395
You break anything,
the septa will have my head.

6
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:27,940
What is...

7
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,036
Your sister knew perfectly well
we were to leave today.

8
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,247
- How she could forget...
- She didn't forget.

9
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,916
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.

10
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,752
She always comes back with scrapes
and bruises. She's so clumsy.

11
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,088
Hush!

12
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,715
Go back to your room.

13
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:57,261
Bar the doors and do not open them
for anyone you do not know.

14
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:00,305
- What is it? What's happening?
- Do as I told you.

15
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,432
Run!

16
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,688
This way!

17
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,620
Left, right. Rah!

18
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,957
- Now you are dead.
- You said right,

19
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,750
but you went left.

20
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:32,504
- And now you are a dead girl.
- Only 'cause you lied.

21
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:36,758
My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.

22
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:40,137
- You were not seeing.
- I was so. I watched, but you...

23
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:44,391
Watching is not seeing, dead girl.

24
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:50,147
The seeing, the true seeing,

25
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,649
that is the heart of swordplay.

26
00:03:57,112 --> 00:04:01,033
Arya Stark, come with us.
Your father wants to see you.

27
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:07,331
And why is it that Lord Eddard
is sending Lannister men

28
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,041
in place of his own?

29
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,669
- I am wondering.
- Mind your place, dancing master.

30
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:16,965
- This is no concern of yours.
- My father wouldn't send you.

31
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,305
And I don't have to go
with you if I don't want.

32
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,682
Take her.

33
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:29,686
Are you men or snakes,
that you would threaten a child?

34
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,939
Get out of my way, little man.

35
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:35,317
I am Syrio Forel...

36
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,277
Foreign bastard.

37
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:43,867
...and you will be speaking to me
with more respect.

38
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,329
Kill the Braavosi. Bring the girl.

39
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:51,708
Arya child, we are done
with dancing for the day.

40
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,294
Run to your father.

41
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,858
Bloody oafs.

42
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:21,071
- Begone now, Arya.
- Come with me. Run.

43
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,701
The first sword of Braavos does not run.

44
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:39,840
What do we say

45
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,467
to the god of death?

46
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,303
Not today.

47
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:48,056
Go.

48
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,291
Not today. Not today.

49
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:27,513
Stay away from me.
I'll tell my father.

50
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,349
I'll... I'll tell the queen.

51
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:34,061
Who do you think sent me?

52
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,159
Needle.

53
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,705
There she is.

54
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:56,124
- What do you want?
- I want you, wolf girl.

55
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,835
- Come here.
- Leave me be.

56
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,630
- My father's a lord. He'll reward you.
- She'll reward me - the queen!

57
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,299
Stay away!

58
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:36,331
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.

59
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,002
Varys.

60
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,256
I promise you it isn't poisoned.

61
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,468
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?

62
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,395
Not so much, my lord.

63
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,689
I would save the rest, if I were you.

64
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:04,651
Hide it. Men have been known
to die of thirst in these cells.

65
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,697
What about my daughters?

66
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,200
The younger one seems
to have escaped the castle.

67
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:13,911
Even my little birds cannot find her.

68
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:17,247
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.

69
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:21,251
Cersei will keep her close.
The rest of your household though...

70
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:25,214
all dead, it grieves me to say.
I do so hate the sight of blood.

71
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,718
You watched my men
being slaughtered and did nothing.

72
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,137
And would again, my lord.

73
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:36,433
I was unarmed, unarmoured
and surrounded by Lannister swords.

74
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:39,686
When you look at me
do you see a hero?

75
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,236
What madness led you to tell the queen

76
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:50,864
you had learned the truth
about Joffrey's birth?

77
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,201
The madness of mercy.

78
00:08:56,995 --> 00:09:00,624
- That she might save her children.
- Ah, the children.

79
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:03,919
It's always
the innocents who suffer.

80
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,130
It wasn't the wine
that killed Robert, nor the boar.

81
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:10,592
The wine slowed him down
and the boar ripped him open,

82
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:14,096
but it was your mercy
that killed the king.

83
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:20,853
I trust you know you're
a dead man, Lord Eddard?

84
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:29,736
The queen can't kill me.
Cat holds her brother.

85
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,366
The wrong brother, sadly.
And lost to her.

86
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:37,369
Your wife has let the Imp
slip through her fingers.

87
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,750
If that's true,

88
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,921
then slit my throat
and be done with it.

89
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,048
Not today, my lord.

90
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,804
Tell me something, Varys.

91
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,640
Who do you truly serve?

92
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,519
The realm, my lord.

93
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,646
Someone must.

94
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,668
It's Othor, without a doubt.

95
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:32,216
The other one is Jafer Flowers, my lord,
less the hand the wolf tore off.

96
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:35,761
Any sign of Benjen
or the rest of his party?

97
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:39,848
Just these two, my lord.
Been dead awhile, I'd say.

98
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:42,601
- Mmm.
- The smell.

99
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,647
What smell?

100
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,734
There is none.

101
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:54,530
If they'd been dead for a long time,
wouldn't there be rot?

102
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:59,535
- We should burn them.
- Snow's not wrong, my lord.

103
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:01,870
Fire will do for them.
The wildling way.

104
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:05,499
I want Maester Aemon
to examine them first.

105
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,671
You may be a coward, Tarly,
but you're not stupid.

106
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:14,675
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.

107
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,001
Lord Commander!

108
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,807
Maester Aemon
awaits you in his chambers...

109
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:24,685
A raven from King's Landing.

110
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,312
Come on, move 'em out.

111
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,742
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow,

112
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,037
and pour one for yourself.

113
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:56,425
The king is dead.

114
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:11,064
Is there any word of my father?

115
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,192
Sit.

116
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:20,449
Lord Stark has been

117
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,284
charged with treason.

118
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:26,163
They say he conspired
with Robert's brothers

119
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:29,208
to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.

120
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:44,264
I hope you're not thinking
of doing anything stupid.

121
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:47,809
Your duty lies here now.

122
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:50,771
My sisters were in King's Landing too.

123
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,275
I'm sure they'll be

124
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:57,069
treated gently.

125
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:04,076
Your father has proved to be
an awful traitor, dear.

126
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:07,079
King Robert's body was still warm

127
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:11,291
when Lord Eddard began plotting
to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.

128
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,877
He wouldn't do that.

129
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:16,672
He knows how much
I love Joffrey. He wouldn't.

130
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:19,716
Please, Your Grace,
there's been a mistake.

131
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:23,387
Send for my father. He'll tell you -
the king was his friend.

132
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:27,391
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent
of any wrong. We know that.

133
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:29,977
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.

134
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,354
How can I allow you to marry my son?

135
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,357
A child born of a traitor's seed

136
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,776
is no fit consort for our king.

137
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,362
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace,

138
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:44,908
but in 10 years who knows
what treasons she may hatch?

139
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:48,036
No, I'm not. I'll be
a good wife to him, you'll see.

140
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,541
I'll be a queen just like you, I promise.
I won't hatch anything.

141
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:56,253
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.

142
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,382
She should be given a chance
to prove her loyalty.

143
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:11,059
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn
and your brother, the eldest,

144
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:13,770
- what's his name?
- Robb.

145
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:17,024
Word of your father's arrest
will reach him soon, no doubt.

146
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:21,278
Best it comes from you.
If you would help your father,

147
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:24,615
urge your brother
to keep the king's peace.

148
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,784
Tell him to come to King's Landing
and swear his fealty to Joffrey.

149
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:38,086
If... If I could see my father,
talk to him about...

150
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,090
You disappoint me, child.

151
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,594
We have told you
of your father's treason.

152
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,930
Why would you want
to speak to a traitor?

153
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,933
I only meant that...

154
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,228
What will happen to him?

155
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:58,232
- That depends.
- On...

156
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:01,944
- On what?
- On your brother.

157
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,949
And on you.

158
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:17,084
Treason?

159
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,670
Sansa wrote this?

160
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:22,172
It is your sister's hand,
but the queen's words.

161
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:26,260
You are summoned to King's Landing
to swear fealty to the new king.

162
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:29,471
Joffrey puts my father in chains,
now he wants his arse kissed?

163
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,475
This is a royal command, my lord.

164
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,271
- If you should refuse to obey...
- I won't refuse.

165
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:41,358
His Grace summons me to King's Landing,
I'll go to King's Landing.

166
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,361
But not alone.

167
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,240
Call the banners.

168
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,702
All of them, my lord?

169
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:53,777
They've all sworn to defend my father,
have they not?

170
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,664
They have.

171
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,916
Now we see
what their words are worth.

172
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:01,170
Yes.

173
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,805
Are you afraid?

174
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,685
I must be.

175
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,228
Good.

176
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,941
- Why is that good?
- It means you're not stupid.

177
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:48,217
You've had this since dawn?

178
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:51,720
He sent it to me, not you.

179
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:56,058
- I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
- A courtesy?!

180
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:58,268
My husband has been taken prisoner.

181
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:01,772
- My son intends to declare war.
- A war?

182
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,233
Your son against the Lannisters?

183
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:08,779
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.

184
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:12,032
Ned rots in a dungeon
and you speak of patience?

185
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:14,660
He is your brother by law!

186
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:17,746
Does family mean nothing to you?

187
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:20,624
Family means everything to me.

188
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:22,501
And I will not risk Robin's life

189
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:25,295
to get caught up in another
of your husband's wars.

190
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,590
- I'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.

191
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,551
You just ate.

192
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:33,470
You will not support us, then?
Do I understand you correctly?

193
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:37,266
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.

194
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:41,436
You're always welcome here, sister.

195
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:44,690
But if you're asking me
to send men from the Vale to fight...

196
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:46,942
That is what I ask.

197
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:50,904
Go on, sweet.

198
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,031
Time for your bath.

199
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:55,576
I'll feed you after.

200
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:02,124
If you fear for the safety of your son...

201
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,252
Of course I fear
for the safety of my son!

202
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:07,296
Are you an idiot?

203
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:09,798
They killed my husband.

204
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,301
You say they shoved
your boy from a window.

205
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:16,930
- These people will do anything.
- And that is why we have to stop them.

206
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:23,520
The knights of the Vale
will stay in the Vale

207
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:25,230
where they belong,

208
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:27,524
to protect their lord.

209
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:43,081
Will you shut up?

210
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:48,170
There's hill tribes all around here.

211
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:53,133
If I'm going to die, it may as well be
with a song in my heart.

212
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:56,595
I should just take your food
and leave you here.

213
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,305
Eh?

214
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:02,351
- What would you do then?
- Starve, most likely.

215
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:05,103
You don't think I'd do it, do you?

216
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:09,650
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold? Women?

217
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:11,735
Golden women?

218
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:14,071
Stick with me and you'll have them all,

219
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:17,282
for as long as I'm around
and not a moment longer.

220
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:20,244
But you knew that.

221
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:24,331
That is why you so valiantly
took up arms to defend my honour.

222
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,584
Fair enough.

223
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,587
But don't go looking
for me to bend the knee

224
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:33,882
and "my lord" you
every time you take a shit.

225
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:37,511
I'm not your toady
and I'm not your friend.

226
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:39,847
Though I would treasure
your friendship,

227
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:43,141
I'm mainly interested
in your facility with murder.

228
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:45,894
And if the day ever comes
when you're tempted to sell me out,

229
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,604
remember this -

230
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:49,356
whatever their price,

231
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,024
I'll beat it.

232
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:53,193
I like living.

233
00:19:57,573 --> 00:20:00,993
Tyrion.

234
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:04,496
Tyrion.

235
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,377
Tyrion.

236
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,234
Come, share our fire.

237
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,571
Help yourselves to our goat.

238
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,121
When you meet your gods,
you tell them

239
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:51,835
Shagga, son of Dolf,
of the Stone Crows sent you.

240
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,130
I am Tyrion, son of Tywin
of Clan Lannister.

241
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:58,300
How would you like to die,
Tyrion, son of Tywin?

242
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:03,180
In my own bed,
at the age of 8O

243
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:05,849
with a belly full of wine
and a girl's mouth around my cock.

244
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:13,565
Take the halfman.

245
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:16,610
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.

246
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:18,904
No, no, no, no, no!

247
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,990
My... My house is rich and powerful.

248
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:26,161
If you see us through these mountains,
my father will shower you with gold.

249
00:21:26,245 --> 00:21:28,705
We have no use
for a halfman's promises.

250
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:33,168
Halfman maybe, but at least I have
the courage to face my enemies.

251
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:37,130
What do the Stone Crows do?
Hide behind rocks and shiver

252
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:39,716
when the knights
of the Vale ride by?

253
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,803
Are those the best weapons
you could steal?

254
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:47,808
Good enough for killing sheep,
if the sheep don't fight back.

255
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:49,977
Lannister smiths shit better steel.

256
00:21:55,858 --> 00:21:59,069
You think you can win us over
with your trinkets?

257
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:14,334
That trinket is worth more
than everything your tribe owns.

258
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:18,922
But if you help us,
Shagga, son of Dolf,

259
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:21,216
I will not give you trinkets.

260
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:23,844
I will give you this.

261
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:26,305
What is "this"?

262
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:30,017
The Vale of Arryn.

263
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,353
The lords of the Vale
have always spat upon the hill tribes.

264
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:37,649
The lords of the Vale want me dead.

265
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,362
I believe it is time
for new lords of the Vale.

266
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:52,247
Now there's a rare sight...

267
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:56,335
Not only a bastard,
but a traitor's bastard.

268
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:09,389
- Jon, no!
- Jon, stop, put it down!

269
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:14,937
Blood will always tell.

270
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:18,023
You'll hang for this, bastard.

271
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:40,671
I told you not to do anything stupid.

272
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:44,132
You're confined to quarters. Go.

273
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:10,826
Ghost, what's wrong?

274
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:14,830
Is someone out there?

275
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:48,238
Commander?

276
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:54,077
Stay.

277
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:07,841
Hello?

278
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,977
Who's there?

279
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,569
Lord Commander?

280
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:55,806
Snow?

281
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:57,933
Commander!

282
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:13,907
Move!

283
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:34,845
What did they do?

284
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:38,223
[Haesh rakhi davrae zafraan.]
Lamb men make good slaves.

285
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:41,049
[Khal Drogo vazhoe mora azzafrokea, ]
Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers,

286
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:44,259
[majin azzafroki vazhi kishaan ma hoshor...]
and the slavers will give us gold...

287
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:50,652
[... ma tasokh ma tawakof.]
...and silk, and steel.

288
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:54,698
I thought the Dothraki
didn't believe in money.

289
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:57,868
Gold to hire ships, Princess,

290
00:26:57,993 --> 00:27:00,746
ships to sail to Westeros.

291
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:19,223
Jorah, make them stop.

292
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:21,350
- Khaleesi?
- You heard me.

293
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:25,020
These men have shed blood for their khal.
Now they claim their rewards.

294
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:27,471
[Me vafik, zhey khaleesi.]
She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi.

295
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:29,608
[Dothraki chomoe mae.]
The riders do her honour.

296
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:32,059
[Hash athlaqar mae zireyesee khaleesies,]
if her wailing offends the Khaleesi,

297
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:34,709
[hash anha afichak shafkea lekh moon.]
I will bring you her tongue.

298
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:40,035
Princess, you have a gentle heart,
but this is how it's always been.

299
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,038
I do not have a gentle heart, ser.

300
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:48,036
[Ti mae k'asi, che Khal Drogo anesa valzerikh.]
Do as I command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why.

301
00:27:54,713 --> 00:27:55,513
[Mago!]
Mago!

302
00:27:55,713 --> 00:27:58,413
- [Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.] Only while blood of my blood still lives.
- [Me qorasokh anni!] She is my prize.

303
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,420
Come.

304
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:03,348
[Anha afichak mae m'arakhoon!]
I will take her with an arakh!

305
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:10,232
- What do you want done with them?
- Bring her to me.

306
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:12,734
And those women there.

307
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:16,113
You cannot claim them all, Princess.

308
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,448
I can,

309
00:28:18,574 --> 00:28:20,367
and I will.

310
00:28:21,118 --> 00:28:26,658
[Me Fati! Khaleesi vazha anhaan qorasokh anni]
It's an insult! Khaleesi will give me my prize

311
00:28:26,665 --> 00:28:29,032
[ch'anha afichak mae m'arakhoon anni!]
or I will take it with my arakh!

312
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:34,977
[Me vastoe hatif anni; ahhazaan yer nemo vacchaki.]
She will speak before me; until then you will keep yourself quite.

313
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,261
[Zhey jalan atthirari anni,]
Moon of my life,

314
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:43,467
[Mago asta meshafka fich qorasokh mae,]
Mago says you haven taken his spoils,

315
00:28:43,557 --> 00:28:47,050
[ohara haeshi rakhi fin qoraso me asaja mae.]
a daughter of a lamb man who was his to mount.

316
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,897
[Asti anhaan hash jini jila.]
Tell me the truth of this.

317
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:55,809
[Mago asta k'athjilari, zhey shekh ma shieraki anni.]
Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars.

318
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:58,937
[Anha ray qoraso san ohari asshekh...]
I have claimed many daughters this day...

319
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:01,307
[...majin mori nem vos osaji.]
...so they cannot be mounted.

320
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:06,038
[Jini athvilajerar.]
This is the way of war.

321
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:08,113
[Jin chiorisi zafra ajjin...]
These women are slaves now...

322
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:11,418
[...majin kisha ataki morea ven me vallayafa kisha.]
...to do with as we please.

323
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:14,912
[Anha nem allayafak vassandik mora.]
it pleases me to keep them safe.

324
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:20,002
[Hash dothraki shafki'th saji mora hash mori jif kemoe ma moroa.]
If your riders would mount them, let them take them for wives.

325
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:23,667
[Hash hrazef gova vaf?]
Does the horse mate with the lamb?

326
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:27,661
[Zhavvorsa vadakhera ma hrazef ma vaf akkate.]
The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike.

327
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:29,760
[Yer ifak.]
You are a foreigner.

328
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,855
[Yer assoo anna vosecchi.]
You do not command me.

329
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,859
[Anha Khaleesi. Anha assok yera sekosshi.]
I am Khaleesi. I do command you.

330
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:40,229
[Tihi kifinosi me ivezhofoe?]
See how fierce she grows?

331
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:44,775
[Hazak rizh anni mra me: Vezh fini Asaja Rhaesheseres, ]
That is my son inside her, the stallion that will mount the world,

332
00:29:44,785 --> 00:29:48,163
[fini nirra mae vorsasoon mae.]
filling her with his fire.

333
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:51,291
[Anha acharak vos ale.]
I will hear no more.

334
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:55,202
[Zhey Mago, anha acharak vos ale. Ezas eshna gech ahilee.]
Mago, find somewhere else to stick your cock.

335
00:29:55,212 --> 00:30:00,551
[Khal fines assoe mezhah jahakmeni vos khal.]
A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal.

336
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:03,345
[Ohos!]
Be still.

337
00:30:04,847 --> 00:30:06,557
[Os!]
Don't move!

338
00:30:12,563 --> 00:30:16,525
[Anha vazhok khadoes yeroon virsalat.]
I will not have your body burned.

339
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:20,445
[Anha ochomok yeraan kijinosi.]
I will not give you that honour.

340
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:27,232
[Inte vadakhie tihoa]
The beetles will feed on your eyes.

341
00:30:27,244 --> 00:30:30,372
[ma khewo afilki vi gadimaan.]
The worms will crawl through your lungs.

342
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:40,382
[Eyel varthasoe she ilekaan rikhoya arrekaan...]
The rain will fall on your rotting skin...

343
00:30:41,884 --> 00:30:46,054
[...vekha vosi yeroon vosma tolorro!]
...until nothing is left of you but bones!

344
00:30:49,141 --> 00:30:51,301
[Atte yer eth addrivi anna.]
First you have to kill me.

345
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:52,686
[Jin anha ray et.]
I already have.

346
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:14,322
[Shekh ma shieraki anni zisa.]
My sun and stars is hurt.

347
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,376
[Me zisosh...]
A scratch...

348
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:18,160
[...zhey jalan atthirari anni.]
...moon of my life.

349
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,922
[Finne koalaki?]
Where are the healers?

350
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:23,008
[Jini osto afisi.]
This is the bite of a fly.

351
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:26,893
[Anha laz rhelak dothrakes vezhvena ha zisoshaan mae.]
I can help the great rider with his cut.

352
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:31,715
[Qotho speaks Dothraki] ]Khal zigeree vo rhellay ha zafroon fini govi oqet.]
The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep.

353
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:34,186
[Me anni. Me vastoe.]
She is mine. Let her speak.

354
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:36,313
Thank you, silver lady.

355
00:31:38,649 --> 00:31:41,109
Who are you?

356
00:31:41,193 --> 00:31:44,321
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the godswife of this temple.

357
00:31:44,446 --> 00:31:45,771
[Maegi.]
Witch.

358
00:31:45,781 --> 00:31:48,075
My mother was
godswife here before me.

359
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:50,994
She taught me how
to make healing smokes and ointments.

360
00:31:51,078 --> 00:31:53,956
All men are of one flock,
so my people believe.

361
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:56,083
The great shepherd sent me
to earth to heal his...

362
00:31:57,543 --> 00:32:01,743
[Ase sekke. Ase maegi izzi char.]
Too many words. A witch's words poison the ears.

363
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:03,966
Lamb or lion,

364
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:08,136
his wound must be washed
and sewn or it will fester.

365
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:13,090
[Azhas maan affisat zis yeri, shekh ma shieraki anni...]
Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars...

366
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,260
[...me azzisa anna jin tihat meyer qiyae.]
...it makes me hurt to see you bleed.

367
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:42,546
For 30 years I've been making
corpses out of men, boy.

368
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:45,215
I'm the man you want
leading the vanguard.

369
00:32:46,717 --> 00:32:48,844
Galbart Glover will lead the van.

370
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:51,555
The bloody wall will melt

371
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,892
before an Umber
marches behind a Glover.

372
00:32:55,601 --> 00:32:59,813
I will lead the van
or I will take my men

373
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:02,107
and march them home.

374
00:33:07,196 --> 00:33:09,740
You are welcome
to do so, Lord Umber.

375
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:12,826
And when I am done
with the Lannisters,

376
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:16,747
I will march back north,
root you out of your keep

377
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:19,499
and hang you for an oathbreaker.

378
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:21,960
Oathbreaker, is it?!

379
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:28,592
I'll not sit here and swallow insults
from a boy so green he pisses grass.

380
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:44,775
My lord father taught me
it was death to bare steel

381
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:46,860
against your liege lord.

382
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:50,989
But doubtless the Greatjon
only meant to cut my meat for me.

383
00:33:53,158 --> 00:33:55,536
Your meat...

384
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:03,377
is bloody tough.

385
00:34:34,116 --> 00:34:37,578
- What is it? What's happened?
- Shh, it's all right.

386
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:45,043
- Where are you going?
- South. For Father.

387
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:49,047
- But it's the middle of the night.
- The Lannisters have spies everywhere.

388
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:51,675
I don't want them to know
we're coming.

389
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:56,555
- They have more men than we do.
- Aye, they do.

390
00:34:57,598 --> 00:34:59,725
Can't I come with you?
I can ride now.

391
00:34:59,808 --> 00:35:02,978
You've seen me riding.
And I won't get in the way, I...

392
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:05,647
There must always be
a Stark at Winterfell.

393
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:08,984
Until I return that will be you.

394
00:35:10,944 --> 00:35:14,781
You are not to leave the castle walls
while we are gone. Do you understand?

395
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:19,828
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.

396
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:24,041
- I will.
- I'll send letters whenever I can,

397
00:35:24,082 --> 00:35:28,128
but if you don't hear from me,
don't be scared.

398
00:35:33,425 --> 00:35:35,469
Until I return.

399
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:59,117
How long have you been
hiding out there?

400
00:35:59,284 --> 00:36:02,329
Robb will be looking for you
to say goodbye.

401
00:36:03,747 --> 00:36:07,334
- They've all gone away.
- They'll be back soon.

402
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:10,796
Robb will free Father
and they'll come back with Mother.

403
00:36:12,673 --> 00:36:14,967
No, they won't.

404
00:36:20,138 --> 00:36:21,932
Please watch over Robb.

405
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:25,143
And watch over
all the other men from Winterfell.

406
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:27,396
And Theon too, I suppose.

407
00:36:33,402 --> 00:36:35,445
You hear them, boy?

408
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:39,074
The old gods are answering you.

409
00:36:39,157 --> 00:36:43,537
- What are you doing here?
- They're my gods too.

410
00:36:46,123 --> 00:36:49,042
Beyond the Wall,
they're the only gods.

411
00:36:49,835 --> 00:36:53,547
- Even slaves are allowed to pray.
- You're not a slave.

412
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:59,845
Well, your friend
did put a knife to my throat.

413
00:37:00,846 --> 00:37:03,265
I'm not complaining, little lord,

414
00:37:04,474 --> 00:37:06,476
just telling truths.

415
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:11,023
What did you mean
about hearing the gods?

416
00:37:11,148 --> 00:37:14,401
You asked them,
they're answering you.

417
00:37:15,527 --> 00:37:17,863
Shh.

418
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:21,366
Open your ears.

419
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:26,788
It's only the wind.

420
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:30,584
Who do you think
sends the wind if not the gods?

421
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,504
They see you, boy.

422
00:37:34,296 --> 00:37:37,090
They hear you.

423
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:40,469
Your brother will get
no help from them where he's going.

424
00:37:40,594 --> 00:37:43,180
The old gods have
no power in the South.

425
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:47,017
The weirwoods there were all
cut down a long time ago.

426
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:49,645
How can they watch
when they have no eyes?

427
00:37:52,147 --> 00:37:56,610
Well, there's a big man.

428
00:37:56,735 --> 00:37:59,863
He has giants' blood
in him or I'm the queen.

429
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:03,075
Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.

430
00:38:03,158 --> 00:38:05,577
- Go dress.
- Hodor.

431
00:38:08,747 --> 00:38:10,874
Are there really giants beyond the wall?

432
00:38:12,543 --> 00:38:15,420
Giants and worse than giants.

433
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:20,217
I tried telling your brother,
he's marching the wrong way.

434
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,679
All these swords,
they should be going north, boy.

435
00:38:23,804 --> 00:38:25,806
North, not south!

436
00:38:28,851 --> 00:38:32,521
The cold winds are rising.

437
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:50,873
They were touched by white walkers.

438
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:53,208
That's why they came back.

439
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:55,669
That's why their eyes turned blue.

440
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,839
Only fire will stop them.

441
00:39:00,883 --> 00:39:04,428
- How do you know that?
- I read about it in a book...

442
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:07,514
a very old book
in Maester Aemon's library.

443
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:14,062
- What else did the book say?
- The white walkers

444
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:17,524
sleep beneath the ice
for thousands of years.

445
00:39:17,566 --> 00:39:19,484
And when they wake up...

446
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:24,281
And when they wake up, what?

447
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:29,703
I hope the Wall's high enough.

448
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:04,905
Summer snows, my lady.

449
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:07,658
Robb's brought the North with him.

450
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:17,626
The river lords are falling back
with Jaime Lannister at their heels.

451
00:40:17,709 --> 00:40:21,171
And Lord Tywin is bringing around
a second Lannister army from the South.

452
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:23,841
Our scouts confirm
it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.

453
00:40:23,924 --> 00:40:27,094
One army or two,
the kings in the North

454
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:30,931
threw back hosts 10 times as large.

455
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:36,103
Mother!

456
00:40:40,983 --> 00:40:43,151
You look well.

457
00:40:43,235 --> 00:40:47,281
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight
in these troubled times.

458
00:40:47,406 --> 00:40:50,325
We had thought not
to meet you here, my lady.

459
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,744
I had not thought to be here.

460
00:40:53,245 --> 00:40:55,205
I would speak with my son alone.

461
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,583
I know you will forgive me, my lords.

462
00:40:57,666 --> 00:40:59,877
You heard her!
Move your arses!

463
00:40:59,918 --> 00:41:02,254
Come on, out.

464
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:05,299
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?

465
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:07,009
Have no fear, my lady.

466
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:09,720
We'll shove our swords
up Tywin Lannister's bunghole

467
00:41:09,803 --> 00:41:12,556
and then it's on
to the Red Keep to free Ned.

468
00:41:13,182 --> 00:41:15,350
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.

469
00:41:15,475 --> 00:41:17,686
You're not wasting away, are you?

470
00:41:29,281 --> 00:41:32,201
I remember the day
you came into this world,

471
00:41:32,284 --> 00:41:34,828
red-faced and squalling.

472
00:41:36,371 --> 00:41:39,041
And now I find you leading a host to war.

473
00:41:40,209 --> 00:41:42,961
- There was no one else.
- No one?

474
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:45,130
Who were those men I saw here?

475
00:41:45,214 --> 00:41:49,301
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.

476
00:41:49,384 --> 00:41:51,553
If you think you can
send me back to Winterfell...

477
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,014
Oh, would that I could.

478
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:59,311
There was...

479
00:41:59,394 --> 00:42:01,438
a letter.

480
00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:06,068
From Sansa.

481
00:42:06,151 --> 00:42:08,362
From the queen, you mean.

482
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:19,540
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.

483
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:32,970
How many men do you have?

484
00:42:33,053 --> 00:42:35,013
18,000.

485
00:42:35,097 --> 00:42:37,391
If I go to King's Landing
and bend my knee to Joffrey...

486
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:40,435
You would never
be allowed to leave. No.

487
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:44,231
Our best hope,
our only hope,

488
00:42:44,398 --> 00:42:48,735
- is that you can defeat them in the field.
- And if I lose?

489
00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:51,321
Do you know what happened
to the Targaryen children

490
00:42:51,405 --> 00:42:54,616
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.

491
00:42:54,825 --> 00:42:57,119
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.

492
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,746
And the years have not made him kinder.

493
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:05,252
If you lose,

494
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:09,339
your father dies, your sisters die,

495
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:11,508
we die.

496
00:43:14,595 --> 00:43:17,014
Well, that makes it simple, then.

497
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:19,474
I suppose it does.

498
00:43:42,706 --> 00:43:46,210
From here it might be best
if Bronn and I continue alone.

499
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:48,629
Best for Tyrion, son of Tywin.

500
00:43:48,712 --> 00:43:50,506
Not best for me.

501
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:53,675
If the halfman betrays us,

502
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,554
Shagga, son of Dolf,
will cut off his manhood...

503
00:43:57,638 --> 00:44:00,432
And feed it to the goats, yes.

504
00:44:02,267 --> 00:44:04,811
All right, then.

505
00:44:04,937 --> 00:44:06,980
Time to meet my father.

506
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,015
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.

507
00:44:42,182 --> 00:44:44,017
Father.

508
00:44:45,644 --> 00:44:48,605
The rumours of your demise
were unfounded.

509
00:44:49,731 --> 00:44:52,067
Sorry to disappoint you.

510
00:44:52,818 --> 00:44:54,444
And who are these...

511
00:44:54,528 --> 00:44:56,655
companions of yours?

512
00:44:58,657 --> 00:45:01,743
This is Shagga, son of Dolf,

513
00:45:01,827 --> 00:45:03,871
chieftain of the Stone Crows.

514
00:45:04,329 --> 00:45:08,375
Timett, son of Timett
ruler of the Burned Men.

515
00:45:08,834 --> 00:45:13,297
This fair maid is Chella,
daughter of Cheyk,

516
00:45:13,422 --> 00:45:15,340
leader of the Black Ears.

517
00:45:15,424 --> 00:45:17,843
And here we have Bronn, son of...

518
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,055
You wouldn't know him.

519
00:45:23,557 --> 00:45:26,018
May I present my lord father,

520
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,770
Tywin, son of Tytos of House Lannister,

521
00:45:28,854 --> 00:45:32,107
Lord of Casterly Rock
and Warden of the West?

522
00:45:33,817 --> 00:45:36,278
Kind of you to go to war for me.

523
00:45:39,198 --> 00:45:41,158
You left us no choice.

524
00:45:41,283 --> 00:45:43,577
The honour of the house was at stake.

525
00:45:44,536 --> 00:45:48,040
Your brother would never have
submitted to capture so meekly.

526
00:45:48,165 --> 00:45:50,584
We have our differences, Jaime and I.

527
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:52,794
He's braver. I'm better-looking.

528
00:45:52,878 --> 00:45:55,464
He's been covering himself in glory.

529
00:45:55,506 --> 00:45:58,300
Jaime smashed the river lords
at the Golden Tooth,

530
00:45:58,425 --> 00:46:02,304
and now lays siege to Riverrun,
Catelyn Stark's homeland.

531
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:05,349
- And the Starks? Lord Eddard?
- Is our hostage.

532
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:08,435
He will lead no armies
from his dungeon cell.

533
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:12,439
How did my sweet sister persuade the king
to imprison his dear friend Ned?

534
00:46:12,564 --> 00:46:17,319
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.

535
00:46:19,738 --> 00:46:22,032
My sister rules, you mean.

536
00:46:22,115 --> 00:46:24,284
Stark's son has called his banners.

537
00:46:24,743 --> 00:46:28,705
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.

538
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:32,626
One taste of battle and he'll run back
to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.

539
00:46:33,919 --> 00:46:38,423
Maybe. Though the boy does have
a certain belligerence.

540
00:46:38,549 --> 00:46:40,175
You'd like him.

541
00:46:41,218 --> 00:46:45,222
While we're on the subject of war,

542
00:46:45,389 --> 00:46:47,391
I made promises to my friends here,

543
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:49,852
and a Lannister always pays his debts.

544
00:46:49,977 --> 00:46:52,855
We shall require
3,000 helms and shields,

545
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,065
plus swords, pikes,

546
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:57,025
gorgets, maces...

547
00:46:57,943 --> 00:47:00,404
if it please my lord,
Ser Addam bids me report

548
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:02,990
that the northmen
have crossed the Neck.

549
00:47:05,117 --> 00:47:08,745
The wolf rushes
into the lion's jaws. So be it.

550
00:47:08,871 --> 00:47:12,040
Kevan, command
the drummers beat assembly.

551
00:47:13,542 --> 00:47:16,503
And send word to Jaime
that I am moving against Robb Stark.

552
00:47:16,628 --> 00:47:18,505
At once, my lord.

553
00:47:31,185 --> 00:47:34,313
It is said that the men
of the mountain clans are great warriors.

554
00:47:34,438 --> 00:47:36,190
Ride with me against my enemies

555
00:47:36,315 --> 00:47:39,109
and you shall have
all my son promised you and more.

556
00:47:39,193 --> 00:47:41,570
Only if the halfman fights with us.

557
00:47:41,695 --> 00:47:44,323
Until we hold the steel he pledged us,

558
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:47,868
the little lion's life is ours.

559
00:47:53,165 --> 00:47:56,168
The scouts report
Lord Tywin moves north.

560
00:47:56,293 --> 00:47:59,213
We need to get him on broken ground,
put his knights at a disadvantage.

561
00:47:59,338 --> 00:48:04,301
No, we need to get around him and break
Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.

562
00:48:04,426 --> 00:48:07,221
Do that and the river lords will join us.

563
00:48:07,304 --> 00:48:10,933
To do either we need to cross the river
and the only crossing is at the Twins.

564
00:48:11,016 --> 00:48:14,436
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerman.

565
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:17,814
"The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.

566
00:48:17,856 --> 00:48:21,693
At the Trident, he didn't appear
until the battle was done.

567
00:48:21,818 --> 00:48:25,739
Some men take their oaths
more seriously than others.

568
00:48:32,829 --> 00:48:35,457
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.

569
00:48:35,582 --> 00:48:37,668
So what's it going to be?

570
00:48:37,793 --> 00:48:41,505
Do we move against
Jaime or Lord Tywin?

571
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:49,388
Your pardon, my lords.
We've captured a Lannister scout.

572
00:48:51,348 --> 00:48:54,601
Don't worry, lad. He won't be
leaving this tent with his head.

573
00:48:56,103 --> 00:48:59,898
- Where did you find him?
- In the brush above the encampment.

574
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:02,150
He looked to be counting.

575
00:49:12,286 --> 00:49:13,954
How high did you get?

576
00:49:16,415 --> 00:49:19,168
20,000. Maybe more.

577
00:49:19,251 --> 00:49:22,754
You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand...

578
00:49:22,838 --> 00:49:26,842
My father understands mercy,
when there is room for it.

579
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:31,471
And he understands honour...

580
00:49:32,848 --> 00:49:35,100
and courage.

581
00:49:37,144 --> 00:49:39,354
Let him go.

582
00:49:39,938 --> 00:49:42,149
Robb.

583
00:49:54,286 --> 00:49:57,664
Tell Lord Tywin
winter is coming for him.

584
00:49:57,789 --> 00:50:02,169
20,000 northerners marching south
to find out if he really does shit gold.

585
00:50:04,254 --> 00:50:06,548
Yes, my lord.

586
00:50:06,632 --> 00:50:08,675
Thank you, my lord.

587
00:50:17,184 --> 00:50:20,938
Are you touched, boy?!
Letting him go?

588
00:50:21,063 --> 00:50:22,689
You call me boy again.

589
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:25,901
Go on.

590
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,462
Oi.

591
00:50:51,385 --> 00:50:54,263
It is also the wish of His Grace

592
00:50:54,388 --> 00:50:58,308
that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,

593
00:50:59,476 --> 00:51:02,229
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.

594
00:51:02,312 --> 00:51:06,942
...be at once raised to the rank of lord...

595
00:51:07,109 --> 00:51:08,360
Lord Gyles.

596
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:11,780
...and granted
the ancient seat of Harrenhal,

597
00:51:11,864 --> 00:51:15,450
and that his sons and grandsons
shall hold this honour

598
00:51:15,534 --> 00:51:20,455
after him until the end of time.

599
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:28,005
In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark,

600
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:32,426
it is the wish of His Grace
that Tywin Lannister,

601
00:51:32,551 --> 00:51:36,972
Lord of Casterly Rock
and Warden of the West,

602
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:40,350
be appointed Hand of the King.

603
00:51:40,434 --> 00:51:42,352
Lastly,

604
00:51:42,477 --> 00:51:45,272
in these times of treason and turmoil,

605
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:48,400
it is the view of council

606
00:51:48,483 --> 00:51:51,570
that the life and safety

607
00:51:51,653 --> 00:51:53,614
of King Joffrey

608
00:51:53,697 --> 00:51:57,868
be of paramount importance.

609
00:51:59,453 --> 00:52:02,039
Ser Barristan Selmy.

610
00:52:08,545 --> 00:52:11,924
Your Grace,
I am yours to command.

611
00:52:12,049 --> 00:52:14,009
Rise, Ser Barristan.

612
00:52:14,885 --> 00:52:16,970
You may remove your helm.

613
00:52:22,142 --> 00:52:24,645
You have served the realm
long and faithfully.

614
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:28,524
Every man and woman
in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.

615
00:52:28,607 --> 00:52:31,944
But it is time to put aside
your armour and your sword.

616
00:52:32,069 --> 00:52:34,821
It is time to rest
and look back with pride

617
00:52:34,905 --> 00:52:37,824
on your many years of service.

618
00:52:38,742 --> 00:52:41,245
Your Grace, the Kingsguard
is a sworn brotherhood.

619
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:45,874
Our vows are taken for life.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.

620
00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:49,795
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your king's?

621
00:52:50,629 --> 00:52:52,548
You let my father die.

622
00:52:52,631 --> 00:52:55,509
You're too old to protect anybody.

623
00:52:58,345 --> 00:53:00,514
- Your Grace...
- The council has determined

624
00:53:00,597 --> 00:53:03,058
that Ser Jaime Lannister
will take your place

625
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:06,895
- as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
- The man who profaned his blade

626
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,064
with the blood of the king
he had sworn to defend!

627
00:53:09,147 --> 00:53:11,066
Careful, ser.

628
00:53:11,191 --> 00:53:15,279
We have nothing but gratitude
for your long service, good ser.

629
00:53:15,404 --> 00:53:17,906
You shall be given
a stout keep beside the sea,

630
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:20,742
with servants
to look after your every need.

631
00:53:20,868 --> 00:53:24,830
A hall to die in
and men to bury me.

632
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:29,459
I am a knight.

633
00:53:29,543 --> 00:53:32,588
I shall die a knight.

634
00:53:38,594 --> 00:53:40,637
A naked knight, apparently.

635
00:53:51,857 --> 00:53:55,694
Even now I could cut through
the five of you like carving a cake!

636
00:53:59,698 --> 00:54:01,950
Here, boy!

637
00:54:02,075 --> 00:54:04,703
Melt it down and add it to the others.

638
00:54:21,011 --> 00:54:23,263
If any man in this hall
has other matters

639
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:27,059
to set before His Grace,
let him speak now

640
00:54:27,184 --> 00:54:29,686
or go forth and hold his silence.

641
00:54:32,898 --> 00:54:34,650
Your Grace.

642
00:54:35,776 --> 00:54:37,819
Come forward, my lady.

643
00:54:38,779 --> 00:54:41,698
The Lady Sansa
of House Stark.

644
00:54:42,783 --> 00:54:46,370
Do you have some business
for the king and the council, Sansa?

645
00:54:46,954 --> 00:54:48,413
I do.

646
00:54:53,085 --> 00:54:56,755
As it please Your Grace,
I ask mercy for my father,

647
00:54:56,839 --> 00:54:59,424
Lord Eddard Stark,
who was Hand of the King.

648
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:02,719
Treason is a noxious weed.

649
00:55:03,303 --> 00:55:06,849
- It should be torn out, root...
- Let her speak.

650
00:55:06,932 --> 00:55:09,685
I want to hear what she says.

651
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:11,728
Thank you, Your Grace.

652
00:55:11,812 --> 00:55:14,356
Do you deny your father's crime?

653
00:55:14,439 --> 00:55:18,235
No, my lords.
I know he must be punished.

654
00:55:19,236 --> 00:55:20,988
All I ask is mercy.

655
00:55:21,488 --> 00:55:23,782
I know my lord father
must regret what he did.

656
00:55:23,907 --> 00:55:25,909
He was King Robert's friend
and he loved him.

657
00:55:25,993 --> 00:55:27,703
You all know he loved him.

658
00:55:28,453 --> 00:55:32,499
He never wanted to be Hand
until the king asked him.

659
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:36,378
They must have lied to him -
Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.

660
00:55:36,503 --> 00:55:38,338
They must have lied!

661
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:40,883
He said I wasn't the king.

662
00:55:41,758 --> 00:55:45,179
- Why did he say that?
- He was badly hurt.

663
00:55:45,304 --> 00:55:48,265
Maester Pycelle
was giving him milk of the poppy.

664
00:55:48,348 --> 00:55:52,186
He wasn't himself.
Otherwise he never would have said it.

665
00:55:54,188 --> 00:55:56,231
A child's faith.

666
00:55:56,356 --> 00:55:58,650
Such sweet innocence.

667
00:55:59,276 --> 00:56:03,530
And yet they say wisdom
oft comes from the mouths of babes.

668
00:56:03,989 --> 00:56:08,160
Treason is treason!

669
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:13,498
Anything else?

670
00:56:15,042 --> 00:56:18,837
If you still have any affection
in your heart for me,

671
00:56:18,921 --> 00:56:22,021
please do me this kindness, Your Grace.

672
00:56:31,725 --> 00:56:33,852
Your sweet words have moved me.

673
00:56:35,979 --> 00:56:38,899
But your father has to confess.

674
00:56:39,024 --> 00:56:42,444
He has to confess
and say that I'm the king...

675
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:47,449
or there'll be no mercy for him.

676
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,122
He will.

677
00:56:55,079 --> 00:57:00,122
BURN ALL THE WITCHES AND THAT ASSHOLE; JOFFREY!!!

3
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,297
You've seen better days, my lord.

4
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,592
Another visit?

5
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,346
It seems you're my last friend.

6
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,307
No, no, many still love you.

7
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:25,687
Sansa came to court this morning
to plead for your life.

8
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,566
On her knees begging for me. Hm!

9
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,818
Did you laugh with the others?

10
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:35,531
You do me wrong, my lord.
Your blood is the last thing I want.

11
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,533
I don't know what you want.

12
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,284
I've given up trying to guess.

13
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,915
When I was still a boy -

14
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,794
before they cut my balls off with a hot knife -

15
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,381
I travelled with a group of actors
through the free cities.

16
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:57,010
They taught me that
each man has a role to play.

17
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,888
The same is true at court.

18
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:02,266
I am the master of whisperers.

19
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:06,770
My role is to be sly, obsequious
and without scruples.

20
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,856
I'm a good actor, my lord.

21
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:12,234
Huh. Can you free me from this pit?

22
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,361
I could.

23
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:15,821
But will I?

24
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,282
No.

25
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,367
As I said, I'm no hero.

26
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,244
What do you want? Tell me.

27
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,205
No riddles, no stories...
Tell me, what do you want?

28
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,917
Peace.

29
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:35,090
Did you know that your son is marching south
with an army of northmen? Loyal lad.

30
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,551
Fighting for his father's freedom.

31
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,845
Robb?

32
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,763
He's just a boy.

33
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,099
Boys have been conquerors before.

34
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:50,772
But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights
is the king's... the late king's brother.

35
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,650
Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne.

36
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,945
He is a proven battle commander
and he is utterly without mercy.

37
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,450
Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir.
The throne is his by rights.

38
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:08,290
Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life.
It would be a shame to throw it away.

39
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,919
Cersei is no fool.

40
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:15,339
She knows a tame wolf
is more use to her than a dead one.

41
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:19,009
You want me to serve the woman who
murdered my king, who butchered my men,

42
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,719
who crippled my son?

43
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,763
I want you to serve the realm!

44
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,599
Tell the queen you will confess
your vile treason,

45
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,726
tell your son to lay down his sword

46
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:31,021
and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir.

47
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:36,109
Cersei knows you as a man of honour.

48
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:40,989
If you give her the peace she needs,
and promise to carry her secret to your grave,

49
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,700
I believe she will allow you
to take the black

50
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:47,329
and live out your days on the Wall
with your brother and your bastard son.

51
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,375
You think my life
is some precious thing to me?

52
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,213
That I would trade my honour
for a few more years of...

53
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,965
Of what?

54
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,930
You grew up with actors.

55
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,393
You learned their craft and you learnt it well.

56
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,855
But I grew up with soldiers.

57
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,317
I learned how to die a long time ago.

58
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:22,114
Pity.

59
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:25,075
Such a pity.

60
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:34,334
What of your daughter's life, my lord?

61
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,879
Is that a precious thing to you?

62
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,215
It's a birthday message
to his grand-niece Walda.

63
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,093
- Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
- Keep shooting them down.

64
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:28,222
We can't risk Lord Walder sending
word of your movements to the Lannisters.

65
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,350
He's Grandfather's bannerman.
We can't expect his support?

66
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:35,229
Expect nothing of Walder Frey
and you'll never be surprised.

67
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:36,522
Look.

68
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,484
Father rots in a dungeon.

69
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,694
How long before they take his head?

70
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,822
We need to cross the Trident
and we need to do it now.

71
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,408
Just march up to his gates
and tell him you're crossing.

72
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:51,453
We've got five times his numbers.
You can take the Twins if you have to.

73
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:54,957
Not in time.
Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.

74
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,751
The Freys have
held the crossing for 600 years,

75
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:01,004
and for 600 years
they have never failed to exact their toll.

76
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,340
Have my horse saddled and ready.

77
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:06,593
Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you
to the Lannisters as he likes.

78
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,513
Or throw you in a dungeon.
Or slit your throat.

79
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:15,269
My father would do whatever it took
to secure our crossing.

80
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,646
Whatever it took.

81
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:22,317
If I'm going to lead this army, I can't have
other men doing my bargaining for me.

82
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,610
I agree.

83
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:26,822
- I'll go.
- You can't!

84
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:31,243
I have known Lord Walder since I was a girl.
He would never harm me.

85
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,787
Unless there was a profit in it.

86
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,336
What do you want?

87
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:45,048
It is a great pleasure to see you again
after so many years, my lord.

88
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:46,884
Oh, spare me.

89
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:51,096
Your boy's too proud
to come before me himself.

90
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,223
What am I supposed to do with you?

91
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:56,351
Father, you forget yourself.
Lady Stark is here...

92
00:07:56,435 --> 00:08:02,524
Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet,
not until I die. Do I look dead to you?

93
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:06,403
- Father, please...
- I need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard?

94
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:11,950
Your mother would still be a milkmaid
if I hadn't squirted you into her belly.

95
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,498
All right, you come forward.

96
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,679
There.
Now that I've observed the courtesies,

97
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:36,183
perhaps my sons will do me the honour
of shutting their mouths.

98
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:43,524
Is there somewhere we can talk?

99
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,692
We're talking right now.

100
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,240
Fine.

101
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,909
Out! All of you!

102
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,629
- Oh!
- You too.

103
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,180
You see that?

104
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:17,349
Fifteen, she is.

105
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,268
A little flower.

106
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,814
And her honey's all mine.

107
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,569
I'm sure she will give you many sons.

108
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,322
Huh.
Your father didn't come to the wedding.

109
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,366
He is quite ill, my lord.

110
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,536
Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either.

111
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,913
Or the one before that.

112
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,542
Your family has always pissed on me.

113
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,545
- My lord, I...
- Don't deny it. You know it's true.

114
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:51,091
The fine Lord Tully would never marry
any of his children to mine.

115
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:54,094
- I'm sure there were reasons...
- I didn't need reasons.

116
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:58,932
I needed to get rid of sons and daughters.
You see how they pile up?

117
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,479
Why are you here?

118
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,150
To ask you...

119
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,527
to open your gates, my lord...

120
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:15,157
so my son and his bannermen
may cross the Trident and be on their way.

121
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:18,327
- Why should I let him?
- If you could climb your own battlements,

122
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:21,955
you would see that he has
20,000 men outside your walls.

123
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,459
They'll be 20,000 corpses
when Tywin Lannister gets here.

124
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,878
Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark.

125
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,422
Your husband's in a cell
beneath the Red Keep

126
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,383
and your son's got no fur
to keep his balls warm.

127
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,802
You swore an oath to my father.

128
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:39,014
Oh, yes, I said some words.

129
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,309
And I swore oaths to the crown too,
if I remember right.

130
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:44,686
Joffrey's king now,

131
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:49,441
which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be
nothing but rebels, it seems to me.

132
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:55,364
If I had the sense the gods gave a fish,
I'd hand you both over to the Lannisters.

133
00:10:55,447 --> 00:11:00,369
- Why don't you?
- Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon.

134
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:06,250
Give me one good reason why I should
waste a single thought on any of you?

135
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:09,044
And... engage!

136
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:14,383
When does Aemon think
you'll be able to use that hand?

137
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,677
- Soon, he says.
- Good.

138
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,514
You'll be ready for this, then.

139
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,352
I thought a wolf was more
appropriate for you than a bear...

140
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,898
so I had a new pommel made.
It's called Longclaw.

141
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,694
Works as well for a wolf as a bear, I think.

142
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:46,373
This is Valyrian steel.

143
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:52,045
It was my father's sword,
his father before him.

144
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:55,591
The Mormonts have carried it
for five centuries.

145
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,718
It was meant for my son Jorah.

146
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:03,557
He brought dishonour to our House,
but he had the grace to leave the sword

147
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,893
before he fled from Westeros.

148
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:10,063
- My lord, you honour me, but I can't...
- Oh, you can.

149
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,899
And you will.

150
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:15,903
I wouldn't be standing here
if it wasn't for you and your beast.

151
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,739
A bloody dead man tried to kill me.

152
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,453
So you'll take it.
I'll hear no more about it.

153
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:27,289
- Is that understood?
- Yes, my lord.

154
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,957
Right.

155
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:34,963
Now, don't think this means I approve
of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne.

156
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:38,592
That's a man's sword.
It'll take a man to wield it.

157
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,929
I'll apologise to Ser Alliser tonight.

158
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:45,474
No, you won't.
I sent him to King's Landing yesterday.

159
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:49,603
The hand that your wolf tore off
that thing's wrist...

160
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:52,981
I've, uh, ordered Thorne
to lay it at the feet of this...

161
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,983
boy king.

162
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:57,945
That should get young Joffrey's attention.

163
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:04,117
And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues
between you and Thorne.

164
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:06,828
Now go and put your sword somewhere safe...

165
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:09,289
and bring me my supper.

166
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,999
Yes, my lord.

167
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,888
- Well done.
- Well done.

168
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,642
You earned that, Snow.

169
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,648
Well done.

170
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:40,571
Go on, let's have a look.

171
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:42,990
- At what?
- The sword! Show us the sword.

172
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:46,034
Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!

173
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:49,371
Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!

174
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,295
- Let's have a look.
- Piss off.

175
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:02,301
Come on,
I want to have a look at it in the light.

176
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,181
Give it here!

177
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:09,183
What is it?

178
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:11,310
- I...
- Look at its eyes.

179
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:12,978
- Give it.
- I can't.

180
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,564
You can't what?

181
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:16,857
I...

182
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:21,153
I'm really not supposed to say.

183
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:23,906
And yet you really want to say.

184
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,991
You want to say that...?

185
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:32,080
There was a raven.

186
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:34,082
I read the message to Maester Aemon.

187
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:38,337
It's your brother Robb.

188
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:40,214
What?

189
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:41,882
What about him?

190
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:44,843
He's heading south.

191
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,762
To war.

192
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:52,809
All his bannermen have rallied to his side.
They'll keep him safe.

193
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:56,230
I should be there.

194
00:14:58,232 --> 00:14:59,900
I should be with him.

195
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,042
If we do that, they'll never get back across.

196
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,587
Well?

197
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,381
What did he say?

198
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:26,051
Lord Walder has granted your crossing.

199
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:31,098
- His men are yours, as well.
- Huh.

200
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:34,977
Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the
crossing against any who would pursue you.

201
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,436
What does he want in return?

202
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:40,816
You will be taking on his son Olyvar
as your personal squire.

203
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,777
- He expects a knighthood in good time.
- Fine, fine.

204
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,406
And?

205
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,576
And Arya...

206
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:54,496
will marry his son Waldron
when they both come of age.

207
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,291
- She won't be happy about that.
- Hm.

208
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:02,504
And?

209
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,673
And...

210
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:07,968
when the fighting is done...

211
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:12,431
you will marry one of his daughters.

212
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,517
Whichever you prefer.

213
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:19,021
He has a number
he thinks will be... suitable.

214
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:21,023
I see.

215
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:25,194
Did you get a look at his daughters?

216
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:26,695
I did.

217
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,156
And?

218
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:32,075
One was...

219
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,750
Do you consent?

220
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:43,462
- Can I refuse?
- Not if you want to cross.

221
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:48,634
Then I consent.

222
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:36,640
Sam said you wanted to see me?

223
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:39,142
I did indeed.

224
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:42,229
Perhaps you would
be kind enough to assist me.

225
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:50,904
Tell me, did you ever wonder
why the men of the Night's Watch

226
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:54,074
take no wives and father no children?

227
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:55,868
No.

228
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:57,703
So they will not love.

229
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:02,249
Love is the death of duty.

230
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:06,170
If the day should ever come when
your lord father was forced to choose...

231
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,589
between honour on the one hand...

232
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:11,175
I
and those he loves on the other

233
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:12,551
what would he do?

234
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:17,764
He... He would do whatever was right.
No matter what.

235
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,019
Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000.

236
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,730
Most of us are not so strong.

237
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,441
What is honour...

238
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:30,277
compared to a woman's love?

239
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:32,779
And what is duty...

240
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:36,450
against the feel
of a newborn son in your arms?

241
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,911
Or a brother's smile?

242
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:44,791
Sam told you.

243
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,919
We're all human.

244
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:50,255
Oh, we all do our duty
when there's no cost to it.

245
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:53,133
Honour comes easy then.

246
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,718
Yet...

247
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,762
sooner or later...

248
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:58,805
in every man's life...

249
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:01,934
there comes a day when it is not easy.

250
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:05,103
A day when he must choose.

251
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:08,982
And this is my day?

252
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:11,151
Is that what you're saying?

253
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:14,363
Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes.

254
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,366
- I know.
- You do not know.

255
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:21,245
No one knows.

256
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,998
I may be a bastard,

257
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:27,626
but he is my father and Robb is my brother.

258
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:36,176
The gods were cruel
when they saw fit to test my vows.

259
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,303
They waited till I was old.

260
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:43,809
What could I do when the ravens
brought the news from the South...

261
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:46,353
the ruin of my House,
the death of my family?

262
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,355
I was helpless...

263
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:51,775
blind, frail.

264
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:55,529
But...

265
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:59,116
when I heard they had
killed my brother's son...

266
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,285
and his poor son...

267
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:02,828
and the children!

268
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:05,247
Even the little children.

269
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:09,001
Who are you?

270
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:14,923
My father was Maekar,

271
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:17,134
the first of his name.

272
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:21,513
My brother Aegon reigned after him...

273
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:24,474
when I had refused the throne.

274
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:28,020
And he was followed by his son Aerys...

275
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:31,064
whom they called the Mad King.

276
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:32,816
You're Aemon Targaryen.

277
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:37,613
I'm a maester of the Citadel,

278
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:41,909
bound in service to Castle Black
and the Night's Watch.

279
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:48,957
I will not tell you... to stay or go.

280
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:52,628
You must make that choice yourself...

281
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:55,964
and live with it for the rest of your days.

282
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:00,969
As I have.

283
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:22,449
[Khal anni...]
My lord...

284
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:25,077
[Shekh ma shieraki anni...]
My sun and stars...

285
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:29,248
Drogo.

286
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:38,966
[Sajo anni.]
My Horse.

287
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:42,302
[Sajo... anni.]
My... Horse.

288
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:44,221
[Qoy qoyi...]
Blood of my blood...

289
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:48,267
[Vos, anha'th dothrak]
No, I must ride.

290
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:51,270
[Me arthas hrazefoon mae.]
He fell from his horse.

291
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,440
[Khal fini laz vos dothrao, vos khal.]
A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.

292
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:58,807
[Me haqa, vos ale. Me zigeree mithrat.]
He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest.

293
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:03,146
[Kisha ray hezhahish chek asshekh. Kisha avimithreraki jinne.]
We've ridden far enough today. We will camp here.

294
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:05,367
[Jinne vos gache vimithrerat.]
This is no place to camp.

295
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:08,819
[Chiori vos assoo kisha. Vos Khaleesi akka.]
A woman does not give us orders. Not even a Khaleesi.

296
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:12,865
[Kisha avimithreraki jinne. Asti morea me Khal Drogo asso moon.]
We'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.

297
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:15,636
[Shafka vos assoo anna zhey Khaleesi.]
You do not command me Khaleesi.

298
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:18,829
[Ezi Mirri Maaz Duur. Fichi mae anhaan.]
Find Mirri Maz Duur. Bring her to me.

299
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:21,456
[Maegi? Anha afichak shafkea nharees zhey Khaleesi.]
The witch? I'll bring you her head, Khaleesi.

300
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:27,266
[Fichi mae anhaan ozisa che Khal Drogo achara kifindirgi yer ziganeso anhaan.]
Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you defied me.

301
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:35,314
Hyah! Hyah!

302
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:59,755
Our scouts tell us the Stark host
has moved south from the Twins

303
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:02,216
with Lord Frey's levies in tow.

304
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:04,843
They're a day's march north.

305
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:07,346
The boy may lack experience and sense,

306
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:09,932
but he does have a certain mindless...

307
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:13,602
- provincial courage.
- Ah.

308
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:19,233
Oh, do continue.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

309
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:21,735
I do hope your savages
are going to be of some use,

310
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,904
otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.

311
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:27,407
The great hairy one insisted
he must have two battle axes.

312
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:29,993
Heavy black steel, double-sided.

313
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:31,912
Shagga likes axes.

314
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:36,750
When the battle commences,
you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.

315
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:38,418
- The vanguard?
- Mm-hm.

316
00:23:38,544 --> 00:23:41,171
Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?

317
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:43,632
They do seem rather ferocious.

318
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:47,928
Ferocious?

319
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:52,766
Last night... a Moon Brother
stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage.

320
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:56,603
Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother
and opened his throat.

321
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:59,368
Bronn managed to keep Shagga
from chopping off the dead man's cock,

322
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:03,609
which was fortunate, but even still
Ulf is demanding blood money,

323
00:24:03,694 --> 00:24:06,321
which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.

324
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:09,575
When soldiers lack discipline,
the fault lies with their commander.

325
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:13,203
Surely there are ways to have me killed that
would be less detrimental to the war effort.

326
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:15,664
There'll be no more discussion on the matter.

327
00:24:21,003 --> 00:24:23,297
It appears I'm not hungry after all.

328
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,965
Excuse me, my lords.

329
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:41,190
Where did you find one so pretty
at this hour?

330
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:43,442
- I took her.
- Took her?

331
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:46,612
- From whom?
- From, uh...

332
00:24:46,695 --> 00:24:48,530
Ser... What's his name?

333
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:54,494
- I don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down.
- And he didn't have anything to say about it?

334
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:57,873
He said something.

335
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:05,714
Well, the odds of me living long enough for him
to retaliate have just dropped drastically.

336
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:08,091
We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.

337
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:12,888
Oh, well.

338
00:25:14,306 --> 00:25:18,310
I, uh...
think I'll go and find myself one.

339
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:24,316
Who are you?

340
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:26,777
Who would you like me to be?

341
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,570
What did your mother call you?

342
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:31,782
Shae. What did your mother call you?

343
00:25:31,907 --> 00:25:34,243
My mother died giving birth to me.

344
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:37,996
Is that why I'm here?
So we can talk about our mothers?

345
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:41,416
- What sort of accent is that?
- Foreign.

346
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,168
For...

347
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:46,505
What do you want from me?

348
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:49,383
What do I want from you?

349
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:52,469
I want you to share my tent.

350
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:55,556
I want you to pour my wine,
laugh at my jokes,

351
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:58,225
rub my legs when they're sore
after a day's ride.

352
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:02,396
I want you to take no other man to bed
for as long as we're together.

353
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:07,067
And I want you to fuck me
like it's my last night in this world.

354
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:09,194
Which it may well be.

355
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:10,863
And what do I get?

356
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:12,573
One - safety.

357
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:16,743
No one will hurt you
for as long as you're mine.

358
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,539
Two - the pleasure of my company,

359
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:23,250
which I have heard is spectacular.

360
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:25,544
Who told you this?
Women you paid?

361
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:27,212
And three...

362
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:31,383
more gold than you can spend
if you lived a thousand years.

363
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:35,345
Do you accept my proposal?

364
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:57,242
Let's start with your last night in this world.

365
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:31,610
Khaleesi.

366
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:32,736
Come.

367
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,282
He's very strong.

368
00:27:37,366 --> 00:27:40,118
No one understands how strong he is.

369
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:02,140
- He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
- He can't.

370
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:04,893
He can't. I won't let him.

371
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:08,105
Even a queen doesn't have that power.

372
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:14,236
We must go quickly.
I've heard there's a good port in Asshai.

373
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:18,407
- I won't leave him.
- He's already gone, Khaleesi.

374
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:20,492
Doth...

375
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:22,327
Even if...

376
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:25,831
Even if he dies...

377
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:28,375
why would I run?

378
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:34,089
I am khaleesi, and my...
my son will be khal after Drogo.

379
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:37,342
This isn't Westeros, where men honour blood.

380
00:28:37,426 --> 00:28:42,055
Here they only honour strength.
There will be fighting after Drogo dies.

381
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:44,892
Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal.

382
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:47,019
He won't want any rivals.

383
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:51,857
Your boy will be plucked from your breast
and given to the dogs.

384
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:55,694
I won't... leave him.

385
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:07,414
The wound has festered.

386
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:10,501
[Yer et jin zhey maegi.]
You did this witch.

387
00:29:10,626 --> 00:29:12,419
[Nakhi]
Stop it!

388
00:29:12,503 --> 00:29:14,161
[Anha vos zalok meme nem azzisa.]
I don't want her hurt.

389
00:29:14,171 --> 00:29:19,384
[Vos? Vos? Hash shafka vos zali meme nem azzisa?]
No? No? You don't want her hurt?

390
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:27,351
[Zali mekisha vos azzisaki shafka akka. Shafka azh jin maegaan frakhat khales kishi.]
Pray we don't hurt you, too. You let this witch put her hands on our Khal.

391
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:31,220
[Javrathi lekh. Me zin Khaleesi shafki.]
Rein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi.

392
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:34,870
[Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.]
Only while the blood of my blood lives.

393
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:41,990
[Affin me drivoe, me vosi.]
When he dies, she is nothing.

394
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:53,085
[Anha vosoon avvos. Anha qoy zhavvorsi.]
I have never been nothing. I am the blood of the dragon.

395
00:29:54,753 --> 00:30:00,592
[Ei zhavvorsa drivi, zhey Khaleesi.]
The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi.

396
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,644
I think you should wear
your armour tonight, ser.

397
00:30:11,687 --> 00:30:13,438
I think you're right.

398
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:22,656
- You've saved me once more.
- And now you must save him.

399
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:24,992
He's beyond the healer's skills.

400
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:27,494
All I can do is ease his path.

401
00:30:27,578 --> 00:30:29,788
Save him and I will free you. I swear it.

402
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:33,000
You must know a way.

403
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:34,835
Some...

404
00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:37,546
Some magic.

405
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:41,341
There is a spell.

406
00:30:42,384 --> 00:30:44,720
Some would say death is cleaner.

407
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:56,315
Do it.

408
00:30:57,149 --> 00:30:58,901
Save him.

409
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:01,820
- There is a price.
- You'll have gold, whatever you want.

410
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:04,198
It's not a matter of gold.
This is bloodmagic.

411
00:31:04,323 --> 00:31:06,325
Only death pays for life.

412
00:31:09,828 --> 00:31:11,371
My death?

413
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:14,249
No, not your death, Khaleesi.

414
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:17,628
Bring me his horse.

415
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:42,903
Khaleesi, do not do this thing.

416
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:46,323
- Let me kill this witch.
- Kill her and you kill your khal.

417
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:49,368
This is bloodmagic.
It is forbidden.

418
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:53,080
I am your khaleesi.
I tell you what is forbidden.

419
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,800
Go. Now.

420
00:32:04,883 --> 00:32:06,802
- Take her and leave.
- Uh-uh.

421
00:32:06,927 --> 00:32:08,095
Take her!

422
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:17,896
You must go also, lady. Once I begin to sing,
no one must enter the tent.

423
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:20,566
The dead will dance here tonight.

424
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:35,664
No one will enter.

425
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:46,258
Bring him back to me.

426
00:33:02,733 --> 00:33:04,443
What have you done?

427
00:33:04,526 --> 00:33:06,820
I have to save him.

428
00:33:06,904 --> 00:33:10,199
We could have been 10 miles
away from here by now, on the way to Asshai.

429
00:33:10,282 --> 00:33:12,282
You would have been safe.

430
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:20,667
[Jini'th vos eo.]
This must not be.

431
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:22,111
[Jini'th vos eo.]
This must not be.

432
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:23,670
[Jini vee.]
This must be.

433
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:25,005
[Maegi.]
Witch.

434
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,280
[Mra qothoon vosaan...]
Nothing good will come of this.

435
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:28,967
[Vos! Yer laz vos.]
No, you can't.

436
00:33:29,051 --> 00:33:30,969
Khaleesi!

437
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:34,806
[Vos alle, zhey vezhak.]
No further, horselord.

438
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:16,807
Are you hurt?

439
00:34:16,932 --> 00:34:17,891
- The baby...
- Hmm?

440
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:19,643
...is coming.

441
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:23,564
- Fetch the midwives.
- They will not come. They say she is cursed.

442
00:34:25,023 --> 00:34:27,150
They'll come or I'll have their heads.

443
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:32,072
The witch - she can bring baby.
I hear her say so.

444
00:34:55,512 --> 00:34:57,181
Are you in agony, my lion?

445
00:34:57,306 --> 00:34:59,683
- No.
- You look like you're in agony.

446
00:35:00,601 --> 00:35:03,228
The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.

447
00:35:06,857 --> 00:35:08,483
Ah!

448
00:35:10,194 --> 00:35:12,779
Damn you, woman.
Are you immune to pain?

449
00:35:12,863 --> 00:35:14,948
- Just used to it.
- Drink.

450
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:19,077
Let's play a new game.

451
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:23,165
There's a Braavosi knife game
I could teach you.

452
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:26,376
Does it involve the potential
for losing fingers?

453
00:35:26,502 --> 00:35:29,004
- Not if you win.
- No!

454
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:31,673
No fire games, no knife games.

455
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:36,637
- Let's do something I'm good at.
- What are you good at?

456
00:35:36,678 --> 00:35:38,639
I happen to be a great judge of character.

457
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,974
- This sounds like a boring game.
- It's not.

458
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:45,187
Here's how it works -
I make a statement about your past.

459
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:48,440
If I'm right, you drink.
If I'm wrong, I drink.

460
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:51,443
And no lying.
I'll know if you're lying.

461
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:53,362
I don't want to play this game.

462
00:35:53,529 --> 00:35:55,447
Fine. Bronn first.

463
00:36:00,077 --> 00:36:01,912
Your father beat you.

464
00:36:07,543 --> 00:36:09,545
But my mother hit harder.

465
00:36:13,006 --> 00:36:15,509
You killed your first man
before you were 12.

466
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:17,386
It was a woman.

467
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:22,015
She swung an axe at me.

468
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:25,394
You've been north of the Wall.

469
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:30,482
What brought you up there?

470
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:33,861
- Work.
- And...

471
00:36:34,987 --> 00:36:38,365
you once loved a woman many years ago,
but it turned out badly

472
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,284
so you've never let yourself love again.

473
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,454
Oh, wait, that's me.

474
00:36:47,749 --> 00:36:50,502
Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.

475
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:52,171
I don't want to play.

476
00:36:52,254 --> 00:36:56,049
It's fun! Look at the fun we're having.

477
00:36:59,595 --> 00:37:01,638
Your mother was a whore.

478
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:03,849
Drink.

479
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:12,524
All right.

480
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:16,028
Your father left the family when
you were very young, never to return.

481
00:37:16,153 --> 00:37:17,279
Drink.

482
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:21,366
- And we've established the rules about lying?
- Drink!

483
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:26,288
Mm.

484
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,334
You wanted a different life.

485
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:33,170
You came from somewhere
and you wanted to be elsewhere.

486
00:37:33,295 --> 00:37:35,964
The whole shit-stained world
could drink off that one.

487
00:37:36,006 --> 00:37:38,133
So, specifics...

488
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,762
You wanted to be elsewhere,
but how would you get there?

489
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:45,641
I don't believe the life
of the Silent Sisters is for you.

490
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:49,436
So... what's a low-born girl to do?

491
00:37:53,065 --> 00:37:54,316
Drink.

492
00:37:57,194 --> 00:37:58,904
- Are you sure...
- Drink!

493
00:38:04,493 --> 00:38:08,288
And don't talk about
my mother and father ever,

494
00:38:08,372 --> 00:38:10,916
or I will carve your eyes from your head.

495
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,298
My dear lady,
if I have offended you, I apologise.

496
00:38:19,508 --> 00:38:20,425
My turn.

497
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:22,636
Fine, fine.

498
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:24,221
Ask away.

499
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:28,016
Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.

500
00:38:28,058 --> 00:38:31,061
- Who were you in love with?
- That's not how the game works.

501
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:33,522
I don't care the way the game works.

502
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:35,607
Our lord here used to be married.

503
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:38,652
- Married?
- How did you hear that?

504
00:38:38,819 --> 00:38:42,114
You hear lots of things
playing dice with Lannister soldiers.

505
00:38:44,658 --> 00:38:46,243
Another night, perhaps.

506
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:49,413
Not another night. This night.

507
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:52,583
It's not a pleasant story.

508
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:56,128
Oh, maybe I will cry.

509
00:38:56,211 --> 00:39:00,757
I'm guessing the lady and I can tell more
unpleasant stories than your Lordship.

510
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:04,970
So...

511
00:39:08,348 --> 00:39:14,062
I was 16. My brother Jaime and I were riding,
when we heard a scream.

512
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:18,692
She ran out onto the road,
clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels.

513
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:23,280
Jaime scared away the men easily enough,
while I wrapped her in my cloak.

514
00:39:23,405 --> 00:39:25,199
She was too scared to send off on her own,

515
00:39:25,324 --> 00:39:30,287
so while Jaime hunted down the rapers
I took her to the nearest inn and fed her.

516
00:39:30,495 --> 00:39:32,831
Her name was Tysha.

517
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:35,167
She was a wheelwright's orphan.

518
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,461
And she was hungry.

519
00:39:37,544 --> 00:39:40,839
Together we finished off three chickens
and a flagon of wine.

520
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:45,135
Impossible as it seems, there was a time
when I was unaccustomed to wine.

521
00:39:45,177 --> 00:39:48,347
I forgot how afraid I was around girls...

522
00:39:48,472 --> 00:39:51,850
how I was always waiting
for them to laugh at me or...

523
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:53,185
look away embarrassed,

524
00:39:53,352 --> 00:39:56,063
or ask me about my tall, handsome brother.

525
00:39:56,146 --> 00:39:58,524
I forgot about everything but Tysha.

526
00:39:59,775 --> 00:40:02,569
And somehow I found myself in her bed.

527
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:05,572
For three chickens, I should hope so.

528
00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:08,742
It didn't last long.
I didn't know what the hell I was doing.

529
00:40:08,825 --> 00:40:11,203
But she was good to me.

530
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:13,288
She kissed me afterwards and...

531
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:15,791
San9 me a SOn9.

532
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:20,921
And by morning
I was deep enough in love to ask for her hand.

533
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,299
A few lies, a few gold coins,
one drunken septon

534
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:26,552
and there you have it - man and wife.

535
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:32,599
For a fortnight anyway,
until the septon sobered up and told my father.

536
00:40:32,683 --> 00:40:35,227
Well, I imagine that was the end of all that.

537
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:36,812
Not quite.

538
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,941
First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth.

539
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:45,070
The girl was a whore, you see.

540
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:51,785
Jaime had arranged the whole thing -
the road, the rapers... all of it.

541
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:54,371
He thought it was time I had a woman.

542
00:40:56,456 --> 00:40:58,542
After my brother confessed...

543
00:40:59,835 --> 00:41:01,712
my father brought in my wife

544
00:41:01,837 --> 00:41:03,755
and gave her to his guards.

545
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:08,010
He paid her well -
a silver for each man.

546
00:41:08,093 --> 00:41:11,013
How many whores command
that kind of price?

547
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:16,310
He brought me into the barracks
and made me watch.

548
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:19,730
By the end, she had so much silver

549
00:41:19,897 --> 00:41:24,568
that the coins were slipping through her fingers
and rolling on to the floor.

550
00:41:28,488 --> 00:41:31,450
I would have killed the man
who did that to me.

551
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:34,536
You should have known she was a whore.

552
00:41:35,412 --> 00:41:36,455
Really?

553
00:41:37,331 --> 00:41:39,833
I was 16, drunk and in love.

554
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:45,255
A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite
another man into her bed two hours later.

555
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,927
As I said, I was young and stupid.

556
00:41:52,554 --> 00:41:54,848
You are still young and stupid.

557
00:42:18,622 --> 00:42:20,457
Hyah!

558
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:40,519
- What is it? What do you want?
- You're sleeping through the war.

559
00:42:40,644 --> 00:42:43,397
- What?
- They stole a night's march on us.

560
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,023
They're a mile north.

561
00:42:45,774 --> 00:42:48,235
- Get my squire!
- You don't have a squire.

562
00:42:50,696 --> 00:42:52,573
If I die, weep for me.

563
00:42:53,991 --> 00:42:56,910
You will be dead.
How will you know?

564
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:05,169
I'll know.

565
00:43:07,421 --> 00:43:08,922
Watch out! Move!

566
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:11,675
Out of the way!

567
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:13,677
Move aside!

568
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,602
Stay low.

569
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:24,146
Stay low?

570
00:43:24,229 --> 00:43:26,607
If you're lucky, no one will notice you.

571
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:28,525
I was born lucky.

572
00:43:31,737 --> 00:43:34,072
Tribesmen of the Vale,

573
00:43:34,156 --> 00:43:35,490
gather round!

574
00:43:37,201 --> 00:43:39,620
Stone Crows!

575
00:43:39,703 --> 00:43:41,914
Black Ears!
Burned Men!

576
00:43:41,997 --> 00:43:44,666
- Moon Brothers!
- And Painted Dogs!

577
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:47,586
- And Painted Dogs!
- Painted Dogs!

578
00:43:47,669 --> 00:43:50,589
Your dominion over the Vale begins now!

579
00:43:50,714 --> 00:43:53,509
Onward, to claim what is yours!

580
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:55,719
Half man! Half man!

581
00:43:55,844 --> 00:43:59,181
Half man! Half man!

582
00:43:59,264 --> 00:44:01,850
Half man! Half man!

583
00:44:02,017 --> 00:44:03,852
To battle!

584
00:44:46,436 --> 00:44:47,896
You're a shit warrior.

585
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,818
I'm alive?

586
00:44:53,777 --> 00:44:55,320
You're alive.

587
00:45:00,742 --> 00:45:02,327
Did we win?

588
00:45:02,494 --> 00:45:05,122
We wouldn't be having
this conversation if we didn't.

589
00:45:18,177 --> 00:45:20,554
How did our tribesmen do?

590
00:45:21,972 --> 00:45:24,141
Yeah, good.

591
00:45:25,184 --> 00:45:29,479
- It's nice to see them getting along.
- You're wounded.

592
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:32,608
Good of you to notice.

593
00:45:33,483 --> 00:45:34,776
I hear we won.

594
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:37,446
Huh! The scouts were wrong.

595
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,200
There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20.

596
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:44,411
Did we get the Stark boy, at least?

597
00:45:44,494 --> 00:45:45,954
He wasn't here.

598
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,540
Where was he?

599
00:45:48,624 --> 00:45:51,001
With his other 18,000 men.

600
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:56,840
And where are they?

601
00:46:06,934 --> 00:46:08,894
- We should go, my lady.
- No!

602
00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:15,651
My lady!

603
00:46:17,861 --> 00:46:20,072
Hyah! Hyah!

604
00:46:51,186 --> 00:46:55,357
By the time they knew what was happening,
it had already happened.

605
00:46:58,777 --> 00:47:02,823
Lady Stark. I'd offer you my sword,
but I seem to have lost it.

606
00:47:02,948 --> 00:47:04,867
It is not your sword I want.

607
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:07,995
Give me my daughters back.

608
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,955
Give me my husband.

609
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:12,541
I've lost them too, I'm afraid.

610
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:15,127
Kill him, Robb.
Send his head to his father.

611
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:20,048
- He cut down ten of our men. You saw him.
- He's more use to us alive than dead.

612
00:47:20,132 --> 00:47:23,218
Take him away and put him in irons.

613
00:47:23,343 --> 00:47:25,846
We could end this war right now, boy,

614
00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:27,973
save thousands of lives.

615
00:47:28,098 --> 00:47:30,976
You fight for the Starks,
I fight for the Lannisters.

616
00:47:31,101 --> 00:47:33,061
Swords or lances, teeth, nails -

617
00:47:33,187 --> 00:47:36,899
choose your weapons
and let's end this here and now.

618
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:41,528
If we do it your way, kingslayer...

619
00:47:42,613 --> 00:47:44,323
you'd win.

620
00:47:47,451 --> 00:47:48,994
We're not doing it your way.

621
00:47:50,871 --> 00:47:52,748
Come on, pretty man.

622
00:48:01,673 --> 00:48:06,512
- I sent 2,000 men to their graves today.
- The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.

623
00:48:06,637 --> 00:48:09,640
Aye. But the dead won't hear them.

624
00:48:16,647 --> 00:48:19,358
One victory does not make us conquerors.

625
00:48:21,193 --> 00:48:23,278
Did we free my father?

626
00:48:24,279 --> 00:48:26,782
Did we rescue my sisters from the queen?

627
00:48:28,242 --> 00:48:31,870
Did we free the North from those
who want us on our knees?

628
00:48:37,334 --> 00:48:39,503
This war is far from over.

629
00:49:10,826 --> 00:49:12,411
Could I have one?

630
00:49:12,494 --> 00:49:14,329
A lemon one... or any of them.

631
00:49:14,413 --> 00:49:16,081
Three coppers.

632
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:20,544
- How about a nice fat pigeon?
- Oh, piss off now. Go on.

633
00:49:21,628 --> 00:49:24,464
Do you have any stale ones from yesterday?
Or any burnt ones?

634
00:49:24,548 --> 00:49:26,091
Piss off!

635
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:35,475
Hey, where's everyone going?
What's happening?

636
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:37,769
- They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.
- Who?

637
00:49:37,895 --> 00:49:39,813
The Hand of the King.

638
00:50:47,297 --> 00:50:49,466
- Traitor!
- Coward!

639
00:50:49,508 --> 00:50:51,593
Baelor.

640
00:50:51,677 --> 00:50:52,928
Baelor!

641
00:50:58,684 --> 00:51:01,353
Traitor! Traitor!

642
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:23,667
I am Eddard Stark...

643
00:51:23,792 --> 00:51:25,794
Lord of Winterfell...

644
00:51:25,878 --> 00:51:28,255
and Hand of the King.

645
00:51:37,472 --> 00:51:39,933
I come before you to confess my treason...

646
00:51:41,101 --> 00:51:43,020
in the sight of gods and men.

647
00:51:45,022 --> 00:51:46,690
I betrayed the faith of my king...

648
00:51:47,774 --> 00:51:49,818
and the trust of my friend Robert.

649
00:51:51,236 --> 00:51:53,697
I swore to protect and defend his children.

650
00:51:54,656 --> 00:51:56,700
But before his blood was cold...

651
00:51:57,701 --> 00:52:00,495
I plotted to murder his son...

652
00:52:00,621 --> 00:52:03,081
and seize the throne for myself.

653
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:19,389
Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed
bear witness to what I say...

654
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:24,520
Joffrey Baratheon...

655
00:52:25,354 --> 00:52:27,773
is the one true heir to the Iron Throne...

656
00:52:28,482 --> 00:52:31,276
by the grace of all the gods,

657
00:52:31,401 --> 00:52:33,654
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms...

658
00:52:33,737 --> 00:52:35,906
and Protector of the Realm.

659
00:52:43,372 --> 00:52:45,290
As... as we sin...

660
00:52:46,124 --> 00:52:47,793
so do we suffer.

661
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:50,963
This man has confessed his crimes...

662
00:52:51,046 --> 00:52:53,549
in sight of gods and men.

663
00:52:54,174 --> 00:52:56,802
The gods are just...

664
00:52:56,927 --> 00:53:00,389
but beloved Baelor taught us...

665
00:53:00,556 --> 00:53:02,975
they can also be merciful.

666
00:53:06,436 --> 00:53:10,524
What is to be done
with this traitor, Your Grace?

667
00:53:15,404 --> 00:53:18,490
My mother wishes me
to let Lord Eddard join the Night's Watch.

668
00:53:18,615 --> 00:53:23,954
Stripped of all titles and powers,
he would serve the realm in permanent exile.

669
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:28,125
And my Lady Sansa...
has begged mercy for her father.

670
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,215
But they have the soft hearts of women.

671
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,468
So long as I am your king...

672
00:53:38,594 --> 00:53:41,388
treason shall never go unpunished.

673
00:53:42,472 --> 00:53:43,682
Ser Ilyn...

674
00:53:44,975 --> 00:53:46,143
bring me his head!

675
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:48,353
No!

676
00:53:48,437 --> 00:53:50,314
Someone stop him!

677
00:54:01,617 --> 00:54:03,577
My son, this is madness.

678
00:54:04,494 --> 00:54:05,829
Put him down!

679
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:15,506
- Don't look!
- Let me go! Let me go!

680
00:54:15,631 --> 00:54:18,175
Shut your mouth!
Look at me! Look at me!

681
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,761
Stop! Daddy! Stop!

682
00:54:20,886 --> 00:54:22,763
- No! No!
- Traitor!

683
00:54:22,846 --> 00:54:24,181
Stop!

684
00:54:27,809 --> 00:54:29,394
Stop him! Stop!

685
00:55:10,674 --> 00:55:15,092

4
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,842
Do you remember me now, boy, eh?

5
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:16,386
Remember me?
There's a bright boy.

6
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,101
You'll be coming with me, boy,
and you'll be keeping your mouth shut.

7
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,704
- Keep your mouth shut, boy.
- I'm not a boy!

8
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:45,541
You're not a smart boy,
is that what you're trying to say?

9
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,459
Do you want to live, boy?!

10
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,423
North, boy, we're going north.

11
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,292
It had three eyes.

12
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,378
It told me to come with him, so I did.

13
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,632
We went down into the crypts
and my father was there.

14
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,635
Your father's not down there, little lord.

15
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,554
Not for many years yet.

16
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:47,186
- You're afraid. Just like Hodor.
- I'm not afraid of some hole in the ground.

17
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:50,439
You've lived beyond the Wall.
What are you scared of?

18
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,483
I'm a crippled boy and I'm willing to go.

19
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,075
That's my grandfather, Lord Rickard.

20
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:05,037
He was burned alive by the Mad King, Aerys.

21
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,957
That's Lyanna, my father's sister.

22
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,502
King Robert was supposed to marry her,

23
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,587
but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her.

24
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,965
Robert started a war to win her back.

25
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,177
He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway.

26
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,764
That's where I saw Father.

27
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,644
You see? He's not here.

28
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,363
- Here, Shaggydog.
- Rickon!

29
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,659
That beast is supposed to be
chained in the kennels!

30
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,954
- He doesn't like chains.
- What are you doing down here?

31
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:50,374
- Come back up with us.
- No, I came to see Father.

32
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:55,003
How many times have I told you?
He's in King's Landing with Sansa and Arya.

33
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,548
He was down here. I saw him.

34
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,341
Saw him when?

35
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,636
Last night, when I was sleeping.

36
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,305
Here, Shaggydog.

37
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,522
You both miss him.

38
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:18,151
It's only natural he should
be in your thoughts and dreams,

39
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,195
but that doesn't mean that...

40
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,948
Bran...

41
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,509
- My lady.
- My lady.

42
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:43,594
My lady.

43
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,928
My lady.

44
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,680
- My lady.
- My lady.

45
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,266
My lady.

46
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,191
Robb.

47
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,402
Robb.

48
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,408
Robb!

49
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,665
You've ruined your sword.

50
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:07,469
Shh! Shh!

51
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:09,638
- Shh!
- I'll kill them all.

52
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:14,643
- Every one of them.
- Shh.

53
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,311
I will kill them all.

54
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,857
My boy.

55
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:24,444
They have your sisters.

56
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,574
We have to get the girls back.

57
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,328
And then we will kill them all.

58
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:43,422

Very amusing.

71
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,861
Isn't it a funny song?

72
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:51,073
Thank you for your rendition.

73
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,742
I imagine it was even better received
at that tavern.

74
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,911
I'm so sorry, Your Grace.

75
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,121
I'll never sing it again, I swear.

76
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:00,499
Tell me, which do you favour -

77
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,460
your fingers or your tongue?

78
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:04,753
Your Grace?

79
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:06,463
Fingers or your tongue?

80
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,216
If you got to keep one, which would it be?

81
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:14,763
Or I could just cut your throat.

82
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,600
Every man needs hands, Your Grace.

83
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,394
Good.

84
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:23,188
- Tongue it is.
- Your Grace, please.

85
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,232
I won't sing, Your Grace.

86
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:28,443
Ser Ilyn, who better than you
to carry out the sentence?

87
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,988
I beg you! Please, no.

88
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,408
No!

89
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,621
Your Grace, please.
I beg you, I will never sing again!

90
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,708
- I'm done for the day.
- No!

91
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,210
I'll leave the rest of the matters to you, Mother.

92
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,882
Your Grace, please!

93
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:58,724
You look quite nice.

94
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,687
- Thank you, my lord.
- "Your Grace." I'm King now.

95
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,940
Stop! No!

96
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:10,152
Walk with me.
I want to show you something.

97
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,783
Do as you're bid, child.

98
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,710
...and as soon as you've had your blood,
I'll put a son in you.

99
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,879
Mother says that shouldn't be long.

100
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:35,093
No! Please, no!

101
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:36,970
This one's your father.

102
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:40,307
This one here.

103
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,727
Look at it and see what happens to traitors.

104
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,730
- You promised to be merciful.
- I was.

105
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,941
I gave him a clean death.

106
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:51,902
Look at him.

107
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:55,072
Please let me go home.
I won't do any treason, I swear...

108
00:10:55,197 --> 00:11:00,160
Mother says I'm still to marry you.
So you'll stay here... and obey.

109
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:03,580
Look at him!

110
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:13,966
Well?

111
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:16,051
How long do I have to look?

112
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:21,056
As long as it pleases me.

113
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,185
Do you want to see the rest?

114
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,646
If it please Your Grace.

115
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,731
That's your Septa there.

116
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:35,487
I'll tell you what,
I'm going to give you a present.

117
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:39,241
After I raise my armies
and kill your traitor brother,

118
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,910
I'm going to give you his head as well.

119
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,454
Or maybe he'll give me yours.

120
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:53,380
My mother tells me a king
should never strike his lady.

121
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,091
Ser Meryn.

122
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,948
Here, girl.

123
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:25,495
Will you obey now?

124
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:28,373
Or do you need another lesson?

125
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,170
I'll look for you in court.

126
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,800
Save yourself some pain, girl.

127
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:40,761
Give him what he wants.

128
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:44,515
You'll be needing that again.

129
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:07,955
The proper course is clear -

130
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:12,751
pledge fealty to King Renly
and move south to join our forces with his.

131
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:16,004
Renly is not the king.

132
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,590
You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord.

133
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,509
He put your father to death.

134
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:22,511
That doesn't make Renly king.

135
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:25,305
He's Robert's youngest brother.

136
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:30,394
If Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me,
Renly can't be king before Stannis.

137
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,521
Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?

138
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:35,232
- Renly is not right!
- My lords.

139
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:38,235
- If we put ourselves behind Stannis...
- My lords!

140
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,530
Here is what I say to these two kings.

141
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:46,869
Renly Baratheon is nothing to me,

142
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:49,413
nor Stannis neither.

143
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:54,334
Why should they rule over me and mine
from some flowery seat in the South?

144
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:58,297
What do they know of the Wall
or the Wolfswood?

145
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,383
Even their gods are wrong!

146
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,640
Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again?

147
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:10,809
It was the dragons we bowed to...

148
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:13,896
and now the dragons are dead!

149
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:21,695
There sits the only king
I mean to bend my knee to -

150
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,906
the King in the North!

151
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,457
I'll have peace on those terms.

152
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,084
They can keep their Red Castle

153
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,004
and their iron chair too.

154
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:41,965
The King in the North!

155
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,929
Am I your brother, now and always?

156
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,555
Now and always.

157
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,144
My sword is yours...

158
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:58,273
in victory and defeat,
from this day until my last day.

159
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,109
The King in the North!

160
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:05,030
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

161
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:07,115
The King in the North!

162
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:10,827
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

163
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,496
The King in the North!

164
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:16,583
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

165
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:18,544
The King in the North!

166
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:22,631
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

167
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,341
The King in the North!

168
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:31,265
- Lady Stark.
- I want to see him.

169
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:33,976
Now!

170
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:56,373
Leave us.

171
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:04,715
You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark.

172
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,550
Widowhood becomes you.

173
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:11,346
Your bed must be lonely.

174
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,265
Is that why you came?

175
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:18,061
I'm not at my best,
but I think I could be of service.

176
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:21,940
You slip out of that gown
and we'll see if I'm up to it.

177
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:29,364
Oh, I do like a violent woman.

178
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:33,368
I will kill you tonight, ser...

179
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:36,205
pack your head in a box
and send it to your sister.

180
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:37,748
Let me show you how...

181
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:40,250
Hit me again, over the ear.

182
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:45,380
And again and again. You're stronger
than you look. It shouldn't take long.

183
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:49,134
That is what you want the world to believe,
isn't it? That you don't fear death.

184
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:51,428
But I don't, my lady.

185
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:54,765
The dark is coming for all of us.
Why cry about it?

186
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:58,435
Because you are going
to the deepest of the seven hells,

187
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,730
- if the gods are just.
- What gods are those?

188
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:05,901
The trees your husband prayed to?

189
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:09,196
Where were the trees
when his head was getting chopped off?

190
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:13,075
If your gods are real and if they are just...

191
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:15,327
why is the world so full of injustice?

192
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,581
Because of men like you.

193
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:23,126
There are no men like me.

194
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,254
Only me.

195
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:32,761
My son Bran.

196
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:36,306
How did he come to fall from that tower?

197
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,933
I pushed him out the window.

198
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:42,896
Why?

199
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:47,442
I... hoped the fall would kill him.

200
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:48,944
Why?

201
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:59,288
You should get some sleep.

202
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:01,623
It's going to be a long war.

203
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:28,984
I can't believe we're actually at war.

204
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,322
Was it this exciting last time,
when you were young?

205
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:39,161
What does it say?

206
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,789
Have we captured Robb Stark yet?

207
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,167
- What's our next move?
- Stop talking.

208
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:48,378
Get back into bed.

209
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:58,347
They have my son.

210
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:04,269
The Stark boy appears
to be less green than we'd hoped.

211
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:07,648
I've heard his wolf killed a dozen men
and as many horses.

212
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:09,358
Is it true about Stannis and Renly?

213
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:12,152
Both Baratheon brothers
have taken up against us.

214
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:14,738
Jaime captured, his armies scattered...

215
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,657
it's a catastrophe.

216
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:19,660
Perhaps we should sue for peace.

217
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:25,832
There's your peace.

218
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:29,628
Joffrey saw to that when he decided
to remove Ned Stark's head.

219
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:32,840
You'll have an easier time
drinking from that cup

220
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:35,968
than you will bringing Robb Stark
to the table now.

221
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,511
He's winning...

222
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:41,807
- in case you hadn't noticed.
- I'm told we still have his sisters.

223
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,268
The first order of business
is ransoming Ser Jaime.

224
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:47,604
No truces. We can't afford to look weak.
We should march on them at once.

225
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:49,940
First we must return to Casterly Rock
to raise...

226
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,484
They have my son!

227
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,197
Get out, all of you.

228
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:09,877
Not you.

229
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,603
You were right about Eddard Stark.

230
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:35,694
If he were alive, we could have used him to
broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun,

231
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:41,283
which would have given us more time
to deal with Robert's brothers. But now...

232
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:44,286
Madness. Madness and stupidity.

233
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:50,292
I always thought you were a stunted fool.

234
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:54,129
Perhaps I was wrong.

235
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:55,923
Half wrong.

236
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:59,927
I'm new to strategy, but...

237
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:04,014
Unless we want to be surrounded
by three armies, it appears we can't stay here.

238
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:06,808
No one will stay here.

239
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:09,561
Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders

240
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:13,732
and set the Riverland on fire
from God's Eye to the Red Fork.

241
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:16,860
The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal.

242
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:21,240
And you will go to King's Landing.

243
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:24,701
- And do what?
- Rule.

244
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:29,039
You will serve as Hand of the King
in my stead.

245
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:32,334
You will bring that boy king to heel,
and his mother too, if needs be.

246
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:36,088
And if you get so much as a whim of treason
from any of the rest -

247
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:39,216
- Baelish, Varys, Pycelle...
- Heads, spikes, walls.

248
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:42,678
Why not my uncle?

249
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:45,013
Why not anyone? Why me?

250
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,474
You're my son.

251
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:57,234
Oh, one more thing.

252
00:21:57,276 --> 00:22:00,612
You will not take that whore to court.

253
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:02,406
Do you understand?

254
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:23,719
Ser Jorah?

255
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:30,893
Gently, gently.

256
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:34,396
My son...

257
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:36,857
Where is he? I want him.

258
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:41,278
Where is he?

259
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:45,574
The boy did not live.

260
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:55,459
- Tell me.
- What is there to tell?

261
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:57,836
How did my son die?

262
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:02,424
He never lived, my princess.

263
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:04,009
The women say...

264
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:06,261
What do the women say?

265
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:13,852
- They say the child was...
- Monstrous, twisted.

266
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:15,854
I pulled him out myself.

267
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:19,983
He was scaled like a lizard,

268
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:24,321
blind, with leather wings
like the wings of a bat.

269
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:27,491
When I touched him
the skin fell from his bones.

270
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:31,370
Inside... he was full of graveworms.

271
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:38,335
I warned you that only death
can pay for life.

272
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:40,337
You knew the price.

273
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:43,340
Where is Khal Drogo?

274
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:45,509
Show him to me.

275
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:51,014
Show me what I bought with my son's life.

276
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:53,100
As you command, lady.

277
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:56,645
Come. I will take you to him.

278
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,565
- Time enough for that later...
- I want to see him now.

279
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:17,541
The khalasar is gone.

280
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:20,377
A khal who cannot ride is no khal.

281
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:23,130
The Dothraki follow only the strong.

282
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:26,133
I'm sorry, my Princess.

283
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:39,354
Drogo!

284
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:42,828
[Shekh ma shieraki anni!]
My sun and stars.

285
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,568
Why is he out here alone?

286
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:47,529
He seems to like the warmth, Princess.

287
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:53,577
He lives.

288
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,705
You asked for life, you paid for life.

289
00:24:56,788 --> 00:25:00,000
This is not life.
When will he be as he was?

290
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:03,170
When the sun rises in the west,
sets in the east.

291
00:25:03,295 --> 00:25:08,217
When the seas go dry. When the mountains
blow in the wind like leaves.

292
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:25,266
Leave us.

293
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:29,035
I don't want you alone with this sorceress.

294
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,252
I have nothing more to fear
from this woman.

295
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:35,160
Go.

296
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:44,253
You knew what I was buying
and you knew the price.

297
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:46,964
It was wrong of them to burn my temple.

298
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:50,592
- It angered the Great Shepherd.
- This is not God's work.

299
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:53,679
- My child was innocent.
- Innocent?

300
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:56,765
He would have been the stallion
who mounts the world.

301
00:25:56,849 --> 00:26:01,061
Now he will burn no cities. Now his khalasar
will trample no nations into dust.

302
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:03,605
I spoke for you.

303
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,775
- I saved you.
- Saved me?

304
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:13,532
Three of those riders had already
raped me before you saved me, girl.

305
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:18,996
I saw my god's house burn,

306
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:23,625
there where I had healed men and women
beyond counting.

307
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,044
In the streets I saw piles of heads...

308
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,505
the head of the baker who makes my bread,

309
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:32,926
the head of a young boy that I had
cured of fever just three moons past.

310
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:38,223
So... tell me again
exactly what it was that you saved?

311
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:40,267
Your life.

312
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:44,813
Why don't you take a look at your khal...

313
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:49,526
Then you will see exactly
what life is worth...

314
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:52,321
when all the rest has gone.

315
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,668
You can't!

316
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,546
Get out of my way, Sam.

317
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:11,548
They'll put out the word.

318
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:15,219
They'll send out ravens.
People will come after you.

319
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:18,180
Do you know what happens to deserters?

320
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:22,351
Better than you do.

321
00:27:23,227 --> 00:27:24,978
What are you going to do?

322
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:27,022
I'm gonna find my brother

323
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:29,942
and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat.

324
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:34,530
You can't leave us now.
We need you here.

325
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:38,408
- Move.
- I won't let you go.

326
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:41,203
- Move.
- No.

327
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,789
Hyah!

328
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:01,598
Hand of the King?

329
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:03,809
So it would seem.

330
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:08,313
And your father said you couldn't
take anyone with you to King's Landing?

331
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:11,066
No, he said I couldn't take you with me
to King's Landing.

332
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:14,987
- He was very specific on that point.
- He knew my name?

333
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:16,697
What?

334
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,408
He said,
"Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing"?

335
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,369
I believe he used the word "whore".

336
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:25,539
Are you ashamed of me?

337
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:28,750
Are you afraid that I'm dancing around
the court with my tits out?

338
00:28:30,544 --> 00:28:31,712
I'm funny now?

339
00:28:31,837 --> 00:28:33,964
I'm Shae, the funny whore.

340
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,218
My father's probably the most powerful man
in the country.

341
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:39,803
Certainly the richest.

342
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:42,347
He has all seven kingdoms in his pockets.

343
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:47,352
Everyone everywhere always has to do
exactly what my father says.

344
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:50,772
He's always been a cunt.

345
00:28:57,905 --> 00:29:01,158
I believe the ladies of the court
could learn a great deal

346
00:29:01,283 --> 00:29:02,993
from a girl like you.

347
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,333
Why don't you come with me,
be the Hand's lady?

348
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:14,046
Because the king needs a Hand
and the Hand...

349
00:29:17,883 --> 00:29:20,052
I know what a Hand needs.

350
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:34,900
Ghost?

351
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:36,109
Hyah!

352
00:29:36,235 --> 00:29:38,570
Hyah! Hyah!

353
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:43,033
Hyah!

354
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:49,039
Samwell!

355
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:53,043
- Is he dead?
- No, he's not dead.

356
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:54,753
Did we get him?

357
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:56,672
Come on, help me get him up.

358
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:02,177
Lucky you've got plenty of padding.

359
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:06,223
We're taking you back to where you belong.

360
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:08,892
- I belong with my brother.
- But we're your brothers now.

361
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:10,857
They'll kill you if they find out you've gone.

362
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:13,230
They'll kill you if they know
you came after me.

363
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:16,400
- Go back.
- Sam told us everything.

364
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:19,111
- We're sorry about your father.
- But it doesn't matter.

365
00:30:19,236 --> 00:30:21,572
You took the oath. You can't leave.

366
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:23,699
- I have to.
- You can't.

367
00:30:23,866 --> 00:30:26,159
- You said the words.
- I don't care about...

368
00:30:26,285 --> 00:30:29,413
"Hear my words
and bear witness to my vow..."

369
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:33,750
- To hell with all of you.
- "Night gathers and now my watch begins.

370
00:30:33,876 --> 00:30:37,004
"It shall not end until my death.

371
00:30:37,129 --> 00:30:39,089
"I shall live and die at my post."

372
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:40,924
"I am the sword in the darkness..."

373
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:42,801
"The watcher on the walls..."

374
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:45,554
"The shield that guards the realms of men.

375
00:30:45,637 --> 00:30:49,308
"I pledge my life and honour
to the Night's Watch,

376
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:53,103
"for this night and all nights to come."

377
00:31:32,726 --> 00:31:37,486
[Hash yer vineseri dothrakh ataki kishi, zhey shekh ma shieraki anni?]
Do you remember our first ride, my sun and stars?

378
00:31:41,193 --> 00:31:45,794
[Hash yer laz chari anna; hash yer ray vos o, attihas anna.]
if you are in there, if you haven't gone away, show me.

379
00:31:48,325 --> 00:31:53,205
[Yer lajak. Yer ayyeyoon lajakoon.]
You're a fighter. You've always been a fighter.

380
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:56,625
[Anha zigerek yeroon lajat ajjin.]
I need you to fight now.

381
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:09,680
[Affin shekh yola,]
I know you're very far away,

382
00:32:09,763 --> 00:32:14,601
[affin mae drae fey, shekh ma shieraki anni.]
but come back to me, my sun and stars.

383
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,334
When the sun...

384
00:32:39,418 --> 00:32:41,920
rises in the west...

385
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:45,424
...and sets in the east...

386
00:32:48,844 --> 00:32:52,055
...then you shall return to me,
my sun and stars.

387
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:00,958
Kings?

388
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:05,796
Oh, I can tell you all there is
to know about kings.

389
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:10,926
The thing you need to understand
about kings is...

390
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:19,685
For the past 6T years, I've known...

391
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:24,648
truly known...
more kings than any man alive.

392
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:30,737
They're complicated men,
but I know how to serve them.

393
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:32,781
Yes.

394
00:34:32,865 --> 00:34:35,284
And keep on serving them.

395
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:39,788
Aerys Targaryen.

396
00:34:41,707 --> 00:34:46,211
Of all the thousand thousand maladies
the gods visit on us...

397
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:49,506
madness is the worst.

398
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:52,551
He was a good man.

399
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,679
Such a charmer.

400
00:34:56,805 --> 00:34:59,391
To watch him melt away before my eyes...

401
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:04,855
consumed by dreams of fire and blood...

402
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,612
Robert Baratheon
was an entirely different animal -

403
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:14,406
powerful man, great warrior -

404
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:20,495
but alas, winning a kingdom
and ruling a kingdom

405
00:35:20,621 --> 00:35:22,873
are rather different things.

406
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:24,458
They say that...

407
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:28,045
if a man goes through life
with his battle visor down,

408
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:33,509
he can often be blind
to the enemies at his side.

409
00:35:34,343 --> 00:35:38,180
Now I serve his son...

410
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:40,682
King Joffrey...

411
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:43,352
may the gods bless his reign.

412
00:35:44,728 --> 00:35:48,690
He is a capable young man -
strong military mind.

413
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:50,901
Stern.

414
00:35:51,944 --> 00:35:55,322
But sternness in defence of the realm
is no vice.

415
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:01,328
It's far too soon to know
what manner of king he will be, but...

416
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:07,459
I sense true greatness on the horizon
for our new king.

417
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:09,211
Mmm.

418
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:11,588
True greatness.

419
00:36:15,968 --> 00:36:17,886
So what's the thing?

420
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:21,348
What thing?

421
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:23,225
About kings.

422
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:27,145
You said, "The thing you
need to understand about kings..."

423
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:29,147
What? Things? What?

424
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:32,317
When you started, you...
Never mind.

425
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:35,904
Let me see you out, my dear.

426
00:36:35,988 --> 00:36:38,991
- It's all right. No need.
- Yes, yes.

427
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:41,159
Till the next time.

428
00:37:01,763 --> 00:37:03,223
Right.

429
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,878
When you imagine yourself up there,
how do you look?

430
00:37:33,462 --> 00:37:35,297
Does the crown fit?

431
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,633
Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow,

432
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:40,719
the ones who sneered at you for years?

433
00:37:40,802 --> 00:37:44,181
It's hard for them to simper and bow
without heads.

434
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:47,768
A man with great ambition and no morals -

435
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:50,479
I wouldn't bet against you.

436
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:56,527
And what would you do, my friend,
if you found yourself sitting up there?

437
00:37:56,652 --> 00:38:00,030
I must be one of the few men in this city
who doesn't want to be King.

438
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:03,700
You must be one of the few men in the city
who isn't a man.

439
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:05,410
Oh, you can do better than that.

440
00:38:09,998 --> 00:38:13,377
When they castrated you,
did they take the pillar with the stones?

441
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,295
- I've always wondered.
- Have you?

442
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,590
Do you spend a lot of time
wondering what's between my legs?

443
00:38:18,674 --> 00:38:23,804
I picture... a gash. Like a woman's.
Is that about right?

444
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:26,765
I am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all.

445
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:30,686
Must be strange for you,
even after all these years...

446
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:33,605
a man from another land,

447
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,024
despised by most,

448
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:37,401
feared by all...

449
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:39,111
Am I? That is good to know.

450
00:38:39,194 --> 00:38:42,573
Do you lie awake at night
fearing my gash?

451
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:44,741
But you carry on...

452
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:48,912
whispering in one king's ear
and then the next.

453
00:38:51,164 --> 00:38:52,958
I admire you.

454
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:56,336
And I admire you, Lord Baelish.

455
00:38:56,461 --> 00:39:00,883
A grasper from a minor House with
a major talent for befriending powerful men...

456
00:39:00,966 --> 00:39:04,011
- and women.
- A useful talent, I'm sure you'd agree.

457
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:08,348
So...

458
00:39:08,473 --> 00:39:10,475
here we stand...

459
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:13,061
in mutual admiration and respect.

460
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,230
Playing our roles.

461
00:39:15,355 --> 00:39:16,690
Serving a new king.

462
00:39:16,732 --> 00:39:19,109
Long may he reign.

463
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:21,361
- My king.
- My king.

464
00:39:22,696 --> 00:39:25,782
My lords. Shall we begin?

465
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:28,702
You're Arry now, hear me?

466
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:30,746
Arry the orphan boy.

467
00:39:30,913 --> 00:39:35,501
No one asks an orphan too many questions,
cos nobody gives three shits.

468
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:37,503
What's your name?

469
00:39:37,586 --> 00:39:38,795
Arry.

470
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:42,508
You've a long way to travel,
and in bad company.

471
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:46,803
I've 20 this time -
men and boys all bound for the Wall.

472
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:50,182
Your lord father gave me
the pick of the dungeons,

473
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:53,560
and I didn't find no little lordlings
down there.

474
00:39:53,644 --> 00:39:54,978
This lot -

475
00:39:55,103 --> 00:39:58,941
half of them would turn you over to the king
quick as spit for a pardon.

476
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:03,111
And the other half would do the same,
except they'd rape you first.

477
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:07,783
So keep to yourself -
and when you piss, do it in the woods alone.

478
00:40:09,243 --> 00:40:11,537
You stay with this lot, boy.

479
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:13,163
And stay...

480
00:40:13,288 --> 00:40:16,959
or I'll lock you in the back of the wagon
with these three.

481
00:40:21,672 --> 00:40:23,298
Watch yourself, midget.

482
00:40:24,925 --> 00:40:26,009
He's got a sword, this one.

483
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:28,679
What's a gutter rat like you
doing with a sword?

484
00:40:28,846 --> 00:40:31,765
- Maybe he's a little squire.
- He ain't no squire. Look at him.

485
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:33,475
He looks like a girl.

486
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,686
I bet he stole that sword.

487
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:38,146
Let's have a look.

488
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:42,693
I could use me a sword like that.

489
00:40:42,818 --> 00:40:45,153
- Take it off him.
- Give it here, midget.

490
00:40:45,237 --> 00:40:48,031
Look at him.
You'd better give Hot Pie the sword.

491
00:40:48,156 --> 00:40:49,992
I've seen him kick a boy to death.

492
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:52,286
I knocked him down
and I kicked him in the balls

493
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:54,663
and I kept kicking him
until he was dead.

494
00:40:54,746 --> 00:40:56,582
I kicked him all to pieces.

495
00:40:58,166 --> 00:41:01,211
- You better give me that sword!
- You want it?

496
00:41:01,295 --> 00:41:03,005
I'll give it to you.

497
00:41:03,046 --> 00:41:05,757
I already killed one fat boy.

498
00:41:05,883 --> 00:41:08,260
I bet you never killed anyone.

499
00:41:08,385 --> 00:41:11,096
I bet you're a liar. But I'm not.

500
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:13,098
I'm good at killing fat boys.

501
00:41:13,182 --> 00:41:14,850
I like killing fat boys.

502
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:19,021
You like picking on the little ones, do you?

503
00:41:19,062 --> 00:41:21,815
I've been hammering an anvil
these past 10 years.

504
00:41:21,982 --> 00:41:24,318
When I hit that steel, it sings.

505
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:27,196
Are you gonna sing when I hit you?

506
00:41:33,785 --> 00:41:36,079
This is castle-forged steel.

507
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:38,290
Where'd you steal it?

508
00:41:38,373 --> 00:41:41,084
- It was a gift.
- It don't matter now.

509
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:43,629
Where we're going,
they don't care what you've done.

510
00:41:43,712 --> 00:41:47,090
They've got rapers,
pickpockets, highwaymen...

511
00:41:47,174 --> 00:41:48,634
murderers.

512
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:52,054
- Which are you?
- Armourer's apprentice.

513
00:41:53,514 --> 00:41:57,226
But my master got sick of me, so...
here I am.

514
00:41:57,267 --> 00:42:00,437
Come on, you sorry sons of whores!

515
00:42:00,646 --> 00:42:03,857
It's a thousand leagues from here
to the Wall!

516
00:42:03,941 --> 00:42:06,401
And winter is coming!

517
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:39,226
Ham.

518
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:44,189
How many days in a row must a man
be expected to start his day with ham?

519
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:47,067
Bring me some beer at least.

520
00:42:49,194 --> 00:42:51,113
You look exhausted.

521
00:42:51,238 --> 00:42:53,240
Was your moonlight ride that tiring?

522
00:42:56,994 --> 00:42:58,787
Don't look so terrified.

523
00:42:58,954 --> 00:43:01,540
If we beheaded everyone
that ran away for the night,

524
00:43:01,665 --> 00:43:04,376
only ghosts would guard the Wall.

525
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,838
At least you weren't whoring in Mole's Town.

526
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:10,591
Honour made you leave,

527
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:12,384
honour brought you back.

528
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:15,429
My friends brought me back.

529
00:43:16,346 --> 00:43:18,515
I didn't say it was your honour.

530
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:23,270
- They killed my father.
- And you're gonna bring him back to life?

531
00:43:23,395 --> 00:43:25,522
No? Good.

532
00:43:25,647 --> 00:43:28,358
We've had enough of that sort of thing.

533
00:43:29,484 --> 00:43:34,156
Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are
reporting whole villages abandoned.

534
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:37,326
At night they see fires
blazing in the mountains

535
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:39,578
from dusk until dawn.

536
00:43:39,661 --> 00:43:44,124
A captured wildling swears their tribes
are uniting in some secret stronghold,

537
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:47,794
to what ends the gods only know.

538
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:51,215
Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men

539
00:43:51,298 --> 00:43:53,550
discovered four blue-eyed corpses.

540
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:57,721
Unlike us, they were wise enough
to burn them.

541
00:43:59,932 --> 00:44:05,479
Do you think your brother's war
is more important than ours?

542
00:44:06,813 --> 00:44:07,814
No.

543
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,735
When dead men and worse
come hunting for us in the night,

544
00:44:11,818 --> 00:44:15,739
do you think it matters
who sits on the Iron Throne?

545
00:44:16,573 --> 00:44:18,909
- No.
- Good.

546
00:44:19,034 --> 00:44:21,662
Because I want you
and your wolf with us

547
00:44:21,787 --> 00:44:24,706
when we ride out
beyond the Wall tomorrow.

548
00:44:25,374 --> 00:44:27,417
Beyond the Wall?

549
00:44:27,543 --> 00:44:30,546
I'll not sit meekly by...
and wait for the snows.

550
00:44:31,421 --> 00:44:33,590
I mean to find out what's happening.

551
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:36,635
The Night's Watch will ride in force

552
00:44:36,718 --> 00:44:40,931
against the wildlings, the white walkers
and whatever else is out there.

553
00:44:43,767 --> 00:44:46,311
And we will find Benjen Stark,

554
00:44:46,436 --> 00:44:47,980
alive or dead.

555
00:44:49,189 --> 00:44:51,149
I will command them myself.

556
00:44:52,234 --> 00:44:54,820
So I'll only ask you once, Lord Snow...

557
00:44:55,821 --> 00:44:56,780
Move out!

558
00:44:56,864 --> 00:44:59,491
...are you a brother of
the Night's Watch

559
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:03,203
or a bastard boy
who wants to play at war?

560
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:38,947
Is this your command, Khaleesi?

561
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,499
Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs
in the Night Lands.

562
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:54,713
Sell them. You can return to the free cities
and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.

563
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:56,882
They were not given to me to sell.

564
00:46:03,138 --> 00:46:05,474
Khaleesi, my Queen...

565
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:09,061
I vow to serve you, obey you,

566
00:46:09,186 --> 00:46:11,063
to die for you if need be...

567
00:46:12,147 --> 00:46:14,483
but let him go, Khaleesi.

568
00:46:14,608 --> 00:46:16,777
I know what you intend. Do not.

569
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,570
I must.

570
00:46:19,655 --> 00:46:21,823
You don't understand...

571
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:25,869
Don't ask me to stand aside
as you climb on that pyre.

572
00:46:25,994 --> 00:46:27,746
I won't watch you burn.

573
00:46:29,373 --> 00:46:31,416
Is that what you fear?

574
00:46:50,686 --> 00:46:52,896
You will be my khalasar.

575
00:46:54,731 --> 00:46:57,109
I see the faces of slaves.

576
00:46:58,235 --> 00:46:59,611
I free you.

577
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:04,658
Take off your collars.
Go if you wish, no one will stop you.

578
00:47:04,741 --> 00:47:06,285
But if you stay...

579
00:47:07,286 --> 00:47:10,914
it will be as brothers and sisters,

580
00:47:10,998 --> 00:47:13,292
as husbands and wives.

581
00:47:25,053 --> 00:47:27,514
Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre.

582
00:47:30,225 --> 00:47:32,102
You swore to obey me.

583
00:47:41,195 --> 00:47:44,072
I am Daenerys Stormborn...

584
00:47:44,823 --> 00:47:46,992
of House Targaryen...

585
00:47:47,075 --> 00:47:48,994
of the blood of old Valyria.

586
00:47:49,077 --> 00:47:51,872
I am the Dragon's Daughter.

587
00:47:51,997 --> 00:47:54,333
And I swear to you...

588
00:47:54,374 --> 00:47:58,170
that those who would harm you
will die screaming.

589
00:47:58,295 --> 00:48:00,964
- You will not hear me scream.
- I will.

590
00:48:03,759 --> 00:48:05,802
But it is not your screams I want.

591
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:08,889
Only your life.

592
00:50:39,498 --> 00:50:41,248
Blood of my blood.

593
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:34,728
OMG, DRAGONS! THREE DRAGONS, MAN!! THREE FUCKING DRAGONS!!!
Sync, corrected & Dothraki dialogue by <font color="#3333FF">MALAY DEV</font>


1
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,134
Well struck.

2
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,886
Well struck, dog.

3
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:22,725
Did you like that?

4
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,685
It was well struck, Your Grace.

5
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,230
I already said it was well struck.

6
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:30,191
Yes, Your Grace.

7
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,201
- Who's next?
- Lothor Brune,

8
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,496
freerider in the service of Lord Baelish.

9
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,749
Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard.

10
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,463
Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard!

11
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:53,965
Here I am.

12
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,050
Here I am.

13
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,891
Sorry, Your Grace.

14
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,686
My deepest apologies.

15
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,396
- Are you drunk?
- No.

16
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,190
No. No, Your Grace.

17
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:13,860
- I had two cups of wine.
- Two cups?

18
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,862
That's not much at all.

19
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,573
Please, have another cup.

20
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,116
Are you sure, Your Grace?

21
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,493
Yes. To celebrate my name day.

22
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:24,996
Have two. Have as much as you like.

23
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,915
I would be honored, Your Grace.

24
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:32,628
Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos
celebrate my name day.

25
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,755
See that he drinks his fill.

26
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,901
You can't.

27
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,111
What did you say?

28
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,239
Did you say I can't?

29
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,908
I only meant

30
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,869
it would be bad luck
to kill a man on your name day.

31
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,121
What kind of stupid peasant's superstition...

32
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,040
The girl is right.

33
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:12,418
What a man sows on his name day,
he reaps all year.

34
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,381
Take him away.

35
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,508
I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool.

36
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,140
He is a fool. You're so clever to see it.

37
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,393
He'll make a much better fool than a knight.

38
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:32,480
He doesn't deserve
the mercy of a quick death.

39
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,984
Did you hear my lady, Ser Dontos?

40
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:40,112
From this day, you'll be my new fool.

41
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,406
Thank you, Your Grace.

42
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,618
And you, my lady, thank you.

43
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,370
Beloved nephew.

44
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,421
We looked for you on the battlefield.

45
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:02,051
You were nowhere to be found.

46
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,638
I've been here, ruling the kingdoms.

47
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,391
What a fine job you've done.

48
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:10,559
Look at you.

49
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:14,188
More beautiful than ever.

50
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,982
And you!

51
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,317
You're going to be bigger than the Hound,

52
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,820
but much better looking.

53
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,822
This one doesn't like me.

54
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,740
Can't imagine why.

55
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,326
- We heard you were dead.
- I'm glad you're not dead.

56
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,997
Me, too, dear. Death is so boring,

57
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:34,375
especially now,
with so much excitement in the world.

58
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,711
My lady, I'm sorry for your loss.

59
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,839
Her loss?

60
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,841
Her father was a confessed traitor.

61
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,509
But still her father.

62
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,262
Surely, having so recently lost your own
beloved father, you can sympathize.

63
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,436
My father was a traitor.

64
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,396
My mother and brother are traitors, too.

65
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,982
I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.

66
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,944
Of course you are.

67
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:07,825
Well, enjoy your name day, Your Grace.

68
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,577
Wish I could stay and celebrate,

69
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,455
but there is work to be done.

70
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,540
What work?

71
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,584
Why are you here?

72
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:24,675
A raven arrived from the citadel
this morning, Your Grace.

73
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,595
The conclave has met,

74
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:31,140
considered reports from maesters
all over the Seven Kingdoms,

75
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,351
and declared this great summer

76
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,271
done at last.

77
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,149
The longest summer in living memory.

78
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,778
The peasants say, a long summer means
an even longer winter.

79
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,613
A common superstition.

80
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:48,074
We have enough wheat for a five-year winter.

81
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,493
If it lasts any longer,

82
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,037
we'll have fewer peasants.

83
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,499
The city's drowning in refugees,
Your Grace, fleeing the war.

84
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,627
We have nowhere to house them.
And with winter coming, it'll only get worse.

85
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:03,005
You command the city watch,
do you not, Lord Slynt?

86
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,092
I do, Your Grace.

87
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,177
And are you not a lord at my command?

88
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,847
I owe my title and lands
to your generosity, Your Grace.

89
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,433
Then do your job.
Shut the gates to the peasants.

90
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:17,436
They belong in the field, not our capital.

91
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,105
Yes, Your Grace.

92
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:26,904
Don't get up.

93
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:31,951
More ravishing than ever, big sister.

94
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,913
War agrees with you.

95
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,541
Forgive the interruption. Carry on.

96
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,502
What are you doing here?

97
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,214
It's been a remarkable journey.

98
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:48,884
I pissed off the edge of the Wall,

99
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,804
I slept in a sky cell,

100
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,056
I fought with the hill tribes.

101
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,683
So many adventures,

102
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,520
so much to be thankful for.

103
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:03,482
What are you doing here?
This is the small council.

104
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:08,320
Yes, well, I do believe the Hand of the King
is welcome at all small council meetings.

105
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,114
Our father is Hand of the King.

106
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,200
Yes, but in his absence...

107
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,877
Your father has named Lord Tyrion

108
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,504
to serve as hand in his stead while he fights.

109
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:28,007
Out! All of you out!

110
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,556
I would like to know
how you tricked Father into this.

111
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,185
If I were capable of tricking Father,
I'd be emperor of the world by now.

112
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:41,812
You brought this on yourself.

113
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,314
I've done nothing.

114
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,191
Quite right, you did nothing

115
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,526
when your son called for Ned Stark's head.

116
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,528
Now the entire North has risen up against us.

117
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:52,031
- I tried to stop it.
- Did you? You failed.

118
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,326
That bit of theater
will haunt our family for a generation.

119
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,288
- Robb Stark is a child.
- Who's won every battle he's fought.

120
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,707
Do you understand we're losing the war?

121
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,877
- What do you know about warfare?
- Nothing.

122
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,712
But I know people.

123
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:11,467
And I know that our enemies hate each other
almost as much as they hate us.

124
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,724
- Joffrey is king.
- Joffrey is king.

125
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,143
You are here to advise him.

126
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,895
I'm only here to advise him.

127
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,481
And if the king listens to what I say,

128
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,068
the king might just get his Uncle Jaime back.

129
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,321
How?

130
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,948
You love your children.

131
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:37,076
It's your one redeeming quality.
That and your cheekbones.

132
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,413
The Starks love their children as well.

133
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,707
- And we have two of them.
- One.

134
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:48,420
- One?
- Arya, little animal, she disappeared.

135
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,507
Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke?

136
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,553
We had three Starks to trade.

137
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,265
You chopped one's head off
and let another escape.

138
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,351
Father will be furious.

139
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,979
It must be odd for you

140
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,942
to be the disappointing child.

141
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,245
My lord, may the old gods
watch over your brother

142
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,956
and all our Northern sons.

143
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,876
The walls of my holdfast
will not stand the winter.

144
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:32,089
The stones were last mortared
in the time of King Aerys,

145
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:36,760
and I'm afraid the masons today
are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers.

146
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,596
When I was a boy,

147
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:45,060
I remember seeing them put up a new tower
at Torrhen's Square in a summer.

148
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,104
Men worked back then.

149
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:52,484
Today, my holdfast looks like it was built
by drunk children.

150
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:56,655
At night you can hear the wind
howling through the gaps.

151
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,991
Gods forbid it rains.

152
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,910
Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall.

153
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:06,915
Maintenance of a holdfast generally falls
to the lord of that holdfast.

154
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,500
Generally, yes,

155
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:12,004
but I've sent all the young men off
to fight Robb Stark's war.

156
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,215
King Robb. And it's not his war.

157
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,176
He didn't choose it.

158
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,763
Maybe not, my lord,
but he called in his banners and took the men.

159
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,514
Joffrey killed my father,

160
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,017
your liege lord.

161
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,478
Do you remember your vows, ser?

162
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,396
Of course I remember!

163
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,524
We can spare four masons
for a week, my lord.

164
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,569
Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?

165
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,696
I believe it will.

166
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,622
We didn't want him here all day, did we?

167
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,501
I didn't like the way
he was talking about Robb.

168
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,252
Nor did I.

169
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,591
But listening to people
you'd rather not listen to

170
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:01,553
is one of your responsibilities
as Lord of Winterfell.

171
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,892
Lord Portan.

172
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,895
My lord, may the old gods
watch over your brother

173
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,647
and all our Northern sons.

174
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:04,032
Boil this for an hour and drink the tea.

175
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,536
Makes all your pain go away.

176
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,121
Don't have any pain.

177
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:11,707
Lucky for you.

178
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,293
That way.

179
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,798
You've been having those dreams again.

180
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,550
I don't dream.

181
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,135
Everyone dreams.

182
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,803
I don't.

183
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,223
Heard some of the men
talking about the comet.

184
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,517
They say it's an omen.

185
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:34,021
They say it means Robb
will win a great victory in the South.

186
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,564
Did they?

187
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,153
I heard some other fools say
it's Lannister Red.

188
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,406
Means the Lannisters
will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long.

189
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:47,951
Heard a stable boy say it's the color of blood

190
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,204
to mark the death of your father.

191
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,336
The stars don't fall for men.

192
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,880
Red comet means one thing, boy.

193
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,591
Dragons.

194
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:07,346
The dragons are all dead.

195
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,765
They've been dead for centuries.

196
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,053
Mmm.

197
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,727
What did your brother say
about them, Khaleesi?

198
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,479
He said they ate meat.

199
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,148
He didn't tell you what kind of meat?

200
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:04,236
My brother didn't know
anything about dragons.

201
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,322
He didn't know anything about anything.

202
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,412
Eh.

203
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,233
She was Drogo's first gift to me.

204
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,028
I remember.

205
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,782
I promised to protect them.

206
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,118
Promised them
their enemies would die screaming.

207
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,579
How do I make starvation scream?

208
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,373
A trick I never learned, I'm afraid.

209
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,711
Does it ever end?

210
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,630
This is further east than I've ever been.

211
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,799
But, yes, Khaleesi,
everything ends, even the Red Waste.

212
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,302
And you're sure there's no other way?

213
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,013
If we go south to the land of the Lhazareen,

214
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,599
the Lamb Men will kill us
and take your dragons.

215
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,476
If we go west to the Dothraki Sea,

216
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,146
the first khalasar we meet
will kill us and take your dragons.

217
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,649
No one will take my dragons.

218
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,653
They are too weak to fight,

219
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,821
as are your people.

220
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,990
You must be their strength.

221
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,035
As you are mine.

222
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:51,677
Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro.
Take our remaining horses.

223
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:56,181
You will ride east, you southeast,
and you northeast.

224
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,559
What do we seek, Khaleesi?

225
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:05,774
Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people.
Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea.

226
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:11,446
Find how far the Red Waste extends
before us, and what lies on the other side.

227
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,750
Rakharo.

228
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,796
You are my last hope, blood of my blood.

229
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:31,383
I will not fail you, blood of my blood.

230
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,302
You never have.

231
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,769
This is bad time to start.

232
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,119
Having a rough time of it?

233
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:42,704
Nothing's killed me yet.

234
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,457
- Your arse killed the sledge.
- You offered me a ride.

235
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,460
I just wanted you to shut up
about your damn blisters.

236
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,519
I was born in a place like this.

237
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,522
Later, I fell on hard times.

238
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,025
Are those girls?

239
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,860
Craster's daughters.

240
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:17,572
I haven't seen a girl in six months.

241
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,741
I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.

242
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,911
What, he don't like people
messing with his daughters?

243
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,580
He don't like people messing with his wives.

244
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:31,419
He marries his daughters,
and they give him more daughters.

245
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,588
And on and on it goes.

246
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,550
- That's foul.
- It's beyond foul.

247
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:40,470
All the other wildlings
for a hundred leagues have disappeared.

248
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:42,514
Craster's still here.

249
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,016
He must be doing something right.

250
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,520
What happens to the boys?

251
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,729
Hmm?

252
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,523
He marries his daughters.

253
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:54,484
What does he do with his sons?

254
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,074
He said he planned to stop here
on his way to the Frostfangs.

255
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,742
People make all sorts of plans.

256
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:06,204
I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years.

257
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,706
Haven't missed him.

258
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,375
Always treated me like scum.

259
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,462
Haven't had any good wine for a long time.

260
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,382
You Southerners make good wine,
I'll give you that.

261
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,384
We're not Southerners.

262
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,094
Who's this little girl?

263
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,432
You're prettier than half my daughters.

264
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:28,810
You got a nice wet twat between your legs?

265
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,645
What's your name?

266
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,647
- Jon Snow.
- Snow, eh?

267
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:35,650
Listen to me, bastard.

268
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:39,696
All you lot from south of the Wall,
you're Southerners.

269
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,450
But now you're in the North, the real North.

270
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:44,993
The lad meant no harm.

271
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:50,081
I catch that pretty little bastard
talking to my daughters...

272
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:54,044
No one will talk to your daughters,
you have my word.

273
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:57,172
Now, sit down and shut your mouth.

274
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,427
You bring any of that good wine with you?

275
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,095
We did.

276
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,806
We passed through
six villages on the way here.

277
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,767
All six were abandoned.

278
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,728
Where have all the wildlings gone?

279
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,190
I could tell you, but I'm thirsty.

280
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,651
There's a barrel of Dornish wine
on the sledge.

281
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:20,320
- Bring it in here.
- Yes, Commander.

282
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,490
You want to know
where they've all gone?

283
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:27,577
North, to join up with Mance Rayder.

284
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,705
Your old friend.

285
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:33,333
He's no friend of mine.

286
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:37,796
- He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers.
- Aye.

287
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,966
But once he was just a poor black crow.

288
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,885
And now he's King-beyond-the-Wall.

289
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,388
He's been calling himself that for years.

290
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:50,058
What's he king of? A frozen lake somewhere?

291
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,603
That's a good-looking ax.

292
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,647
Fresh forged?

293
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,234
Give it here.

294
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,529
You'll have another one made at Castle Black.

295
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,572
Here.

296
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:08,118
That's some lovely steel.

297
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:15,000
You want to know
what Mance Rayder is doing?

298
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,418
Gathering an army.

299
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,839
What I hear, he's already got more men
than any of your Southern Kings.

300
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:24,175
And where does he plan marching this army?

301
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,220
When you're all the way north,
there's only one direction to go.

302
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:33,810
These are bad times to be
living alone in the wild.

303
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,312
The cold winds are rising.

304
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:41,026
Let them come. My roots are sunk deep.

305
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,571
Wife,

306
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:48,616
tell the Lord Crow how content we are.

307
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,036
This is our place.

308
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,912
Our husband keeps us safe.

309
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:55,999
Better to live free than die a slave.

310
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,504
Don't it make
you jealous, old man,

311
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:06,885
to see me with all these young wives
and you with no one to warm your bed?

312
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:09,012
We chose different paths.

313
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:13,266
Aye, and you chose the path
with no one but boys on it.

314
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:18,271
You'll be wanting to sleep
beneath my roof, I suppose,

315
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,440
and eat me out of pigs.

316
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,400
A roof would be welcome.

317
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:23,902
It's been hard riding.

318
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:27,197
We've brought our own food
and good steel for you.

319
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,535
Any man lays a hand on one of my wives,

320
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,246
he loses the hand.

321
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:41,211
And I see this one staring too long,

322
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:44,297
I might just gouge his eyes out.

323
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:47,717
Your roof, your rules.

324
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,398
Who am I?

325
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:06,611
- Who am I?
- Lord Commander.

326
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,781
- And who are you?
- Jon Snow.

327
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,241
Who are you?

328
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,202
Your steward.

329
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,704
You want to lead one day?

330
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,960
Then learn how to follow.

331
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,231
Lord of Light,
come to us in our darkness.

332
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:47,360
We offer you these false gods.

333
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:51,114
Take them and cast your light upon us,

334
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:56,244
for the night is dark and full of terrors.

335
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:00,248
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

336
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,544
After the long summer,

337
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,505
darkness will fall heavy on the world.

338
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,175
The stars will bleed.

339
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,844
We need to stop her.

340
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:16,681
The cold breath of winter
will freeze the seas...

341
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:20,935
Not now.
...and the dead shall rise in the North.

342
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:26,274
All you men were named
in the light of the Seven!

343
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,402
Is this how you treat the gods of your fathers?

344
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:34,073
Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors?

345
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,084
You smell of fear,

346
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:49,130
fear and piss and old bones.

347
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,217
Do you want to stop me?

348
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,598
Stop me.

349
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:13,279
In the ancient books, it's written

350
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:17,075
that a warrior will draw
a burning sword from the fire.

351
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:21,412
And that sword shall be Lightbringer.

352
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:29,796
Stannis Baratheon,

353
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,382
Warrior of Light,

354
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,217
your sword awaits you.

355
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,959
Lord, cast your light upon us!

356
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,839
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

357
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:19,095
For the night is dark and full of terror.

358
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:50,001
This woman will lead him
into a war he cannot win.

359
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,669
Stannis is our king.

360
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:53,171
We follow where he leads,

361
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,757
- even if we don't like the path.
- King.

362
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:59,927
Since that boar killed his brother,
every lord wants a coronation.

363
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,180
I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.

364
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:03,890
As do I,

365
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:07,602
but loyal service means telling hard truths.

366
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,689
He's surrounded by fools and fanatics,

367
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:15,818
but he trusts you, Davos.

368
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:18,488
If you tell him the truth...

369
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:21,949
What's the truth?

370
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:38,174
"And I declare upon the honor of
my house that my beloved brother Robert..."

371
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,802
He wasn't my beloved brother.

372
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,970
I didn't love him. He didn't love me.

373
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,889
A harmless courtesy, Your Grace.

374
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,015
A lie. Take it out.

375
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,104
"That my brother Robert
left no trueborn heirs,

376
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:55,775
"the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen,
and the girl Myrcella being born of incest

377
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,903
"between Cersei Lannister
and her brother Jaime Lannister.

378
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,739
- "By right of birth..."
- Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

379
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,157
Call him what he is.

380
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:07,662
"And her brother Jaime Lannister,
the Kingslayer."

381
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:11,040
"By right of birth and blood,
I do this day lay claim..."

382
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:14,001
Make it Ser Jaime Lannister,
the Kingslayer.

383
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,129
Whatever else he is, the man's still a knight.

384
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,548
"Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

385
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,842
"By right of birth and blood,

386
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:23,970
"I do this day lay claim
to the Iron Throne of Westeros.

387
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,681
"Let all true men declare their loyalty."

388
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,058
When Eddard Stark learned
the truth, he told only me.

389
00:29:29,143 --> 00:29:31,352
I'll not make the same mistake.

390
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:33,438
Send copies of that letter
to every corner of the realm,

391
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,440
from the Arbor to the Wall.

392
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,692
The time has come to choose.

393
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,862
Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse.

394
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,448
Your Grace, the Lannisters are
the true enemy.

395
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,616
If, for the time being,
you could make peace with your brother...

396
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,785
I'll not make peace
with Renly while he calls himself king.

397
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,662
Well, many have already declared for him,

398
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,956
Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly.

399
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,251
Stannis does not need
to beg this lord or that lord for support.

400
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,836
The Lord of Light stands behind him.

401
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,173
And how many ships
has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?

402
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:02,717
- He has no need for ships.
- I'm sure he doesn't,

403
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,343
but we do if we're going to war.

404
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:07,472
If not Renly, Your Grace,
join forces with Robb Stark.

405
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,640
Who would steal
the northern half of my kingdom.

406
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:13,144
I've always served thieves according
to their deserts, as you well know, Ser Davos.

407
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:16,272
Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves.

408
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,774
They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them.

409
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,570
I owe you an apology, my king.

410
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:25,364
My duty is to serve.

411
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:29,577
You have chosen the new god
over the old gods.

412
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:33,039
May the Lord of Light watch over us all.

413
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:35,458
Shall we drink together?

414
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,001
Don't.

415
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:42,089
A cup of wine to honor the one true god.

416
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,639
The night is dark and full of terrors, old man,

417
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,809
but the fire burns them all away.

418
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,846
King in the North.

419
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,311
I keep expecting you to leave me
in one castle or another for safekeeping,

420
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:21,272
but you drag me along from camp to camp.

421
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,109
Have you grown fond of me, Stark?

422
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,986
Is that it?

423
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,863
I've never seen you with a girl.

424
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,450
If I left you with one of my bannermen,

425
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:35,536
your father would know within a fortnight

426
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:39,165
and my bannerman would receive
a raven with a message,

427
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:42,793
"Release my son
and you'll be rich beyond your dreams.

428
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:46,297
"Refuse and your house
will be destroyed, root and stem."

429
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:50,885
You don't trust the loyalty
of the men following you into battle?

430
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,012
Oh, I trust them with my life,

431
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:55,556
just not with yours.

432
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,142
Smart boy.

433
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,144
What's wrong?

434
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,812
Don't like being called "boy"?

435
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:04,732
Insulted?

436
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:14,742
You insult yourself, Kingslayer.

437
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,996
You've been defeated by a boy.

438
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:22,208
You're held captive by a boy.

439
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,921
Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy.

440
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,556
Stannis Baratheon sent ravens
to all the high lords of Westeros.

441
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:42,687
King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king

442
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:45,398
nor a true Baratheon.

443
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,692
He's your bastard son.

444
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,111
If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king.

445
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,238
How convenient for him.

446
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:56,575
My father learned the truth.

447
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,285
That's why you had him executed.

448
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,621
I was your prisoner
when Ned Stark lost his head.

449
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:04,375
Your son killed him
so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him.

450
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,710
And you,

451
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,089
you pushed my brother from a window
because he saw you with the queen.

452
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:17,304
You have proof?

453
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,058
Or do you want to trade gossip
like a couple of fishwives?

454
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:25,020
I'm sending one of your cousins down to
King's Landing with my peace terms.

455
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:27,523
You think my father's going
to negotiate with you?

456
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:30,443
You don't know him very well.

457
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:34,113
No, but he's starting to know me.

458
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:38,451
Three victories don't make you a conqueror.

459
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,495
It's better than three defeats.

460
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,818
This city stinks.

461
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,656
Like dead bodies.

462
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,825
A bit corpsey, yes.

463
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,369
And shit.

464
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,038
I thought you wanted to come here.

465
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,084
I love it.

466
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:33,047
You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?

467
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:36,675
And cum and garlic and rum.

468
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,261
You can smell cum from the balcony?

469
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:43,307
I love the stink. I love the noise.

470
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,392
Cities make me want to fuck.

471
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,562
And so did the country.

472
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,317
This is where I belong.

473
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,195
Yes, well, you need to be careful.

474
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,822
No one can know you're here.

475
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,490
No one will know.

476
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,283
You can't trust anyone in King's Landing.

477
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:04,328
They're all liars, good liars, bad liars,

478
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,831
one or two great liars.

479
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,791
What about you?

480
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,627
Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.

481
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,380
Truth?

482
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:19,343
You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.

483
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,387
Why do you think I am so little?

484
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:25,766
I'm being crushed beneath
the weight of all that truth.

485
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,982
Ned Stark actually slept on this.

486
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:36,694
As if the poor man didn't suffer enough.

487
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:42,116
One of the many changes
we'll have to make around here.

488
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:55,212
Lord Baelish.

489
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:56,547
Your Grace.

490
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,091
I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.

491
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,718
Of course, Your Grace.

492
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,720
Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya,

493
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:04,972
we can't seem to locate her.

494
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,602
If she's escaped the capital,
Winterfell seems the logical destination.

495
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,104
And yet my friends in the North
report no sign of her.

496
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,064
Curious.

497
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,233
If we choose to negotiate with the Starks,

498
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:18,319
the girl has some value. Whoever finds her...

499
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,654
Well, you know what they say
about Lannisters and debts.

500
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,115
Well, you could ask Varys where she is.

501
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,451
He'll have an answer for you.

502
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:26,952
Whether you believe it...

503
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:31,040
Myself, I have always had
a hard time trusting eunuchs.

504
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:33,584
Who knows what they want?

505
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,586
A mockingbird.

506
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,673
- You created your own sigil, didn't you?
- Yes.

507
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:44,428
Appropriate, for a self-made man
with so many songs to sing.

508
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,096
I'm glad you like it.

509
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:49,642
Some people are fortunate enough
to be born into the right family.

510
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:52,186
Others have to find their own way.

511
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,773
I heard a song once

512
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:58,442
about a boy of modest means

513
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,028
who found his way into the home
of a very prominent family.

514
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:03,989
He loved the eldest daughter.

515
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:06,408
Sadly, she had eyes for another.

516
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:11,747
When boys and girls live in the same home,
awkward situations can arise.

517
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:17,127
Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers
and sisters develop certain affections.

518
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,214
And when those affections
become common knowledge,

519
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:24,134
well, that is an awkward situation indeed,

520
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,345
especially in a prominent family.

521
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,722
But prominent families
often forget a simple truth,

522
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,183
I've found.

523
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,269
And which truth is that?

524
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,689
Knowledge is power.

525
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:42,486
Seize him.

526
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,240
Cut his throat.

527
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:49,076
Stop. Wait.

528
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,246
I've changed my mind. Let him go.

529
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,917
Step back three paces.

530
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,129
Turn around.

531
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:02,339
Close your eyes.

532
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,262
Power is power.

533
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:14,685
Do see if you can take some time away
from your coins and your whores

534
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,603
to locate the Stark girl for me.

535
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,356
I would very much appreciate it.

536
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,119
You're Ser Alton Lannister?

537
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,788
I am, Your Grace.

538
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:38,250
I offer your cousins peace
if they meet my terms.

539
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:42,629
First, your family must release my sisters.

540
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:46,258
Second, my father's bones
must be returned to us

541
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:51,055
so he may rest beside his brother and sister
in the crypts beneath Winterfell.

542
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:55,142
And the remains of all those who died
in his service must also be returned.

543
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,103
Their families can honor them
with proper funerals.

544
00:39:58,188 --> 00:40:00,981
- An honorable request, Your Grace.
- Third...

545
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:07,321
Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce
all claim to dominion of the North.

546
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:12,659
From this time till the end of time,
we are a free and independent kingdom.

547
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,745
The King in the North.

548
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,247
- King in the North.
- King in the North.

549
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:21,043
Neither Joffrey nor any of his men
shall set foot in our lands again.

550
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,128
If he disregards this command,

551
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:26,090
he shall suffer the same fate as my father,

552
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:30,928
only I don't need a servant
to do my beheading for me.

553
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:34,389
These are... Your Grace, these are...

554
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:36,975
These are my terms.

555
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,145
If the Queen Regent and her son meet them,
I'll give them peace.

556
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,522
If not,

557
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:45,776
I will litter the South with Lannister dead.

558
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,570
King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace.

559
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,197
Oh, is he?

560
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:54,159
You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton.

561
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,454
That will be all for tonight.

562
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,429
A word, Your Grace?

563
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,976
You don't have to call me "Your Grace"
when no one's around.

564
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,687
It's not so bad once you get used to it.

565
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,730
I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.

566
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,900
The Lannisters are going
to reject your terms, you know?

567
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,819
Of course they are.

568
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,196
We can fight them
in the fields as long as you like,

569
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:34,575
but we won't beat them
until you take King's Landing.

570
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:39,621
And we can't take King's Landing
without ships.

571
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:42,166
My father has ships
and men who know how to sail them.

572
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,001
Men who fought my father.

573
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:46,336
Men who fought King Robert
to free themselves

574
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:50,090
from the yoke of the South,
just like you're doing now.

575
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,427
I'm his only living son.

576
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:57,556
He'll listen to me. I know he will.

577
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:02,769
I'm not a Stark. I know that.

578
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:06,273
But your father raised me
to be an honorable man.

579
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:10,611
We can avenge him together.

580
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:14,907
You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.

581
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:17,284
I need his ships. They say he has 200.

582
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:21,246
They say a million rats
live in the sewers of King's Landing.

583
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:22,831
Shall we rally them to fight for us?

584
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:24,791
I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.

585
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:28,670
I don't trust Lord Greyjoy
because he is not trustworthy.

586
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,049
Your father had to go to war
to end his rebellion.

587
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:35,886
Yes. And now I'm the one
rebelling against the throne.

588
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,222
Before me, it was Father.

589
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:39,973
You married one rebel and mothered another.

590
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:42,976
I mothered more than just rebels,

591
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,270
a fact you seem to have forgotten.

592
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:49,608
If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls,
my bannermen will string me up by my feet.

593
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:52,903
You want to leave Sansa
in the queen's hands?

594
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,988
And Arya...

595
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:59,826
I haven't heard a word about Arya.
What are we fighting for, if not for them?

596
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:03,455
It's more complicated than that!
You know it is.

597
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,514
It's time for me to go home.

598
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:24,518
I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.

599
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,813
You can't go to Winterfell.

600
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,148
I beg your pardon?

601
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:33,610
I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys

602
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:38,073
because tomorrow
you'll ride south to the Stormlands.

603
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,158
Why in the name of all the gods...

604
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:44,037
Because I need you
to negotiate with Renly Baratheon.

605
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,206
He's rallied an army of 100,000.

606
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,041
You know him. You know his family.

607
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,502
I haven't seen Renly Baratheon
since he was a boy.

608
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:51,878
You have a hundred other lords...

609
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:54,965
Which of these lords
do I trust more than you?

610
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,677
If Renly sides with us,

611
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:01,263
we'll outnumber them two to one.

612
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:04,141
When they feel the jaws beginning to shut,
they'll sue for peace.

613
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:06,893
We'll get the girls back.

614
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:09,896
Then we'll all go home, for good.

615
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,282
I will ride at first light.

616
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,294
We will all be together again soon, I promise.

617
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,302
You've done so well.

618
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:44,514
Your father would be proud.

619
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:56,360
- Give Lord Renly my regards.
- King Renly.

620
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,155
There's a king in every corner now.

621
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,045
What is all this?

622
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,215
Returning this room to its proper appearance.

623
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:21,176
Say what you will about the Targaryens,
they were conquerors.

624
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,887
That is a seat for a conqueror.

625
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:27,557
It needs a room to match it,
not vines and flowers.

626
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:30,060
We can't find Arya Stark.

627
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,145
With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere.

628
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,272
Perhaps. But if not, we need her.

629
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:36,608
They'll never give Jaime back
to us for Sansa alone.

630
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,194
I think they might. They're weak.

631
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,196
They put too much value on their women.

632
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:44,908
We need to set our armies
to the task of finding her.

633
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,952
Send out as many men as we can.

634
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:48,912
I'm sure if you asked Grandfather...

635
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,748
The king does not ask, he commands.

636
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:55,627
And my grandfather's stupidity
in the field of battle

637
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,547
is the reason Robb Stark
has Uncle Jaime in the first place.

638
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:00,507
His life is in danger.

639
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:03,051
We're at war.

640
00:46:03,136 --> 00:46:05,262
All our lives are in danger.

641
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:11,935
I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime.

642
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,020
And you.

643
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:19,025
Our enemies will say anything
to weaken your claim to the throne.

644
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,986
It's not a claim. The throne is mine.

645
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,364
Of course it is.

646
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,452
No one believes this foul gossip.

647
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:30,537
Someone believes it.

648
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:34,124
Father had other children?

649
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,960
Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?

650
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,922
What are you asking?

651
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:44,259
I'm asking if he fucked other women
when he grew tired of you.

652
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,678
How many bastards does he have running...

653
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:06,740
What you just did is punishable by death.

654
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,329
You will never do it again.

655
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:14,664
Never.

656
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,797
That will be all, Mother.

657
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,640
No, no, no, no.

658
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:34,518
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

659
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,019
Ease into it.

660
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:39,105
Slowly, with passion.

661
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:42,776
Oh, yeah.

662
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:46,780
Go wash yourselves. Put some clothes on.

663
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,366
Both of you are working tonight.

664
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,205
We do things differently here, Daisy.

665
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:59,167
This isn't some five-copper
bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.

666
00:47:59,252 --> 00:48:01,836
- Haystack Hall.
- Wherever you're from.

667
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:06,383
Our establishment doesn't cater
to plowmen and goat herders.

668
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:08,218
Lord Olsen.

669
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,220
Taste is everything here.

670
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,222
Littlefinger's a fancy man.

671
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,932
Don't call him Littlefinger.

672
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,433
He doesn't like it.

673
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:17,852
Lord Baelish.

674
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:25,694
She pretends she doesn't
speak the common tongue

675
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:28,363
so that people will think she's exotic.

676
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:31,241
She grew up just down the road
in Flea Bottom.

677
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,785
She's beautiful.

678
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:37,163
She's a dumb slut, really,
but a lid for every pot.

679
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:44,546
Lord Commander.

680
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,465
Good to see you again.

681
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:06,526
You do realize this establishment
is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish,

682
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:08,778
the King's Master of Coin.

683
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,697
Coin which goes in many pockets.

684
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,408
- Orders.
- Whose orders?

685
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:16,244
Someone who doesn't care
what Littlefinger thinks.

686
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:37,140
No, you can't. No! Please!

687
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:40,352
No! Not my Barra!

688
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:43,855
- Please. Please.
- Enough. Get it done.

689
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,815
- Kill the bastard.
- No, no!

690
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,318
- Please.
- Give it here.

691
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,570
No, please.

692
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,249
Spread out. Search every house.

693
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,585
Every room. Look in every room.

694
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,696
Gendry! His name is Gendry.

695
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,531
Where is the bastard?

696
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:37,200
The Night's Watch! Please, stop!

697
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,702
Where?

698
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,705
They took him up the Kingsroad,
heading north.

699
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:45,375
- How will we know him?
- He's got a bull's head helmet.

700
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,294
- He made it himself.
- Find him.

1
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,924
Gotta be ready before nightfall.

2
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:15,802
Now keep it moving.

3
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,393
Put a watch on the ridge
and the tree lines.

4
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,772
Boy.

5
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:30,358
Lovely boy.

6
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,652
What do you want?

7
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,320
A man has a thirst.

8
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,406
A man does not drink for a day and a night.

9
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:39,408
A boy could make a friend.

10
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,035
I have friends.

11
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,038
Give us beer before I skin you.

12
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,250
A man does not choose his companions.

13
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,293
These two, they have no courtesy.

14
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,420
A man must ask forgiveness.

15
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,342
You're called Arry?

16
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,597
This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar,

17
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,349
once of the Free City of Lorath...

18
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,644
Beer, you little shit. Get us beer!

19
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,522
You should have asked nicely.

20
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,606
Aah!

21
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:15,945
Come closer...

22
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,656
and I'll shove that stick up your bunghole

23
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,575
and fuck you bloody.

24
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:23,119
That boy has more courage than sense.

25
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,287
Come here!

26
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,955
Yoren said none of us were
to go near those three.

27
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,206
Come here!

28
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,499
They don't scare me.

29
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,626
Hmm? Then you're stupid.

30
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,545
They scare me.

31
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,760
What are gold cloaks
doing so far from King's Landing?

32
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,058
What are you doing?

33
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,476
They're looking for me.

34
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:49,687
You in command here?

35
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,190
You're a long way from home.

36
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,276
I asked you a question.

37
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,986
Aye, you did.

38
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,281
You asked without manners

39
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,742
and I chose not to answer.

40
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,535
I have a royal warrant

41
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:09,040
for one of these gutter rats
you're transporting.

42
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,211
Well, the thing is...

43
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:18,341
these gutter rats belong
to the Night's Watch now.

44
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:21,552
That puts them beyond the reach
of kings and queens.

45
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:23,179
Does it?

46
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,556
It's a funny thing,

47
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,683
people worry so much about their throats

48
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,186
that they forget about what's down low.

49
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,899
Now, I sharpened this blade before breakfast.

50
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,986
I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to.

51
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:43,616
Or... I could nick this artery in your leg.

52
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,701
And once it's nicked,

53
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,829
there's no one around here
who knows how to un-nick it.

54
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,041
We'll just keep that.

55
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,337
Good steel is always needed on the Wall.

56
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,131
Seems you have a choice,

57
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:03,469
you can die here at this crossroads
a long way from home,

58
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,263
or you can go back to your city
and tell your masters

59
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,766
you didn't find what you were looking for.

60
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,024
We're looking for a boy named Gendry.

61
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,402
He carries a bull's head helmet.

62
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:24,740
Anyone turning him over
will earn the King's reward.

63
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,410
We'll be back with more men

64
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,871
and I'll be taking your head home
along with that bastard boy.

65
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,075
My lord.

66
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,827
You make me wait a long time,

67
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,829
but your friend keeps me company.

68
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,832
We were just speaking of your bravery

69
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,626
in the victory against
the Stark auxiliary forces.

70
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,296
It was quite a battle.

71
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,675
I heard you suffered a terrible head wound.

72
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:28,304
The northerners are such fearsome warriors.

73
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,098
And I tell him the story of how we meet.

74
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,853
To find so lovely a creature
working in your father's kitchens...

75
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,272
it almost beggars belief.

76
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,816
Strange things do happen.

77
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,861
You should taste her fish pie.

78
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,447
I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.

79
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,658
- How can you tell?
- I can always tell.

80
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,788
Men like Lord Varys and I can't let
our disadvantages get the best of us.

81
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,748
We'll make a fisherman of him yet.

82
00:06:56,792 --> 00:07:01,003
I am glad your new friend
was able to accompany you to the capital.

83
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,882
Friends are such an important part of life.

84
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,594
Unfortunate that your father
didn't want her to come.

85
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,097
But rest easy, my lord.

86
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:15,518
I am very good at keeping secrets
for my good friends.

87
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,104
Your discretion is legendary...

88
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,189
Where your friends are concerned.

89
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:24,860
How unspeakable of me to go on and on
when all you want to do is rest.

90
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,070
I will leave you.

91
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,783
Welcome to King's Landing, my dear.

92
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,744
This city is made brighter by your presence.

93
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,955
We have a council meeting, my lord.

94
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,794
I don't like threats.

95
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,295
Who threatened you?

96
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,340
I'm not Ned Stark.
I understand the way this game is played.

97
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,092
Ned Stark was a man of honor.

98
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,385
And I am not.

99
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,471
Threaten me again
and I'll have you thrown into the sea.

100
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,602
You might be disappointed in the results.

101
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,355
Storms come and go,

102
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,691
the big fish eat the little fish,

103
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,443
and I keep on paddling.

104
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,238
Come, my lord.

105
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,283
We shouldn't keep the queen waiting.

106
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,582
"From this time until the end of time,

107
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,417
"we are not part of your realm,

108
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,712
"but a free and independent
Kingdom of the North."

109
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,468
He has more spirit than his father,
I'll give him that.

110
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:34,305
You've perfected the art of tearing up papers.

111
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,349
We can give him his father's bones back,
at least,

112
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,185
as a gesture of good faith.

113
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,353
You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?

114
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,856
I will, Your Grace.

115
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,985
Did you see my brother
when you were the Starks' guest?

116
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,361
I did.

117
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,739
They have not broken his spirit, Your Grace.

118
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,992
If you speak with him,

119
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,953
tell him he's not been forgotten.

120
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,956
- I will, Your Grace.
- Safe travels, cousin.

121
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,796
You have a deft hand with diplomacy.

122
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,590
If that's everything...

123
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:14,053
A raven flew in this morning
from Castle Black.

124
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,347
Trouble with the wildlings.

125
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,933
That's why they're called "wildlings."

126
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,310
Somewhat less wild these days.

127
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,938
Seems they've stopped killing each other

128
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,732
and started following
this king-beyond-the-Wall.

129
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,235
Another king? How many is that now?

130
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,403
Five? I've lost count.

131
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:35,074
The Lord Commander asks
that we send more men to man the Wall.

132
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:38,619
Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war.
We have no men to spare.

133
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,915
"The cold winds are rising
and the dead rise with them."

134
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,669
The northerners are a superstitious people.

135
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,837
According to the Commander,

136
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,090
one of these dead men
attacked him in his chambers.

137
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,675
Mormont doesn't lie.

138
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,761
How do you kill a dead man?

139
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:58,514
Apparently you burn him.

140
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:04,937
One trip to the Wall and you come back
believing in grumpkins and snarks.

141
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,690
I don't know what I believe,

142
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,567
but here's a fact for you:

143
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,486
the Night's Watch is the only thing

144
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,155
that separates us from
what lies beyond the Wall.

145
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,702
I have every confidence that the brave men
of the Night's Watch will protect us all.

146
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:25,124
And I said,
"if the gods wanted us to have dignity,

147
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,501
"they wouldn't make us fart when we died."

148
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,255
We fart when we die?

149
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,757
My blessed mother,

150
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,385
I was holding her hand
when she left this world.

151
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,222
She farted so hard, the whole bed shook.

152
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,609
Seems a bit greedy for one man
to have so many wives.

153
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,112
Wouldn't two or three be enough for him?

154
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,364
We were having a serious discussion.

155
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,993
Would you look at that?

156
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,247
Nothing like the sight
of a woman walking away.

157
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,875
I prefer watching them come towards me.

158
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,294
I'm sure that's nice, too.

159
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:15,966
Yeah, well, there was a milkmaid named Violet
on the next farm over from where I grew up.

160
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:19,094
We were wrestling together
from the time we were six years old.

161
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,058
And then we got older and the wrestling...

162
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,061
changed.

163
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:28,771
You were with her?

164
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,148
How many times?

165
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,609
Well, as many times as I could.

166
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,114
I wish I grew up on a farm.

167
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:43,327
We need more potatoes.
Get another sack from the sledge.

168
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,041
Get the turnips, too.

169
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,389
No. Ghost, no.

170
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,182
No!

171
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,644
Ghost, away. Shoo. Shoo!

172
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:14,817
You all right?

173
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,028
- Did he frighten you?
- You shouldn't touch me.

174
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,780
Oh.

175
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,615
Oh, right.

176
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,242
I'm sorry.

177
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:26,203
I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt.

178
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,545
You're very brave.

179
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,515
What are you doing?

180
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,475
This is Gilly.

181
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,602
She's one of Craster's daughters.

182
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,397
Hello, Gilly. What are you doing?

183
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,898
Sam said you could help.

184
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,608
I'm sorry, but Sam knows
we're not supposed...

185
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,068
She's pregnant.

186
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,619
We have to take her with us when we leave.

187
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,455
What?

188
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,457
- What would that...
- I know it sounds a bit mad.

189
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,125
No, it doesn't sound a bit mad,
it's impossible.

190
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,128
- The Lord Commander ordered us to...
- We are sworn to protect.

191
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,005
- Sam, we can't take...
- Please, sir, please.

192
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,965
I can still run if I have to.

193
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,384
- It's just not possible.
- I'm going to have a baby.

194
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,552
If it's a boy...

195
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,805
if it's a boy, what?

196
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:36,356
You want us to risk our lives for you
and you won't even tell us why?

197
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:45,157
- Why'd you do that?
- Do what? Ask her a question?

198
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,034
- You were cruel.
- Cruel?

199
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,036
Sam, are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?

200
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,330
- I didn't touch her.
- No, you just want to steal her.

201
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,040
What do you think Craster cuts off for that?

202
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:57,294
I can't steal her. She's a person, not a goat.

203
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,844
We're heading
deeper and deeper into wildling territory.

204
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:08,639
We can't take a girl with us.
Mormont wouldn't have it.

205
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:11,600
And even if he would,
what would we do with her?

206
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,477
Who's going to deliver a baby, you?

207
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:15,729
I could try.

208
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,732
What? I've read about it.

209
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,360
A bit.

210
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,780
I'm sorry, Sam.

211
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,324
We can't help her.

212
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,465
Khaleesi.

213
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,847
- You don't need to see this.
- He is blood of my blood.

214
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,354
- Who did this?
- Khal Pono, perhaps.

215
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,689
Khal Jhaqo.

216
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:25,942
They don't like the idea of a woman
leading a khalasar.

217
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,987
They will like it far less
when I am done with them.

218
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,876
They killed his soul!

219
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,130
Shh. They cannot kill his soul.

220
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,132
They did!

221
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,593
They butchered him like an animal.

222
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,430
They did not burn his body.

223
00:16:55,723 --> 00:17:00,435
He can neverjoin his ancestors
in the night lands.

224
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,606
Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre.

225
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,989
And I promise you,

226
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,992
Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight.

227
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,248
Is it as you remember, my lord?

228
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,417
It looks smaller.

229
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,335
Everything looks bigger when you're a child.

230
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,256
I remember my father's cabin
felt like a palace when I was little.

231
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,593
Now look at it.

232
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,928
They'll be waiting for me on the docks.

233
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,680
Who will?

234
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,599
Anyone who matters.

235
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,726
This is a big day for them.

236
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,271
They haven't had much to get
excited about since I left.

237
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,440
It's a hard place, the lron islands.

238
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,983
Always has been.

239
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,277
It's cold and it's wet.

240
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,029
Oh, I love the cold and wet.

241
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,531
They say hard places breed hard men.

242
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,285
And hard men rule the world.

243
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,332
Then you'll be king before long.

244
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,462
Try smiling with your lips closed.

245
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:52,714
Better.

246
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,637
My father doesn't trust you lron islanders.

247
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,639
I don't blame him.

248
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,725
He says that you're all reavers and rapers

249
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,644
and that no matter
how many women you have,

250
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,813
you'll never be sat...

251
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,856
Quit talking about your father.

252
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,151
But he's right about us.

253
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,572
Our wives from the lron islands,
they're for breeding.

254
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,866
That's not enough for us.

255
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:23,995
That's why we take salt wives,
the women we capture.

256
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,497
Capture me.

257
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,666
Take me with you when you go ashore.

258
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,837
- Make me your salt wife.
- Your place is on this ship.

259
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,964
Not after you leave.

260
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:37,843
Father will punish me. He'll call me a whore.

261
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,429
I haven't paid you.

262
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,026
Oh, yeah.

263
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,206
I paid good money...

264
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,093
I'm not going to stand for this.

265
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,887
I barely touched her.

266
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:24,472
Now, you charge twice as much
as every other brothel

267
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:25,932
and this is what I get, crying.

268
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:28,351
One moment, my friend. A moment.

269
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,988
Please accept my sincerest apologies.

270
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,490
Aremca will take good care of you.

271
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,105
I'm sorry, my lord.

272
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,486
Did he hurt you?

273
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,530
No, my lord.

274
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,576
It's Mhaegen.

275
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,203
Who?

276
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,706
She works for you.

277
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,376
She's the one...

278
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,795
The gold cloaks,

279
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,547
- they killed her baby.
- Ah, yes.

280
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:40,966
That was...

281
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,301
poorly handled.

282
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:49,224
Sometimes those with the most power
have the least grace.

283
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,228
I can't stop thinking about it.

284
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:55,730
I can't sleep.

285
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,567
Her poor little baby.

286
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,904
You know, you remind me of another girl,

287
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,742
a lovely thing I once acquired
from a Lysene pleasure house.

288
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,871
Beautiful, like yourself,

289
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:15,333
and intelligent, like yourself.

290
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,836
But she wasn't happy.

291
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,132
She cried often.

292
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,467
I asked her why,

293
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,514
but we didn't have the kind of rapport
that you and I have.

294
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,103
Yes, it was quite sad.

295
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,608
Girls from the Lysene pleasure houses
are expensive,

296
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,277
extremely expensive.

297
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,697
And this one wasn't making me any money.

298
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,495
I hate bad investments.

299
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,873
Really, I do.

300
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,126
They haunt me.

301
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,257
I had no idea how to make her happy,

302
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:08,261
no idea how to mitigate my losses.

303
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:14,059
A very wealthy patron,
he offered me a tremendous amount of money

304
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,977
to let him transform

305
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:19,147
this lovely, sad girl.

306
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,649
To use her in ways

307
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,861
that would never occur to most men.

308
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,074
But you know what occurs to most men.

309
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,164
I would not say he succeeded
in making her happy,

310
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:41,836
but my losses were definitely mitigated.

311
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,680
Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen's child.

312
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:55,809
I'll see you tomorrow.

313
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,186
And you'll be happy?

314
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,858
That makes me happy.

315
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:17,872
More wine?

316
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,126
- Damn it, boy!
- Apologies, my lord.

317
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,420
Leave us, Podrick.
I believe we know how to pour our own wine.

318
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,632
That's your new squire?

319
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,676
I could've found you a proper lad.

320
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,762
Myself, I prefer the improper ones.

321
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,431
That's a good red. Dornish?

322
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:36,933
You know your wines, my lord.

323
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,560
That I do.

324
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:41,187
A fine dinner, my lord.

325
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:42,897
Call me Tyrion, please.

326
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:46,776
I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners,
now that you're a lord.

327
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:48,695
Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.

328
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:51,322
Wars have been started for less.

329
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,451
I heard there was some trouble
in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.

330
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:56,578
Mmm.

331
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,037
Nasty business.

332
00:24:58,122 --> 00:24:59,956
- Had to be done.
- Yes, of course.

333
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,875
The City Watch must keep the peace.

334
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:05,879
Only, I hadn't realized
peace depended on killing babies.

335
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,591
- Orders are orders.
- Quite right.

336
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,759
Especially the Queen's orders.

337
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,553
I never said they were the Queen's orders.

338
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:17,390
No, but who else would want
to murder King Robert's bastards?

339
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:19,767
She's always been a jealous woman.

340
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,519
You know your sister better than I do.

341
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:23,897
You've heard the awful rumors
about my brother and sister?

342
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,607
I don't listen to filth.

343
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:28,484
That's good of you, but you have heard them.

344
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,863
I suppose people who do believe that filth
consider Robert's bastards

345
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,449
to be better claimants to the throne
than Cersei's children.

346
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,492
Joffrey is my king.
The rest doesn't interest me.

347
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:38,620
I appreciate your loyalty.

348
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:44,334
Tell me, when your men
slaughtered Ned Stark's men

349
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:47,337
in the throne room, did you give the order?

350
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:49,797
I did.

351
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,050
And I would again.

352
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:53,927
The man was a traitor.

353
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,887
He tried to buy my loyalty.

354
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,347
The fool.

355
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,225
He had no idea you were already bought.

356
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,060
Are you drunk?

357
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,771
I'll not have my honor questioned by an imp!

358
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:08,149
I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos.

359
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,568
I'm denying its existence.

360
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:13,738
If you think I'll stand here
and take this from you, dwarf...

361
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,616
Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp.

362
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,202
And, yes, you will stand here
and take it from me,

363
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,704
unless you'd like to take it
from my friend here.

364
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,457
I intend to serve as Hand of the King

365
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,084
until my father returns from the war.

366
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,378
And seeing as you betrayed
the last Hand of the King,

367
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:31,256
well, I just wouldn't feel safe
with you lurking about.

368
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:32,882
What are you...

369
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,926
My friends at court will not allow this!

370
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,011
- The Queen herself has granted...
- The Queen Regent.

371
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,639
And you're a fool to believe she is your friend.

372
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,975
We shall hear what Joffrey
has to say about this.

373
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,184
No, we shan't.

374
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:54,112
There's a ship leaving
for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea tonight.

375
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:57,657
From there, I'm afraid,
it's rather a long walk to Castle Black.

376
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,200
I hope you enjoy the Wall.

377
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:02,328
I found it surprisingly beautiful...

378
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:06,291
in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable
sort of way.

379
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,209
The lads will escort you.

380
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:10,461
The streets aren't safe at night, my lord.

381
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,213
These men are under my command!

382
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,924
I command you to arrest this cutthroat.

383
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:16,634
His name is Bronn,

384
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:19,095
and he is the new commander
of the City Watch.

385
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,471
Boys.

386
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:25,226
I have friends at court,

387
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:27,061
powerful friends!

388
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,398
The king himself made me a lord!

389
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:37,447
To the new commander.

390
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:47,540
If I told you to murder an infant girl, say,

391
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,625
still at her mother's breast,

392
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:52,795
would you do it without question?

393
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,425
Without question? No.

394
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,427
I'd ask, "How much?"

395
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,947
if they come back, I say we yield.

396
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,449
Gendry's the one they want.

397
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,284
Don't want to get caught
in the middle of a battle.

398
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,036
I ain't afraid of no battles.

399
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,747
If you got within a mile of a battle,
you'd fill your pants.

400
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,290
I've seen lots of battles.

401
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,042
- I saw...
- Liar.

402
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,252
I saw a man kill another man

403
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:35,755
just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom.

404
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,091
Stabbed him right in the neck.

405
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,468
Two men fighting isn't a battle.

406
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:43,638
- They had armor on.
- So?

407
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:46,349
So, if they've got armor on, it's a battle.

408
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,809
No, it isn't.

409
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,020
What does a dyer's apprentice
know about battles anyway?

410
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:53,147
Gendry's an armorer's apprentice.

411
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:56,150
Hot Pie, tell Gendry
what makes a fight into a battle.

412
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,488
It's when they've got armor on.

413
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,240
Who told you that?

414
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,784
A knight.

415
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,286
How'd you know he was a knight?

416
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:11,874
Well, it was 'cause he'd got armor on.

417
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:14,001
You don't have to be a knight to have armor.

418
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,503
Any idiot can buy armor.

419
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,630
How do you know?

420
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,382
'Cause I sold armor.

421
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,605
What do the gold cloaks want with you?

422
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,607
- No idea.
- You're a liar.

423
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:39,360
You know, you shouldn't
insult people that are bigger than you.

424
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:42,029
Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone.

425
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,115
I don't care what any of them want.

426
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,159
No good's ever come of their questions.

427
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,244
No good's ever come?

428
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,455
Who asked questions before?

429
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:53,666
How can someone so small
be such a huge pain in my arse?

430
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,001
Who asked questions?

431
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,380
The Hand of the King.

432
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:01,674
Hands of the King.

433
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,927
Lord Arryn came first
a few weeks before he died,

434
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:08,556
and then Lord Stark came
a few weeks before he died.

435
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,350
Lord Stark?

436
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:14,896
See? Asking me questions is bad luck.

437
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,733
You'll probably be dead soon.

438
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:22,945
- What did they ask about?
- My mum.

439
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,615
- Who's your mum?
- Just my mum,

440
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:27,617
worked in a tavern, died when I was little.

441
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:29,327
And who was your father?

442
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:32,538
Could've been one of those
gold-hatted bastards, for all I know.

443
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:34,707
What about you anyway?

444
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,918
You thought they were after you.

445
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,837
Why?

446
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:42,757
Did you kill someone
or is it just because you're a girl?

447
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:45,593
- I'm not a girl.
- Yes, you are.

448
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,345
Do you think I'm as stupid
as the rest of them?

449
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:48,471
Stupider.

450
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,473
The Night's Watch doesn't take girls,
everyone knows that.

451
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,017
- Yeah, that's true, but you're still a girl.
- I am not!

452
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,686
Yeah? Well, pull your cock out
and take a piss, then.

453
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,356
I don't need to take a piss.

454
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,781
Lommy and Hot Pie can't know.

455
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,282
No one can know.

456
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:11,953
Well, they won't. Not from me.

457
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:16,457
My name's not Arry.

458
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,044
It's Arya, of House Stark.

459
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:24,298
Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.

460
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,761
He was your father, the Hand, the traitor.

461
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,346
He was never a traitor.

462
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:32,348
Joffrey is a liar.

463
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,226
So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady.

464
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,186
No. I mean, yes.

465
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:38,813
My mother was a lady and my sister...

466
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:42,441
Yeah, but you were a lord's daughter,
and you lived in a castle and you...

467
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:45,236
Look, all that about cocks,
I should never have said...

468
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,863
And I've been pissing
in front of you and everything.

469
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:50,366
I should be calling you "my lady."

470
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,244
- Do not call me "my lady."
- As my lady commands.

471
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,204
Well, that was unladylike.

472
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:56,789
Oh!

473
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:26,277
What's she carrying?

474
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,238
Myrish oranges,

475
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:30,990
wine from the Arbor...

476
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:34,869
and the heir to Pyke and the lron islands.

477
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,292
The only living son of Balon Greyjoy.

478
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:46,047
Me.

479
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,467
I don't like wine.

480
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,510
Woman's drink.

481
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:56,432
I need to get to Pyke.

482
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,194
I'll find you a horse.

483
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,291
I'm heading that way. I can take you there.

484
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,752
I bet you can.

485
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:26,921
Have you been at sea long?

486
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,548
Or were there just no women
where you came from?

487
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,801
- None like you.
- You don't know what I'm like.

488
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,512
Maybe you don't know what you're like.

489
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,722
Maybe you need someone to teach you.

490
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:39,684
Do you know who I am?

491
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:43,062
You think I offer free rides
to every man in jewelry,

492
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,606
Lord Greyjoy?

493
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:50,986
Have my things sent up to the castle.

494
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,588
You should give me the reins.

495
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:11,298
I'm a better rider than you.

496
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,300
I've been on horseback
for the past nine years.

497
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,885
Nine years?

498
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,763
Do you still know your way around a ship?

499
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:19,807
Have these hands ever touched a rope?

500
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,309
Don't you worry about my hands.

501
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,355
The sea is in my blood.

502
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,442
Your blood will be in the sea
if I don't watch where I'm going.

503
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,986
I have a proposal for my father,

504
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:35,406
one that will make him king again,

505
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,116
and me after him.

506
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:42,329
You may get to stay
in a castle tonight if you're lucky.

507
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,540
Is that an offer from my future king?

508
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,751
An order from your future king.

509
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,964
You can tell your grandchildren
about this night.

510
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:55,426
I don't imagine it will be
a story fit for children.

511
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,440
Father.

512
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:12,526
Nine years, is it?

513
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:15,780
They took a frightened boy.

514
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,199
What have they given back?

515
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,160
A man.

516
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,371
- Your blood and your heir.
- We shall see.

517
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,793
Stark had you longer than I did.

518
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:31,587
Lord Stark is gone.

519
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:35,883
And how do you feel about that?

520
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,055
What's done is done.

521
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,141
I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.

522
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:45,726
Who gave you those clothes?

523
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,731
Was it Ned Stark's pleasure
to make you his daughter?

524
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,651
If my clothes offend you, I will change them.

525
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:54,860
You will.

526
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,697
That bauble round your neck,

527
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:01,951
did you pay the iron price for it, or the gold?

528
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:04,829
I asked a question.

529
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:07,456
Did you pull it from the neck
of a corpse you made

530
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:11,794
or did you buy it to match your fine clothes?

531
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:16,423
Iron or gold?

532
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:20,594
Gold.

533
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:28,269
I'll not have my son dressed as a whore.

534
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:33,732
My fears have come true,

535
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:36,110
the Starks have made you theirs.

536
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:39,238
- My blood is salt and iron.
- Yet the Stark boy sends you to me

537
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:42,616
like a trained raven clutching his message.

538
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,535
The offer he makes is one I proposed.

539
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,246
- He heeds your counsel?
- I've lived with him,

540
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,873
hunted with him, fought at his side.

541
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,457
He thinks of me as a brother.

542
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:53,294
No, not here, not in my hearing.

543
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,671
You will not name him brother,

544
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:59,717
this son of the man who put
your true brothers to the sword.

545
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:02,595
Or have you forgotten your own blood?

546
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,597
I forget nothing.

547
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,515
I remember my brothers.

548
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:10,019
And I remember when my father was a king.

549
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:27,828
I see.

550
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:31,248
I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him

551
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:34,627
and he will make me
king of the lron islands once again.

552
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:37,379
- I will lead the attack myself.
- Oh, you will?

553
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,175
I'm your son, your only living heir.

554
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,177
Who else?

555
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,556
I told you to wait outside.

556
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:50,851
How did you get past the guards?

557
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:53,312
Anything with a cock is easy to fool.

558
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,522
My dear.

559
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:00,736
Yara?

560
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:03,197
So good to see you, brother.

561
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:07,618
This is a homecoming
I'll tell my grandchildren about.

562
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,748
- She can't lead an attack!
- And why not?

563
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:14,792
You're a woman!

564
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:18,295
- You're the one in skirts.
- This isn't Winterfell, boy.

565
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,965
Your sister took over command
of your eldest brother's ship

566
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:23,801
after your new father killed him.

567
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,845
- What's dead may never die.
- ...dead may never die.

568
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:31,558
The only nights she's spent off these islands
have been spent on the sea.

569
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:34,603
She's commanded men.

570
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:36,188
She's killed men.

571
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,899
She knows who she is.

572
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,988
No man gives me a crown.

573
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,824
I pay the iron price.

574
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,243
I will take my crown,

575
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:51,954
for that is who I am.

576
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,790
That is who we have always been.

577
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:01,964
You won't stand a chance
against the Lannisters on your own.

578
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,758
Who said anything about the Lannisters?

579
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:15,352
You'll have your gold
when we take the treasury at King's Landing.

580
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:17,271
All these kings fighting for the throne,

581
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,190
and this Stannis has the smallest army.

582
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,693
Why would I bet on the man
with the worst chance?

583
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,737
Because you're a smart gambler.

584
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:28,490
Stannis has proved himself in war twice.

585
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:31,744
His baby brother has never set foot
on a battlefield.

586
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:33,579
Neither has the false King Joffrey.

587
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,622
And yet they both have larger armies.

588
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,541
Stannis has just begun the fight.

589
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,586
His bannermen will rally to his cause.

590
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:45,591
There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms
more honorable than Stannis Baratheon

591
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,092
or more worthy of loyalty.

592
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:48,594
What is the world coming to

593
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:51,221
when smugglers must vouch
for the honor of kings?

594
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,640
- Mind your words, pirate.
- Matthos.

595
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,434
You think I'm insulted?

596
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,395
I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate.

597
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:00,439
I don't sail for promises.

598
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,982
Of course you do.

599
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:05,069
Every time you leave harbor,
you're leaving on a promise,

600
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:06,612
a promise that somewhere on the sea,

601
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:09,031
somebody's got some gold
and you can take it from him.

602
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,658
- That's a promise that always comes true.
- As is mine.

603
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:14,119
You're not a young man, Salladhor.

604
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:17,664
And correct me if I'm wrong,
most pirates don't grow old.

605
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,875
Only the clever ones.

606
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,753
You want to spend
your last few years on the sea

607
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:26,590
stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers
and Myrenese silk merchants, then go.

608
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,843
They're out there waiting for you. That's easy.

609
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:32,137
What I'm offering you is hard.

610
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:37,142
Come with me and plunder
the greatest city in Westeros.

611
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,896
You'll be the richest man in Lys,
and the most famous.

612
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,817
They'll be singing songs about you
as long as men have voices to sing.

613
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,862
"Salladhor Saan" is a good name for songs.

614
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:52,366
- It is.
- One thing, I want the queen.

615
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:55,327
- The queen?
- Cersei, I want her.

616
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,913
I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships.

617
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,165
And if we don't drown at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay,

618
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:03,460
I will fuck this blonde queen
and I'll fuck her well.

619
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:05,379
This war isn't about you.

620
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:09,133
We're not attacking King's Landing
so that you can rape the queen.

621
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,718
I'm not going to rape her.
I'm going to fuck her.

622
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,512
As if she would just let you.

623
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,430
You don't know how persuasive I am.

624
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,891
I've never tried to fuck you.

625
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:22,855
Stannis is the rightful king
and the Lord of Light,

626
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,398
the one true god...

627
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:25,983
I've been all over the world, my boy,

628
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:29,027
and everywhere I go,
people tell me about the true gods.

629
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:30,863
They all think they found the right one.

630
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:34,116
The one true god
is what's between a woman's legs,

631
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,743
and better yet, a queen's legs.

632
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,497
I never thought you'd have
a true believer for a son.

633
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:41,874
He's young yet.

634
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:46,128
I promise you the gold.
I promise you the glory.

635
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,713
I cannot promise you the queen.

636
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,093
You believe your king can win?

637
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,429
He is the one true king.

638
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,306
You Westerosi are funny people.

639
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,601
A man chops off your fingers
and you fall in love with him.

640
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:05,063
I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth.

641
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:07,900
You're the most honest smuggler I ever met.

642
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:11,028
Make me rich.

643
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:14,239
Get me to the gates
of King's Landing and I will.

644
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,920
When will the king have us sail?

645
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:30,047
As soon as his god wills it.

646
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:32,758
He's my god, too, and yours,

647
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:35,260
but you are too blind to see.

648
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,640
- Let me teach you how to read.
- Oh, you and your mother.

649
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:41,266
It won't take long.
You already know the letters.

650
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:43,560
The holy books are
much more persuasive than I can be.

651
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:45,395
I wish I had a god, truly.

652
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,232
I'm not mocking you,
but I've seen men pray to every god there is,

653
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,567
pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home.

654
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:53,362
- None of it works.
- But you always came home.

655
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:54,988
I wasn't praying.

656
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:57,741
But I was.

657
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,410
Every night that you were at sea,

658
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:03,330
I lit a candle and I prayed for you.

659
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,291
You want me to have a god?

660
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:09,461
Fine. King Stannis is my god.

661
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,964
He raised me up
and blessed me with his trust.

662
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:14,716
He gave you a future
I could never have imagined.

663
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:16,677
You know how to read.
You'll be a knight someday.

664
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:19,972
You think a fire god commanded all that?

665
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:23,350
It was Stannis, only Stannis.

666
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,395
Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.

667
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:29,231
Don't tell him that.

668
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,235
Lord Janos Slynt
was commander of the City Watch.

669
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,736
You had no right to exile him.

670
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,363
I have every right. I am the King's Hand.

671
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,157
You're serving as the King's Hand
till Father gets here.

672
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:40,575
I am Queen Regent.

673
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,286
Listen to me, Queen Regent.

674
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,829
You're losing the people.

675
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:46,832
- Do you hear me?
- The people.

676
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,625
You think I care?

677
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:52,546
You might find it difficult
to rule over millions who want you dead.

678
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:57,467
Half the city will starve when winter comes.
The other half will plot to overthrow you.

679
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:01,138
And your gold-plated thugs
just gave them their rallying cry,

680
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:03,974
"The Queen slaughters babies."

681
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,187
You don't even have the decency to deny it.

682
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:21,908
It wasn't you who gave the order, was it?

683
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:24,578
Joffrey didn't even tell you.

684
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:28,999
Did he tell you?

685
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,917
I imagine that would be even worse.

686
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,378
He did what needed to be done.

687
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:36,506
You want to be Hand of the King?
You want to rule?

688
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:39,968
This is what ruling is,
lying on a bed of weeds,

689
00:44:40,053 --> 00:44:41,845
ripping them out by the root, one by one,

690
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,638
before they strangle you in your sleep.

691
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:46,141
I'm no king,
but I think there's more to ruling than that.

692
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,768
I don't care what you think!

693
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:49,603
You've never taken it seriously.

694
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,396
You haven't, Jaime hasn't.

695
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:57,069
It's all fallen on me.

696
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:05,160
As has Jaime, repeatedly,
according to Stannis Baratheon.

697
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,125
You're funny.

698
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,048
You've always been funny...

699
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:22,344
but none of yourjokes will ever match
the first one, will they?

700
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,806
You remember?

701
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,226
Back when you ripped my mother open
on your way out of her

702
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,186
and she bled to death?

703
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:35,273
She was my mother, too.

704
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:36,942
Mother gone...

705
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:40,987
for the sake of you.

706
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:46,743
There's no biggerjoke in the world than that.

707
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,935
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

708
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,062
How did you fare with your pirate?

709
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:17,566
Salladhor Saan will join our fleet, 30 ships.

710
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,568
His men know how to fight.

711
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:23,113
In my experience,
pirates prefer fighting unarmed men.

712
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,614
It does seem the wiser choice.

713
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,033
There won't be a choice this time.

714
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,411
Do you trust him?

715
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,665
Salladhor Saan is an old friend.
I've known him 30 years.

716
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,667
I've never trusted him.

717
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:39,546
Now, once he gets the smell of gold
he never stops.

718
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:43,216
Well, if he does his job, he'll have his share.

719
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,013
Leave us.

720
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:55,729
At once, Your Grace.

721
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:06,072
The Lord of Light shines through you,
young warrior.

722
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,954
Come.

723
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:21,796
What did you say to him?

724
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:24,799
I told him death by fire is the purest death.

725
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,802
- Why?
- Because it is true.

726
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,264
You're troubled, my king.

727
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:33,433
Yeah.

728
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:36,102
These armies are toys for the Lord of Light.

729
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:39,189
Tell your lord to burn them, then.

730
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,690
I tell him nothing.

731
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:43,777
I pray for his commands and I obey.

732
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:49,616
My little brother has 100,000 men,
according to the scouts,

733
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,536
men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.

734
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,454
You must have faith.

735
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:55,956
Faith?

736
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:00,252
In a real war, the side with
the greater number wins,

737
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:01,962
nine times out of ten.

738
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:03,880
Then we must be the 10th.

739
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:07,092
I cannot defeat my brother in the field.

740
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:11,805
And I can't take King's Landing
without the men he's stolen.

741
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:16,977
I have seen the path to victory in the flames.

742
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:21,856
But first, you must give yourself
to the Lord of Light.

743
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:24,651
I've said the words, damn you.

744
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:30,574
I burned the idols.

745
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:37,372
You must give all of yourself.

746
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:43,753
I have a wife.

747
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,299
I took a vow.

748
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:52,512
She's sickly, weak...

749
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,433
Shut away in a tower.

750
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,769
She disgusts you.

751
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,984
And she's given you nothing,

752
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:09,779
no sons, only stillborns,

753
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:12,574
only death.

754
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:23,043
I will give you a son, my king.

755
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:27,088
A son?

1
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,787
Out, all of you.

2
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,958
This bastard's been meddling
where he shouldn't!

3
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:08,878
I want you and your men

4
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,255
gone.

5
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:15,134
And you will make this right.

6
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,764
Wait outside.

7
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,641
- Lord Commander...
- Now!

8
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,163
- Lord Commander...
- Leave us.

9
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,875
What did you do?

10
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,253
I followed him.

11
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,172
He took the baby
into the woods, the newborn.

12
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,924
What business is that of yours?

13
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,425
No, you don't understand.

14
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,970
He's killing them, all the boys.

15
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:05,893
You know.

16
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:13,860
Wildlings serve crueler gods than you or I.

17
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:19,031
Those boys are Craster's offerings.

18
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,408
Offerings?

19
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,618
He's murdering his own children.
He's a monster.

20
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,162
Aye, many a time
that monster has been the difference

21
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,582
between life and death for our rangers,

22
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,584
your uncle among them.

23
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,254
We have other wars to fight out there.

24
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:38,134
Like it or not, we need men like Craster.

25
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,640
I...

26
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,475
I saw it.

27
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,897
I saw

28
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,443
something take that child.

29
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:59,572
Yeah. Whatever it was,

30
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,241
I daresay you'll see it again.

31
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,204
Now, ready my horse.

32
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,540
We leave at dawn.

33
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,048
Don't lose it again.

34
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:42,782
Gilly.

35
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,703
You're leaving.

36
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,374
I... I wanted to give you something.

37
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,797
It belonged to my mother.

38
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,801
- I can't take it.
- Please.

39
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,970
I want you to.

40
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,558
My mother used it for sewing.

41
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:13,729
She'd let me sit with her in her chamber
while she sewed

42
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,606
and I'd read to her.

43
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,570
My father put a stop to it when he found out.

44
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,408
It's the only thing I have of hers.

45
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,744
She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.

46
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,372
You...

47
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,790
You shouldn't give it away.

48
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,750
I'm not giving it away.

49
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,753
I'm giving it to you.

50
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,258
Keep it safe for me.

51
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,927
Till I come back.

52
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,198
Hodor.

53
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,952
Rouse Bran, will you?
It's time for his lessons.

54
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,445
Every night it's the same.

55
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,156
I'm walking

56
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:49,617
and running, but...

57
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,497
I'm not... I'm not me.

58
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,958
I'm running through the godswood,

59
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,710
sniffing the dirt,

60
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,589
tasting blood in my mouth
when I've made a fresh kill,

61
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,217
howling.

62
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,763
Old Nan used to tell me stories

63
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,807
about magical people who could live

64
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,684
inside stags, birds,

65
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,645
wolves.

66
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,563
That's exactly what they are, Bran,

67
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,399
- stories.
- So she was lying?

68
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,736
- They don't exist?
- Well, they may have done.

69
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:28,489
But they're gone from the world,

70
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,574
along with much else.

71
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,871
These are dreams, Bran, nothing more.

72
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,582
No, my dreams are different.

73
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,543
Mine are true.

74
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,962
I dreamt of my father dying.

75
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,965
And Rickon had the same dream.

76
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,884
What about all the dreams you had
that didn't come true?

77
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,346
Hmm?

78
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,685
Right.

79
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,564
This link is made of Valyrian steel.

80
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,860
Only one maester in 100 wears it on his chain.

81
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:10,322
It signifies that I have
studied the higher mysteries.

82
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:14,743
And all who study these mysteries
try their hand at spells.

83
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,745
I was no different.

84
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,497
I was young.

85
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:22,710
And what boy doesn't secretly
wish for hidden powers

86
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:26,922
to lift him out of his dull life
into a special one?

87
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,301
But in the end, for all my efforts,

88
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:33,679
I got no more out of it
than a thousand boys before me.

89
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,473
Come on.

90
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,400
All right.

91
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:51,238
Maybe magic once was
a mighty force in the world.

92
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,326
But not anymore.

93
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,121
The dragons are gone.

94
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,290
The giants are dead.

95
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:06,462
And the Children of the Forest forgotten.

96
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,347
Loras! Highgarden!

97
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:04,645
Get him!

98
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,276
Oh!

99
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,738
Yield! I yield.

100
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,083
Well fought. Approach.

101
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,720
Rise. Remove your helm.

102
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,523
You are all your father promised
and more, my lady.

103
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,817
I've seen Ser Loras bested once or twice,

104
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,944
but never quite in that fashion.

105
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,990
Now, now, my love.
My brother fought valiantly for you.

106
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,618
That he did, my queen.

107
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,204
But there can only be one champion.

108
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,665
Brienne of Tarth,

109
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,834
you may ask anything of me you desire.

110
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,587
If it is within my power, it is yours.

111
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,549
Your Grace,

112
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,552
I ask the honor of a place in your Kingsguard.

113
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,346
What?

114
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,223
I will be one of your seven,
pledge my life to yours,

115
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,476
and keep you safe from all harm.

116
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,190
Done.

117
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,318
Rise, Brienne of the Kingsguard.

118
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,789
Your Grace, I have
the honor to bring you Lady Catelyn Stark,

119
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,833
sent as an envoy
by her son Robb, Lord of Winterfell.

120
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,128
Lord of Winterfell and King in the North.

121
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,382
Lady Catelyn. I'm pleased to see you.

122
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,469
May I present my wife,
Margaery of House Tyrell?

123
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,515
You are very welcome here, Lady Stark.

124
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,141
I'm so sorry for your loss.

125
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,395
You are most kind.

126
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,979
My lady,

127
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,651
I swear to you I will see the Lannisters answer
for your husband's murder.

128
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,987
When I take King's Landing,

129
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,156
I'll bring you Joffrey's head.

130
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,419
It will be enough
to know that justice was done, my lord.

131
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:34,837
Your Grace.

132
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,923
And you should kneel
when you approach the King.

133
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,260
There's no need for that.
Lady Stark is an honored guest.

134
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:44,513
Has your son marched against
Tywin Lannister yet?

135
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,850
I do not sit on my son's war councils.

136
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,937
And if I did,
I would not share his strategies with you.

137
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:55,023
If Robb Stark wants a pact with us,
he should come himself,

138
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,775
not hide behind his mother's skirts.

139
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,864
My son is fighting a war, not playing at one.

140
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,212
Don't worry, my lady.

141
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,381
Our war is just beginning.

142
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,480
- Your Grace.
- Gerard.

143
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,232
- How's your foot?
- Better, Your Grace.

144
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,568
They don't know their own size is all.

145
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,069
Good man.

146
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,741
I have 100,000 men at my command.

147
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,035
All the might of the Stormlands
and the Reach.

148
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:51,872
And all of them young and bold
like your Knight of Flowers?

149
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,958
It's a game to you, isn't it?

150
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,461
- I pity them.
- Why?

151
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,296
Because it won't last.

152
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,091
Because they are the knights of summer
and winter is coming.

153
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,472
Brienne, escort Lady Catelyn to her tent.

154
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:12,601
- She's tired from herjourney.
- At once, Your Grace.

155
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,062
- Shall I return after?
- That won't be necessary.

156
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,648
I would pray awhile. Alone.

157
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,401
If you'll follow me, my lady.

158
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,115
You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne.

159
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,493
I fought for my king.

160
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,496
Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield.

161
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,456
Die for him if I must.

162
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,544
And, if it please you, Brienne's enough.

163
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,338
I'm no lady.

164
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,663
What are you doing here?

165
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,373
I live here.

166
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,585
Are you angry with me, brother?

167
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,044
You lying bitch.

168
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,755
It's not my fault you didn't recognize me.

169
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,842
Recognize you? How could I?

170
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,011
The last time I saw you...

171
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,931
you looked like a fat little boy.

172
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,310
You were a fat little boy, too,

173
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,520
but I recognized you.

174
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,355
Why didn't you tell me?

175
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,441
I wanted to see who you were first.

176
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,234
And I did.

177
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,656
The plans are made. it's time you heard them.

178
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,658
- Father.
- Father.

179
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,455
The wolf pup has gone south

180
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:59,625
with the entirety
of the Northern army at his back.

181
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,461
While he's tangling with
the lion in the Westerlands,

182
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,963
the North is ripe for the taking.

183
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,675
The ironborn will reave and pillage,
as it was in the old days,

184
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,053
all along the northern coast.

185
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,972
We'll spread our dominion
across the green lands,

186
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,850
securing the Neck and everything above.

187
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,728
Every stronghold will yield to us,
one by one.

188
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,648
Winterfell may defy us for a year,
but what of it?

189
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,441
The rest shall be ours,

190
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,527
forest, field, and hall.

191
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,993
Yara, my daughter, you'll take 30 longships

192
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,870
to attack Deepwood Motte.

193
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,122
I've always wanted a castle.

194
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,500
And what's my role in all this?

195
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:46,880
You'll take a ship to raid
the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.

196
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,173
A ship?

197
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,717
You give her 30 and I get one?

198
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:54,096
The Sea Bitch.
We thought she'd be perfect for you.

199
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,058
I'm to fight fishermen?

200
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,185
Be careful of their nets.

201
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:07,359
Father, I fought with Robb Stark.
I know his men.

202
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,696
- He won't give up the North so easily.
- They won't even know we're there

203
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,531
- until it's too late.
- What do you know of it, woman?

204
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:13,990
I'm a proven warrior.

205
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:17,411
Your brothers were warriors,
both of them dead

206
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:20,914
at the hands of those
you seem so eager to protect.

207
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,751
I'm not protecting anyone.

208
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,837
I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait.

209
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:30,382
Why risk going against the North
if they would be our allies?

210
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,260
Rise up against them
and they could destroy us.

211
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,762
But if we pledge fealty to them,

212
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,681
they'll give us Casterly Rock.

213
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,516
What are our words?

214
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,602
Our words?

215
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,233
- We do not sow.
- We do not sow.

216
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,901
We are ironborn.

217
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,612
We're not subjects. We're not slaves.

218
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,741
We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine.

219
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,826
We take what is ours.

220
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,164
Your time with the wolves
has made you weak.

221
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,712
You act as if I volunteered to go.

222
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,090
You gave me away, if you remember.

223
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,509
The day you bent the knee
to Robert Baratheon.

224
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,595
After he crushed you.

225
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,472
Did you take what was yours then?

226
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,102
You gave me away!

227
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,688
Your boy!

228
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,065
Your last boy!

229
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:33,695
You gave me away
like I was some dog you didn't want anymore.

230
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:36,907
And now you curse me
because I've come home.

231
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:50,462
You'd have our father
bow down to your other family?

232
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,881
I have no other family.

233
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,341
Don't you?

234
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,804
Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly.

235
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,389
Our ships sail with or without you.

236
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,153
You won't let me leave this room.

237
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:18,073
- You won't let me...
- Keep your voice down.

238
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,745
Why? You think your father can hear me?

239
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,623
He's 300 miles away!

240
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,837
I don't intend for you to stay here.

241
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,215
I might be able to bring you into
the castle kitchens.

242
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,717
Again, only temporary.

243
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:43,265
Every man who has tasted my cooking
has told me what a good whore I am.

244
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,308
But you wouldn't be a cook.

245
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,186
You'd pose as a scullion.

246
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,107
Scullion? What is a scullion?

247
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:54,776
Kitchen wench.

248
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,737
- A kitchen wench?
- Yes, but...

249
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:01,950
Cleaning pots?
Is that how my lion wants to see me?

250
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,578
Your lion wants to see you alive.

251
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,872
We've come to a dangerous place.

252
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,832
My sister wants to hurt me.

253
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,876
She'll look for any weakness she can find.

254
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,961
She can't know about you.

255
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,171
I'm the weakness?

256
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,756
It's a compliment, my lady.

257
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,051
How is being a weakness a compliment?

258
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,307
Language can be a bit tricky here.

259
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,516
Oh.

260
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:28,894
I'm too stupid to understand.

261
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,104
The stupid foreign girl.

262
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,818
I am not a kitchen wench.

263
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:04,679
When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?

264
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,932
Soon, darling, when the war is over.

265
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,809
Mother says I'll have
a new gown for the ceremony

266
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,853
and another for the feast.

267
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:15,357
But yours will be ivory, since you're the bride.

268
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,947
The Princess just spoke to you.

269
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,615
Pardon, Your Grace.

270
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:28,828
I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella.

271
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:32,082
I'm counting the days
until the fighting is done

272
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,710
and I can pledge
my love to the King in sight of the gods.

273
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,384
Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?

274
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,763
He might.

275
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:51,101
Would you like that?

276
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,854
No. I don't think so.

277
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,985
Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty.

278
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,989
Won't you, little dove?

279
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,092
Come in.

280
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,014
Who are you?

281
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,808
I'm Shae, My Lady. Your new handmaiden.

282
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,478
I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden.

283
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,190
- You're not from here.
- No.

284
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,407
What are you doing?

285
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,200
Waiting for you to tell me what to do.

286
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:53,371
I shouldn't have to tell you to do things.
You should just do them.

287
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,540
What things?

288
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,209
Change my linens, wash my clothing,

289
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:01,546
scrub the floor,
empty my chamber pot, brush my hair.

290
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,390
- No.
- You said to brush...

291
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:13,975
Not now.

292
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:19,147
Your chamber pot is empty.

293
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,816
Clean the table.

294
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:29,574
Have you ever been a handmaiden before?

295
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,326
- Yes.
- For whom?

296
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,328
- Lady Zuriff.
- Lady Zuriff?

297
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,373
Lady Zuriff.

298
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,752
There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.

299
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,213
She wasn't in this city.

300
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,548
I don't know how they did things in that city,

301
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:48,384
but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies,

302
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,011
not the other way around.

303
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:52,931
And I don't have time
to answer a thousand questions

304
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,350
and teach you how to do your job.

305
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,146
Do you want me to leave?

306
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,073
Just brush my hair.

307
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,630
Oh!

308
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,382
Thank the gods.

309
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,634
I haven't had a proper shit in six days.

310
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,637
I've encountered
this problem before, my lord.

311
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,431
The stresses of power often have this

312
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:38,351
insalubrious effect.

313
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,062
Two drops with water, daily.

314
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:43,356
Right. I'm so grateful to have a man

315
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,317
of your vast knowledge
and wisdom on my side.

316
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,903
- Please.
- Thank you, my lord.

317
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,910
I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?

318
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,704
Why, yes, of course, my lord.

319
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,998
These are perilous times.

320
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,083
And the crown must forge new alliances.

321
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,588
And these alliances
must often be sealed in matrimony.

322
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,591
Matrimony, huh?

323
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,426
Yes.

324
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:15,638
I'm trusting the council with these plans,
but the Queen mustn't know.

325
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,183
We can't have her meddling in affairs

326
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:21,102
that could determine the future of the realm.
There's too much at stake.

327
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:23,771
Oh, yes, yes. indeed, yes.

328
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:26,441
I shall be silent as the grave.

329
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:31,070
I'm brokering an alliance
with House Martell of Dorne.

330
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:35,200
Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son
when she comes of age,

331
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:36,784
ensuring their loyalty

332
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,287
and their army, should we need it.

333
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:42,957
Myrcella sent away to Dorne?

334
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:48,004
But remember, the Queen mustn't know.

335
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,089
Ooh.

336
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,091
"The Queen mustn't know."

337
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,428
I love conversations that begin this way.

338
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,973
I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off

339
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:00,683
to Theon Greyjoy.

340
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:03,853
Theon Greyjoy?

341
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:07,398
Forgive me, my lord, but how?

342
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:10,026
He grew up a ward of Winterfell.

343
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,946
- He fights for Robb Stark.
- Precisely.

344
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:17,992
Theon's father loathes the Starks
and will convince the boy to come to our side.

345
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,579
Greyjoy can destroy
the Northern army from within

346
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:24,040
and we can have his father's ships.

347
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,876
But remember, you must tell no one.

348
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:30,129
Tell no one what?

349
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:33,967
I plan to wed Princess Myrcella
to Robin Arryn of the Vale.

350
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,513
Lysa is not fond of me.

351
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:44,560
But perhaps the promise of a royal match
will convince her to let bygones be bygones.

352
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:48,898
She imprisoned you.
She tried to execute you.

353
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:51,401
And you offer her son a princess?

354
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:55,738
For men in our position,
holding grudges can be

355
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,532
an encumbrance, don't you think?

356
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,786
And I suppose you want me
to broker this agreement?

357
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,329
Who better?

358
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:11,713
Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa,
if I cared to.

359
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:14,424
What's in it for me?

360
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:20,471
The gratitude of the people of Westeros
for helping to end this war,

361
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:24,809
the adoration of the King
for bringing the Vale back into the fold...

362
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:27,812
and Harrenhal.

363
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:30,064
Harrenhal is cursed.

364
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,734
Never took you for a superstitious man.

365
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:36,487
By all means, tear it down and rebuild.
You'll be able to afford it.

366
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:39,407
I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands.

367
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:44,120
With a single stroke, you'd make me
one of the greatest lords in the realm.

368
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:47,332
You served my family well
in the matter of the succession.

369
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:50,460
So did Janos Slynt,
and he was given Harrenhal, too.

370
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,587
Until you snatched it away.

371
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:55,757
I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn.

372
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,884
I didn't need Janos Slynt.

373
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,680
It's settled, then?

374
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,100
Good.

375
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,146
Oh. And remember...

376
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,231
The Queen mustn't know.

377
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,897
That must hurt.

378
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,742
What?

379
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,329
What is it?

380
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:12,333
A member of the Kingsguard?

381
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,170
As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.

382
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:21,926
Brienne is a very capable warrior.

383
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:25,847
And she's devoted to me.

384
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,225
You're jealous.

385
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,353
Jealous?

386
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,397
Of Brienne the Beauty?

387
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,858
Don't make me laugh.

388
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,737
- I'll make it up to you.
- No, Your Grace.

389
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,031
Not tonight.

390
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:48,202
There's another Tyrell
who requires your attention.

391
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:52,331
You didn't win my father's support
or his army on charm alone.

392
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:09,056
Your vassals are starting
to snigger behind your back.

393
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,268
Brides aren't usually virgins
two weeks after their wedding night.

394
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,312
And Margaery's a virgin?

395
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,314
Officially.

396
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,984
Shall I bring her to you?

397
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:50,640
I should warn you,
I've had quite a bit of wine.

398
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,934
As is your right. You are a king.

399
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,355
You look very beautiful.

400
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,190
Thank you, Your Grace.

401
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,527
- It's a lovely gown.
- You think so?

402
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,821
I can't decide how I like it better.

403
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:07,156
This way,

404
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:10,618
or this way.

405
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,793
You certainly don't need it.

406
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:25,341
Although, some say the beauty most desired

407
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,385
is the beauty concealed.

408
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,195
Must be the wine.

409
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,114
Here, let me.

410
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:09,594
I'm sorry.

411
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,556
Do you want my brother to come in and help?

412
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,227
- What?
- He could get you started.

413
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:19,562
I know he wouldn't mind.

414
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,106
Or I can turn over
and you can pretend I'm him.

415
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,777
I don't know what you're talking about.

416
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,994
There's no need for us to play games.

417
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,623
Save your lies for court.
You're going to need a lot of them.

418
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:02,146
Your enemies aren't happy about us.
They want to tear us apart.

419
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,482
And the best way to stop them

420
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,276
is to put your baby

421
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,071
in my belly.

422
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,785
We can try again later.

423
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:20,081
You decide how you want to do it,
with me, with me and Loras,

424
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,041
however else you like.

425
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:27,380
Whatever you need to do.

426
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:32,051
You are a king.

427
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,104
You monster.

428
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,023
Myrcella is my only daughter.

429
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:48,734
Do you really think
I'll let you sell her like a common whore?

430
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:51,946
Myrcella's a princess.
Some would say she was born for this.

431
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,783
I will not let you ship her off to Dorne
as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.

432
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,035
Dorne is the safest place for her.

433
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,122
Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.

434
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,999
That's why we need to seduce them.

435
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:07,586
We're going to need their support in the war
your son started.

436
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:09,964
- She'll be a hostage.
- A guest.

437
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:13,134
You won't get away with this.

438
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:16,470
You think the piece of paper Father gave you
keeps you safe.

439
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,517
Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too.

440
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,355
- It's done, Cersei.
- No.

441
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:29,859
- You cannot stop it.
- No!

442
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:36,365
Just how safe do you think Myrcella is
if this city falls?

443
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:40,369
Do you want to see her raped,
butchered like the Targaryen children?

444
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:42,121
Make no mistake.

445
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,832
They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike
right beside yours.

446
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,834
Get out! Get out!

447
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:52,149
Theon of the House Greyjoy,

448
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:55,319
you would this day
consecrate your faith to the Drowned God?

449
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,121
- I would.
- Kneel.

450
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,001
Let Theon, your servant,

451
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:13,838
be born again from the sea as you were.

452
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:16,632
Bless him with salt.

453
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,345
Bless him with stone.

454
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:23,806
Bless him with steel.

455
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:33,440
What is dead may never die.

456
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:38,237
But rises again harder and stronger.

457
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:40,739
Stand.

458
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,605
I don't appreciate
being made a fool of, dwarf.

459
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,441
If Myrcella marries the Martell boy,

460
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:17,985
she can't very well
marry Robin Arryn, can she?

461
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:21,071
No, afraid not. Sorry about that.

462
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,448
And Harrenhal,

463
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:26,076
I suppose that's off the table as well.

464
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:29,705
Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too.

465
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,333
Leave me out of your next deception.

466
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,126
That's a shame.

467
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,754
You were to be
the centerpiece of my next deception.

468
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:40,424
My brother Jaime rots in a northern stockade.

469
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:44,345
I would see him released.
That's where you come in.

470
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,889
Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.

471
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,934
No, he won't. But his mother might.

472
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:53,729
How would you like to see
your beloved Cat again?

473
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,193
- Find him?
- Oh, aye.

474
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:01,195
And he has company.

475
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,532
Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt.

476
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,034
No, you don't.

477
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:08,911
No, I don't.

478
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:18,504
What is the meaning of this?

479
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,798
No, please, please.

480
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:23,008
You disappoint me, Grand Maester.

481
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:25,302
I am your loyal servant.

482
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:29,139
So loyal that you told the Queen
about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.

483
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:31,058
No! Never!

484
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,435
It's a falsehood. I swear it.

485
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:35,104
It wasn't me.

486
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,356
Ah, Varys.

487
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,150
It was Varys the Spider.

488
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:44,321
See, I told Varys that
I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys.

489
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:48,784
I told Littlefinger
that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn.

490
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,162
I told no one
that I was offering her to the Dornish.

491
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,957
No one but you.

492
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,501
The eunuch has spies everywhere.

493
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,628
Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.

494
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:02,464
- No, no, no.
- There are no goats, half man.

495
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:03,841
Well, make do.

496
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,804
How long have you been spying for my sister?

497
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,724
All I did, I did for House Lannister.

498
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:14,059
Always. Your lord father, ask him.

499
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:17,646
I've always been his servant
since the days of the Mad King.

500
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,775
- I don't like his beard.
- What?

501
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:24,903
What? No. No.

502
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:30,909
How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle?

503
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:33,037
Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?

504
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:35,039
Lord Arryn, he knew.

505
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:37,791
He knew the truth about the Queen.

506
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:43,255
And... he planned to act, to tell King Robert.

507
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,631
So you poisoned him?

508
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,051
No. Never.

509
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:49,845
But you let him die,
made sure he succumbed.

510
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,556
Lannister... l always served Lannister.

511
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,309
Get him out of my sight.
Throw him in one of the black cells.

512
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,102
No. No, no, no. No, please.

513
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:59,146
Don't! You can't do this to me!

514
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:01,982
For your trouble.

515
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:29,051
You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend

516
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:32,012
is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service.

517
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,808
Good. One of my better ideas.

518
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:40,187
And it seems the Grand Maester
has found his way into a black cell?

519
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,858
Well played, My Lord Hand.

520
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,612
But should I be worried?

521
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,656
Janos Slynt, Pycelle...

522
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,534
The Small Council grows smaller every day.

523
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:57,037
The Council has a reputation
for serving past Hands poorly.

524
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:59,790
I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.

525
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,502
Power is a curious thing, my lord.

526
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,588
Are you fond of riddles?

527
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:08,674
Why, am I about to hear one?

528
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,968
Three great men sit in a room.

529
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,846
A king, a priest and a rich man.

530
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,640
Between them stands a common sellsword.

531
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:20,435
Each great man
bids the sellsword kill the other two.

532
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,230
Who lives, who dies?

533
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:25,607
Depends on the sellsword.

534
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:29,987
Does it? He has neither crown
nor gold nor favor with the gods.

535
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:32,239
He has a sword, the power of life and death.

536
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:36,994
But if it's swordsmen who rule,
why do we pretend kings hold all the power?

537
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:41,874
When Ned Stark lost his head,
who was truly responsible?

538
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,336
Joffrey? The executioner?
Or something else?

539
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,630
I've decided I don't like riddles.

540
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:55,345
Power resides where men believe it resides.

541
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,975
It's a trick, a shadow on the wall.

542
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:06,982
And a very small man
can cast a very large shadow.

543
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:49,274
You should be sleeping.

544
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,486
Tomorrow's a long march.

545
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,822
Thirty miles, if it don't piss on us.

546
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:58,700
I can't sleep.

547
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:05,499
I don't like the taste.

548
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:14,675
You don't drink it for the flavor, to be honest.

549
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,059
What?

550
00:43:25,395 --> 00:43:27,062
How do you sleep?

551
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:29,564
Same as most men, I think.

552
00:43:29,983 --> 00:43:32,359
But you've seen things,

553
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,404
horrible things.

554
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:37,531
Aye.

555
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,535
I've seen some pretty things, too,

556
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,537
but not nearly so many.

557
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:47,541
How do you sleep when you...

558
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:53,213
When you have those things in your head?

559
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,467
You didn't see that.

560
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,220
I made damn sure.

561
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:02,431
I close my eyes and I see them up there.

562
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,559
All of them

563
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:07,978
standing there.

564
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,605
Joffrey,

565
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:15,277
the Queen and...

566
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,572
and my sister.

567
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:31,668
You know, we've got
something in common, me and you.

568
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:33,170
You know that?

569
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:35,964
I must have been

570
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:39,426
a couple of years older than you.

571
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,597
I saw my brother stabbed through the heart

572
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,974
right on our doorstep.

573
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:49,102
He weren't much of a villain
what skewered him.

574
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,688
Willem, the lad's name was.

575
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:56,151
He ran off before anyone could spit.

576
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:59,237
And I just stood there,

577
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:02,324
watching my brother die.

578
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,119
Here's the funny part.

579
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,956
I can't picture my brother's face anymore.

580
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,334
But Willem,

581
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,003
oh, he was a nice-looking boy.

582
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:20,967
He had good white teeth, blue eyes,

583
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:25,347
one of those dimpled chins all the girls like.

584
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:31,019
I would think about him when I was working,

585
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:34,147
when I was drinking,
when I was having a shit.

586
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,025
It got to the point

587
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:40,612
where I would say his name every night
before I went to bed.

588
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,531
Willem. Willem.

589
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,574
Willem.

590
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,702
A prayer almost.

591
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:51,498
Well, one day,

592
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,336
Willem came riding back into town.

593
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:05,804
I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull
they had to bury him with it.

594
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:13,854
Willem's horse got me to the Wall
and I've been wearing black ever since.

595
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:22,487
That'll help you sleep, eh?

596
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:30,370
Ho!

597
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:33,540
Get up, you lazy sons of whores!

598
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,292
Arm yourselves.

599
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:38,086
- Get up.
- Get up.

600
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,172
Keep out of sight, both of you.

601
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:41,590
- No, I'm not afraid.
- I can fight.

602
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:43,300
Keep out of sight.

603
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:46,553
If things go wrong, you run.

604
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:50,557
Do you hear me?
You run along north and don't look back.

605
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:55,395
Hey, there's men out there
who want to fuck your corpses.

606
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,689
Outside, now!

607
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,401
Come on, move, move!

608
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:04,738
Gold cloaks!

609
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:11,995
Everyone out!

610
00:47:16,918 --> 00:47:20,086
Hey, you! Open the damn cage!

611
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:25,467
Where's the bastard, crow?

612
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:28,011
Got more than a few bastards here.
Who's asking?

613
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:31,181
Ser Amory Lorch,
sworn bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister.

614
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:34,643
These men from the capital
requested our assistance.

615
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:37,437
Drop your weapons in the name of the King.

616
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:39,356
Now, which king would that be?

617
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,441
This is your last chance.

618
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:46,238
In the name of King Joffrey,
drop your weapons.

619
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:51,576
I don't think I will.

620
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,286
So be it.

621
00:47:56,874 --> 00:48:00,126
I always hated crossbows.
Take too long to load.

622
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,375
Boy, come here. Boy!

623
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,878
- Sweet boy, help us.
- Come back here!

624
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:45,088
Help us, boy!

625
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:51,553
A man can fight! Free us!

626
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:00,520
Quick, give it to me.

627
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,523
Give me the ax. Give me that.

628
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,951
Put them on the wagon!

629
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:17,329
There's more here. Come on.

630
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,669
What do we have here?

631
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,672
No!

632
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:30,383
That's a fine little blade.

633
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:33,637
Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.

634
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,388
I yield! I yield!

635
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:37,682
Round up any survivors.

636
00:49:37,767 --> 00:49:39,893
We'll take them back to Harrenhal.

637
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,604
You heard him. You're coming with us.

638
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:45,023
I yield!

639
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:51,780
Help!

640
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:53,281
Help me!

641
00:49:57,662 --> 00:49:59,245
Something wrong with your leg, boy?

642
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,081
Look at it.

643
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,674
Can you walk?

644
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,967
No. You got to carry me.

645
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:15,845
All right.

646
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,320
"Carry him," he says.

647
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,623
We're looking for a bastard named Gendry.

648
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:45,917
Give him up

649
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:48,712
or I'll start taking eyeballs.

650
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:02,809
You want Gendry?

651
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,648
You already got him.

652
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:14,696
He loved that helmet.

1
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:03,164
It's got to be the Mountain.
He's the biggest.

2
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,583
- He's the strongest.
- Bulls are bigger than lions.

3
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,460
Doesn't mean I'd pick a bull in a fight.

4
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,630
If the bull had fangs and claws, I would.

5
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:14,383
Right, the Mountain or our man Jaime.

6
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,969
If he ever gets out.

7
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,596
Loras Tyrell?

8
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,808
Loras Tyrell. He's prettier than the Queen.

9
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:24,644
I don't care about pretty.
He's better with a sword than any of them.

10
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,979
How good could he be?

11
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:31,234
He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years,
and Renly ain't dead.

12
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,870
The horses seem a little spooked to you?

13
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:44,497
They're horses.

14
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:47,166
They get spooked by their own shadows.

15
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,839
Do you hear that?

16
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:55,716
No.

17
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,803
There's something out there.

18
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,869
Oh.

19
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,872
Oh, you're a right little prick.

20
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,498
You should see your face.

21
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,625
I swear you pissed yourself.

22
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:31,711
"Oh, who goes there? Ahh!"

23
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,046
There is something out there.

24
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,215
Yeah, don't even try me.

25
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,801
- Rennick.
- Do you think I'm an idiot?

26
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,470
Rennick!

27
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:51,480
- King in the North!
- The King in the North!

28
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:14,378
Five Lannisters dead
for every one of ours.

29
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,255
They're dead.
Take everything they've got.

30
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,007
We've nowhere to keep
all these prisoners.

31
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,927
Barely enough food to feed our own.

32
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,929
We're not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton.

33
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,597
Of course, Your Grace.

34
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:27,183
The officers will be useful.

35
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:30,269
Some of them may be privy
to Tywin Lannister's plans.

36
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:31,354
I doubt it.

37
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,981
Well, we'll learn soon enough.

38
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:38,152
In my family, we say,
"A naked man has few secrets.

39
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,029
"A flayed man none."

40
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,114
My father outlawed flaying in the North.

41
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,326
- We're not in the North.
- We're not torturing them.

42
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,328
The high road's very pretty,

43
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,121
but you'll have a hard time
marching your army down it.

44
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,959
The Lannisters hold prisoners of their own.

45
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,087
I won't give them an excuse
to abuse my sisters.

46
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,632
No, don't! Don't! Please!

47
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,430
The rot's set in.

48
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,391
No, don't! No, don't!

49
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,644
- Shh.
- Please, don't!

50
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,604
It'll get better. it doesn't even hurt.

51
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:16,565
The rot will spread.
If we don't take the foot now...

52
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:18,442
No, you can't!

53
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,739
Ser! Please, ser.

54
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,324
- I can't lose...
- You'll die if she doesn't.

55
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,326
I don't want to be a cripple, please.

56
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:30,246
Surely one of our men
needs your attention more than this cub.

57
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:32,707
Your men are not my men, my lord.

58
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,334
Put this in your mouth and lie down.
You don't want to watch.

59
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,920
- No! You can't!
- Bite on it.

60
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,214
It's better than biting your own tongue,
believe me.

61
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,293
- What's your name?
- Talisa.

62
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:19,336
Your last name?

63
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,714
You want to know what side
my family fights on?

64
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,716
You know my family name.
You have me at a disadvantage.

65
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,427
That boy lost his foot on your orders.

66
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,013
They killed my father.

67
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,932
- That boy did?
- The family he fights for.

68
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,769
Do you think he's friends with King Joffrey?

69
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,688
He's a fisherman's son
that grew up near Lannisport.

70
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:40,816
He probably never held a spear before they
shoved one in his hands a few months ago.

71
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,902
I have no hatred for the lad.

72
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,322
That should help his foot grow back.

73
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:53,370
You'd have us surrender,
end all this bloodshed.

74
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:56,415
I understand. The country would be at peace

75
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,835
and life would be just under
the righteous hand of good King Joffrey.

76
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,713
- You're going to kill Joffrey?
- If the gods give me strength.

77
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:05,007
- And then what?
- I don't know.

78
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,260
We'll go back to Winterfell.

79
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,970
I have no desire to sit on the lron Throne.

80
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,681
So who will?

81
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,642
I don't know.

82
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,936
You're fighting to overthrow a king,

83
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,395
and yet you have no plan
for what comes after?

84
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,856
First we have to win the war.

85
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,656
You never told me where you're from.

86
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,700
- Volantis.
- Volantis? You're far from home.

87
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,788
The boy was lucky you were here.

88
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,082
He was unlucky that you were.

89
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,844
You're here to answer
for your brother's latest treasons.

90
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,887
Your Grace,

91
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:55,141
whatever my traitor brother has done,
I had no part.

92
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,642
You know that. I beg you, please...

93
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,477
Ser Lancel, tell her of this outrage.

94
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:00,229
Using some vile sorcery,

95
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,274
your brother fell on Stafford Lannister
with an army of wolves.

96
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,277
Thousands of good men were butchered.

97
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:10,531
After the slaughter,
the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain.

98
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,202
Killing you
would send your brother a message.

99
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,250
But my mother insists on keeping you alive.

100
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:22,918
Stand.

101
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:28,132
So we'll have to send
your brother a message some other way.

102
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,343
Meryn.

103
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,684
Leave her face. I like her pretty.

104
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,402
Meryn, my lady is overdressed.

105
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,779
Unburden her.

106
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,748
If you want Robb Stark to hear us,
we're going to have to speak louder.

107
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,543
What is the meaning of this?

108
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,846
What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?

109
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:18,057
The kind who serves his king, lmp.

110
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:21,310
Careful, now. We don't want to get blood
all over your pretty white cloak.

111
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,230
Someone get the girl
something to cover herself with.

112
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,649
She is to be your queen.

113
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,400
Have you no regard for her honor?

114
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,736
- I'm punishing her.
- For what crimes?

115
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,988
She did not fight her brother's battle,
you half-wit.

116
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,824
You can't talk to me like that.
The king can do as he likes!

117
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,661
The Mad King did as he liked.

118
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,789
Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you
what happened to him?

119
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:44,792
No one threatens His Grace
in the presence of the Kingsguard.

120
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:48,504
I'm not threatening the king, ser.
I am educating my nephew.

121
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,674
Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks,
kill him.

122
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,053
That was a threat. See the difference?

123
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,036
I apologize for my nephew's behavior.

124
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,583
Tell me the truth.
Do you want an end to this engagement?

125
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,878
I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love.

126
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:38,220
Lady Stark, you may survive us yet.

127
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,727
The little king's backed up.

128
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,479
Clogged from balls to brains.

129
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,774
You think dipping his wick
will cure what ails him?

130
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,235
There's no cure for being a cunt.

131
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,988
But the boy's at that age.

132
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,658
And he's got nothing to do all day
but pick wings off flies.

133
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:02,411
Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out.

134
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,879
What are you doing here, dog?

135
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:16,425
Your uncle left your nameday present
and asked me to see that you got it.

136
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:20,929
And?

137
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,182
What is it?

138
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,976
Look inside, Your Grace.

139
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,650
Your Grace.

140
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:37,613
- Happy nameday, Your Grace.
- My nameday has passed.

141
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,115
We won't tell if you won't.

142
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,120
No.

143
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:47,831
Her.

144
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,752
Touch her.

145
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,025
Could you hit her?

146
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,165
My uncle sent you?

147
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,669
Yes, Your Grace. He chose us himself.

148
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,295
Hmm.

149
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,181
Use this.

150
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,654
Harder.

151
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,537
I said harder.

152
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,001
He'd want me to get his money's worth.

153
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:00,088
Your Grace, too much pain
will spoil the pleasure.

154
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:10,766
Please, Your Grace.

155
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,520
Your Grace, if your uncle finds out...

156
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,563
Oh, I want him to find out.

157
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:20,400
You will bring her
to his chambers when you're finished

158
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,236
and show him what you've done,

159
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,448
or the same thing will happen to you.

160
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,540
Begin.

161
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,675
Harder!

162
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:58,981
Well, if it isn't my favorite whoremonger.

163
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:02,776
Pray I haven't kept you waiting long.

164
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,738
Your Grace.

165
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,203
Now you do the Lannisters' bidding,
is that it?

166
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:18,667
Tell me, was my brother's body even cold
before you secured your newest patron?

167
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,836
I'm a practical man.

168
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,506
Just not a loyal one.

169
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,258
And who would you have me be loyal to?

170
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,218
Your brother's corpse?

171
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,348
I don't like you, Lord Baelish.

172
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,393
I don't like your face.

173
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,229
I don't like the words
that come oozing out of your mouth.

174
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:43,150
I don't want you in my tent
one minute more than necessary.

175
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,652
So tell me, why are you here?

176
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:51,199
You can trust Brienne.
Her loyalty comes without charge.

177
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,997
You still have many friends
at court, Your Grace,

178
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:01,918
many who believe Ned Stark erred
by not supporting your claim.

179
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,547
Now I understand.

180
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:11,094
You know I have the numbers.
You know I'm marching on King's Landing.

181
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,890
When I take the throne,
you hope to retain your position.

182
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,060
And your head.

183
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,103
I would give priority to my head.

184
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:25,859
I understand that you don't like me,
and while that saddens me greatly,

185
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,487
I did not come here today
seeking your affection.

186
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,157
When you march on King's Landing,

187
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,369
you may find yourself facing
a protracted siege or...

188
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,580
open gates.

189
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:58,433
Your Grace.

190
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,976
Lord Baelish.

191
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:04,564
All of these tents look the same to me.

192
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,983
- Would you be so kind...
- It would be my pleasure.

193
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,444
It took me weeks
to learn my way around the camp.

194
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,948
Twice I walked in on officers
in stages of undress.

195
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:17,077
And the moment I learn which tent is mine,
we're on the move again.

196
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,787
"Your tent"?

197
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,789
Not "Our tent"?

198
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,961
The king snores, perhaps?
Or simply prefers solitude?

199
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,715
Pressures of command, no doubt.

200
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,134
Four kings vying for the throne.

201
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,386
I am not tutored in warfare,

202
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,306
but basic arithmetic
favors the side with the greater numbers.

203
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:42,310
If war were arithmetic,
the mathematicians would rule the world.

204
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:46,523
I did notice your brother
entering His Grace's tent just now.

205
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,734
The place of a Kingsguard
is by the king's side.

206
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:53,113
And on the night of your wedding,
who was by the king's side then?

207
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,574
You seem quite interested in our marriage.

208
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,243
Your marriage is quite interesting.

209
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,121
Not only to me, but to the realm.

210
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:06,501
The marriage of a wealthy girl
always breeds interest, if nothing else.

211
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,587
You've never married, have you?

212
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:13,008
I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly.

213
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,927
That is sad.

214
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,429
Though perhaps it's for the best.

215
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,514
The whole notion of marriage
seems to confuse you,

216
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,516
so allow me to explain.

217
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:25,103
My husband is my king,
and my king is my husband.

218
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,691
Here is your tent, Lord Baelish. Good night.

219
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,351
This isn't your horse.

220
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,314
It was given to me by the Thirteen.

221
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,899
The Elders of Qarth.

222
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,275
Qarth?

223
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,862
Three days to the east, on the sea.

224
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,073
Will they let us in?

225
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:21,952
They said they would be honored
to receive the Mother of Dragons.

226
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,207
What do you know of this place?

227
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,336
Only that the desert around their walls
is called the Garden of Bones.

228
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:36,633
Every time the Qartheen
shut their gates on a traveler,

229
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,260
the garden grows.

230
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,567
- Go on!
- You, keep moving!

231
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,784
Bring her about!

232
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,120
What kind of fire melts stone?

233
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,331
Dragon fire.

234
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,083
There's dragons here?

235
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,711
No, all the dragons are dead.

236
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,796
What's that smell?

237
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:18,466
Dead people.

238
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:20,510
Move.

239
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,105
Please, please, no, no!

240
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,822
No.

241
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,876
He's dead.

242
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,880
He was my son.

243
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,676
My sister was three days ago.

244
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:05,513
My husband, the day before that.

245
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:09,100
They take someone every day?

246
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:13,021
Does anyone live?

247
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,088
Joffrey.

248
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,507
Cersei.

249
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:42,759
Ilyn Payne.

250
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,552
The Hound.

251
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,388
Joffrey.

252
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,932
Cersei.

253
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,601
Ilyn Payne.

254
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:53,436
The Hound.

255
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,231
Joffrey. Cersei.

256
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,900
Ilyn Payne. The Hound.

257
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,615
How dare you?

258
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,701
You may have heard false reports.

259
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,995
- You betrayed Ned.
- Betrayed?

260
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,871
I wanted him to serve
as Protector of the Realm.

261
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,748
I begged him to seize the moment.

262
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:17,210
I trusted you. My husband trusted you.

263
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:21,089
And you repaid our faith with treachery.

264
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:22,298
- No, my lady.
- Get out!

265
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:23,800
Cat, I've...

266
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,137
I've loved you since I was a boy.

267
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,224
It seems to me that fate
has given us this chance...

268
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:33,977
Have you lost your mind? Get out!

269
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:50,118
Do you want to see your girls again?

270
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:55,623
Sansa, more beautiful than ever?

271
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,753
And Arya, just as wild as ever?

272
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,464
You have Arya, too?

273
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:06,468
Both girls are healthy and safe.

274
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,054
For now.

275
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,932
But you know the Queen
and you know Joffrey.

276
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:18,146
I fear for their longevity
if they remain in the capital.

277
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:41,628
What do you want?

278
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:46,257
The Lannisters will trade your daughters
for the Kingslayer.

279
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,093
Of course they will.

280
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:50,553
Jaime Lannister for two girls?

281
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,889
Robb will never agree to those terms.

282
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,141
I'm not bringing these terms to him.

283
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,518
I'm bringing them to you.

284
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:59,270
You think I keep secrets from my son?

285
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:02,023
Robb has surprised them all
with his skills in battle,

286
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,149
but he's not a mother.

287
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,027
Consider it, Cat.

288
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,906
You may not get another chance.

289
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,830
- I've brought you a gift.
- I don't want your gifts.

290
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:19,707
A token of Tyrion Lannister's goodwill.

291
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:24,045
He wants you to understand
that this exchange of prisoners

292
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,297
is offered in good faith.

293
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:27,715
Good faith?

294
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:33,972
What's this?

295
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,795
Your husband was an honorable man.

296
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:10,300
He should rest beside his family
in the crypts beneath Winterfell.

297
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:17,432
- You may not believe...
- Get out.

298
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,133
Get up, you dogs!

299
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,688
That's him, the one who picks.

300
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,650
The Mountain.

301
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,404
What are you doing?

302
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,115
He told me he stares at him every day.

303
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,159
That's why he doesn't get picked.

304
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:44,852
You.

305
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,522
Move, boy!

306
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:49,357
Move!

307
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,462
Is there gold and silver
in the village?

308
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,464
- I don't know.
- Gems?

309
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,175
I didn't see any.

310
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,303
- Where is the Brotherhood?
- I don't know.

311
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:37,113
- Where is the Brotherhood?
- I don't know. Please.

312
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:40,116
- Where is the Brotherhood?
- I don't know.

313
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,790
Which of the villagers aided them?

314
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,584
- I don't know.
- Who?

315
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,085
I...

316
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:59,260
- Who?
- I never saw.

317
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:02,680
Please. Please, stop. Please, it's starting to...

318
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:05,016
- Who?
- I didn't see anyone help him.

319
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,269
Take it off! Take it off!

320
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:10,813
- Who helped him?
- Ganes, the butcher,

321
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:12,565
- and his son.
- That's better.

322
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:15,693
- You've been very helpful.
- No, stop, please!

323
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:18,279
What are you doing? Please, stop!

324
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:20,656
Please, stop! No! No!

325
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:23,117
I told you everything! No!

326
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,161
No!

327
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:28,581
Joffrey.

328
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,334
Cersei.

329
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:34,337
Ilyn Payne. The Hound.

330
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:37,006
Please, Polliver. Some food.

331
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:39,550
Just a crust of bread.

332
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,264
Polliver.

333
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,642
The Mountain.

334
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:08,413
Lady Stark, I had not thought
to find you in the Stormlands.

335
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:11,499
I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis.

336
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,961
- Can that truly be you?
- Who else might it be?

337
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,172
When I saw your standard, I couldn't be sure.

338
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,758
- Whose banner is that?
- My own.

339
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:25,763
I suppose if we used the same one,
the battle would be terribly confusing.

340
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:28,349
Why is your stag on fire?

341
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:33,604
The king has taken for his sigil
the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.

342
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:37,692
Ah, you must be this fire priestess
we hear so much about.

343
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:39,902
Mmm, brother,

344
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:43,156
now I understand
why you found religion in your old age.

345
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,740
Watch yourself, Renly.

346
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,868
No, no, I'm relieved.

347
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,204
I never really believed you were a fanatic.

348
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,166
Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes,

349
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,042
but not a godly man.

350
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,837
You should kneel before your brother.

351
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,839
He's the Lord's chosen,

352
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:02,216
born amidst salt and smoke.

353
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:04,135
Born amidst salt and smoke?

354
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,722
- Is he a ham?
- That's twice I've warned you.

355
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,640
Listen to yourselves.

356
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:12,685
If you were sons of mine,
I would knock your heads together

357
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:16,397
and lock you in a bedchamber
until you remembered that you were brothers.

358
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,108
It is strange to find you
beside my brother, Lady Stark.

359
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,819
Your husband was a supporter of my claim.

360
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,905
Lord Eddard's integrity cost him his head.

361
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:27,033
And you sit beside this pretender
and chastise me.

362
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:28,659
We share a common enemy.

363
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:31,579
The lron Throne is mine by right.

364
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,749
All those that deny that are my foes.

365
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:39,337
The whole realm denies it,
from Dorne to the Wall.

366
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,172
Old men deny it with their death rattle

367
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,633
and unborn children deny it
in their mother's wombs.

368
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,179
No one wants you for their king.

369
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:51,140
You never wanted any friends, brother.

370
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,559
But a man without friends
is a man without power.

371
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:59,774
For the sake of the mother who bore us,
I will give you this one night to reconsider.

372
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:04,362
Strike your banners,
come to me before dawn,

373
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:08,282
and I will grant you
your old seat in the Council.

374
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,285
I'll even name you my heir

375
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:13,621
until a son is born to me.

376
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,959
Otherwise I shall destroy you.

377
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,673
Look across those fields, brother.

378
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,551
Can you see all those banners?

379
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:29,053
You think a few bolts of cloth
will make you king?

380
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,179
No.

381
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:34,392
The men holding those bolts of cloth
will make me king.

382
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,561
We shall see, Renly.

383
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,813
Come the dawn, we shall see.

384
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,482
Look to your sins, Lord Renly.

385
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,651
The night is dark and full of terrors.

386
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:52,660
Would you believe I loved him once?

387
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,516
I thought we were welcome.

388
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,185
If you heard a Dothraki horde
was approaching your city,

389
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,104
you might do the same, Khaleesi.

390
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:23,858
Horde?

391
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,626
My name is Daenerys...

392
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,545
Daenerys Stormborn of the house Targaryen.

393
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,756
You know me, my lord?

394
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,966
Only by reputation, Khaleesi.

395
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:52,428
And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant.

396
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:56,891
They call you the Mother of Dragons.

397
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,643
And what should I call you?

398
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,353
Oh, my name is quite long

399
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:03,105
and quite impossible
for foreigners to pronounce.

400
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:06,192
I am simply a trader of spices.

401
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,612
But we are the Thirteen,

402
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:13,616
charged with the governance
and protection of Qarth,

403
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:16,827
the greatest city that ever was or will be.

404
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,749
- The beauty of Quarth is legendary...
- Qarth.

405
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:25,795
Qarth.

406
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,422
Might we see the dragons?

407
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,347
My friend,

408
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,600
we have traveled very far.

409
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,894
We have no food, no water.

410
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:44,647
Once I see my people fed,
I would be honored...

411
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:47,108
Forgive me, Mother of Dragons,

412
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:50,945
but no man alive has seen a living dragon.

413
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,823
Some of my more skeptical friends

414
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:57,118
refuse to believe your children

415
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:59,203
even exist.

416
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:02,289
All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves.

417
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,625
I am not a liar.

418
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,752
Oh, I don't think you are.

419
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,337
But as I've never met you before,

420
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:11,006
my opinion on the matter is of limited value.

421
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,969
Where I come from,

422
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:20,975
guests are treated with respect,
not insulted at the gates.

423
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,353
Then perhaps you should
return to where you come from.

424
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:26,063
We wish you well.

425
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,736
What are you doing?

426
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,155
You promised to receive me.

427
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,991
We have received you.

428
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:39,326
Here we are, and here you are.

429
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:43,539
If you do not let us in, all of us will die.

430
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:46,000
Which we shall deeply regret.

431
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,587
But Qarth did not become
the greatest city that ever was or will be

432
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:52,923
by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.

433
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,433
Khaleesi, please be careful.

434
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,353
Thirteen!

435
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:13,527
When my dragons are grown,
we will take back what was stolen from me

436
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:15,821
and destroy those who have wronged me.

437
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:20,493
We will lay waste to armies
and burn cities to the ground.

438
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:24,914
Turn us away and we will burn you first.

439
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:27,792
Ah.

440
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,211
You are a true Targaryen.

441
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,255
Only, as you said a moment ago,

442
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,758
if we don't let you into the city,
you will all die.

443
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,551
And so...

444
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:42,431
Retreating in fear from a little girl
is unbecoming of the greatest city

445
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:43,974
that ever was or will be.

446
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:47,645
The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos.

447
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,480
The Thirteen have spoken.

448
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,732
I am one of the Thirteen,

449
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,901
and I am still speaking.

450
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,238
The girl threatens
to burn our city to the ground

451
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:00,241
and you would invite her in for a cup of wine?

452
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,576
She is the Mother of Dragons.

453
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:07,915
Do you expect her to watch her people starve
without breathing fire?

454
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,709
I believe we can allow a few Dothraki

455
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:13,337
through our gates without dooming our city.

456
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,464
After all, here I am,

457
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:20,427
a savage from the Summer lsles,
and Qarth still stands.

458
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,013
Our decision is final.

459
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,266
Very well.

460
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,854
I invoke soumai.

461
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:39,947
I will vouch for her, her people,
and her dragons, in accordance with the law.

462
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,289
Be it on your head.

463
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:52,459
Welcome to Qarth, my lady.

464
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:43,427
You.

465
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,648
Is there gold or silver
in the village?

466
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:59,109
- I'm not from the village.
- Where is the Brotherhood?

467
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:00,903
I don't know what that is.

468
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:34,395
You two.
Take Lord Lannister's things to his quarters.

469
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,271
What's this?

470
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:39,650
We weren't expecting you
till tomorrow, Lord Tywin.

471
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,735
Evidently not.

472
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:45,489
Why are these prisoners not in their cells?

473
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,908
Cells are overflowing, my lord.

474
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,120
This lot won't be here long.
Don't need no permanent place.

475
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,999
After we interrogate 'em, we usually just...

476
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:59,837
Are we so well-manned
that we can afford to discard

477
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,006
able young bodies and skilled laborers?

478
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:14,268
You, do you have a trade?

479
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,104
Smith, my lord.

480
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,941
What are you looking at? Kneel!

481
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:25,779
Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy.

482
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,157
He'll do no such thing.

483
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,493
This one's a girl, you idiot,

484
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:33,620
dressed as a boy.

485
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:36,457
- Why?
- Safer to travel, my lord.

486
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,542
Smart.

487
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,586
More than I can say for this lot.

488
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:43,630
Get these prisoners to work.

489
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:44,965
Bring the girl.

490
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,426
I need a new cupbearer.

491
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:48,969
My lord.

492
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,479
Your visits are too few, cousin.

493
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,064
Her Grace, the Queen Regent,

494
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,524
commands you to release
Grand Maester Pycelle.

495
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,985
- Here's your warrant.
- So it is.

496
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:08,155
Will you take a cup with me?

497
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:11,158
I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.

498
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:14,495
I am here at Her Grace's behest,
not to drink with you, lmp.

499
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:18,332
If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle,

500
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,000
I would have thought she'd come herself.

501
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:23,587
Instead she sends you.
What am I to make of that?

502
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,422
I don't care what you make of it,

503
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:28,175
so long as you release
your prisoner immediately.

504
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:32,012
And you've received
these instructions directly from Cersei?

505
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:34,306
As I said several times.

506
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,184
And you've waited this long
to deliver the information?

507
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,604
When the Queen Regent gives me a command,
I carry it out without delay.

508
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,360
Cersei must have great trust in you,

509
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:51,031
allowing you into her chamber
during the hour of the wolf.

510
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,330
The Queen Regent has
a great many responsibilities.

511
00:40:58,414 --> 00:40:59,915
She often works from dusk till dawn.

512
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:04,211
She must be very glad to have you helping her
from dusk till dawn.

513
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:06,964
Ah.

514
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:08,173
Lavender oil.

515
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:10,676
She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl.

516
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,261
I am a knight!

517
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,930
An anointed knight, yes.

518
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:19,893
Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted
before or after she took you into her bed?

519
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:23,564
What? Nothing to say?

520
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:25,774
No more warnings for me, ser?

521
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:27,568
You will withdraw these filthy accusations.

522
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:31,238
Have you ever given any thought
to what King Joffrey will have to say

523
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,408
when he finds out
you've been bedding his mother?

524
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:39,997
It's not my fault!

525
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:42,666
Did she take you against your will?

526
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,751
Can you not defend yourself, knight?

527
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:48,088
Your own father, Lord Tywin,
when I was named the King's squire,

528
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:50,215
he told me to obey her in everything.

529
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,176
Did he tell you to fuck her, too?

530
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,262
I only meant I did as I was bid.

531
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,014
Hated every moment of it,

532
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:58,849
is that what you'll have me believe?

533
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,185
A high place in court, a knighthood,

534
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,520
my sister's legs spreading
open for you at night.

535
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:05,772
Oh, yes, it must have been terrible.

536
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,774
Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this.

537
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:11,904
- Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you.
- Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.

538
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,573
My lord, it was your sister's bidding,
the Queen.

539
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,366
I'll leave the city at once, I swear.

540
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:19,620
- No, I think not.
- My lord?

541
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,496
You heard me.

542
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,629
My father told you to obey my sister.
Obey her.

543
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:31,381
Stay close to her side. Keep her trust.

544
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,967
Pleasure her whenever she requires.

545
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:38,513
No one ever need know,
as long as you keep faith with me.

546
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,726
I want to know what Cersei is doing,

547
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:47,731
where she goes, who she sees,
what they talk of, everything.

548
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,150
And you will tell me.

549
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,653
Yes, my lord, I will.

550
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,738
I swear it, as you command.

551
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,160
Oh, rise, rise.

552
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,622
Let us drink to our understanding.

553
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:06,250
Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well.

554
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:11,046
Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman,
and it's all for the good of the realm.

555
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,632
Go back and tell her
that I beg her forgiveness,

556
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,759
that I want no more conflict between us

557
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:19,471
and that, henceforth,
I shall do nothing without her consent.

558
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:20,806
But her demands?

559
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,475
Oh, I'll give her Pycelle.

560
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:26,186
- You will?
- Yes, I'll release him in the morning.

561
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:29,815
Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants,
but I will not have him on the Council.

562
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:32,734
I could swear that I had not harmed
a single hair on his head,

563
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:36,029
but that would not, strictly speaking, be true.

564
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:50,127
Stay within one table length.

565
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,717
Your Grace.

566
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,558
Do your knucklebones bring you luck?

567
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:10,731
Well, life's been good
since you hacked them off, Your Grace.

568
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:12,941
And it's four less fingernails to clean.

569
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:14,943
- Fewer.
- Pardon?

570
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:18,196
Four fewer fingernails to clean.

571
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,867
Never understood why you had to wear them.

572
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:25,746
It reminds me of where I come from
and where I am now.

573
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:27,789
It reminds me of yourjustice.

574
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,542
It was an honest punishment
and you were good with the cleaver.

575
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,919
You were a hero and a smuggler.

576
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:38,592
A good act does not wash out the bad,
nor a bad the good.

577
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,471
A lesson I've tried to teach my son.

578
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:44,639
- Does he listen?
- To me?

579
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:45,974
Gods, no.

580
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:49,936
But if your red woman
told him to leap from the crow's nest...

581
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,730
She has a name.

582
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:57,986
I trust you've not forgotten
your smuggler's tricks.

583
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:02,157
I've lived within the law for 17...

584
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,451
I want you to be a smuggler this time.

585
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,037
Any shore, any night.

586
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:08,997
What am I bringing ashore?

587
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:10,582
The red woman.

588
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:16,296
No one must know what you do
and we'll not speak of this again.

589
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:19,466
I am true to Your Grace and always will be,

590
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:22,677
but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways.

591
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,472
Cleaner ways don't win wars.

592
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,504
Are you afraid, Onion Knight?

593
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:04,094
Someone once told me
the night is dark and full of terrors.

594
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,557
You've carried
more unpleasant cargo in your time.

595
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,564
Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?

596
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:19,025
I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady,
good and bad.

597
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:22,821
If half an onion is black with rot,
it's a rotten onion.

598
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:26,199
A man is good or he is evil.

599
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:28,160
- And which are you?
- Oh, good.

600
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:34,374
I'm a knight myself, of sorts,
a champion of light and life.

601
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:38,170
Well, that must be very nice for you.

602
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:57,439
- Do you love your wife?
- I do.

603
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:00,358
Yet you have known other women.

604
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:02,194
Don't talk about my wife.

605
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:04,946
I'm not. I'm talking about other women.

606
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:08,366
Like me, Ser Davos.

607
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,498
You want me.

608
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,501
You want to see what's beneath this robe.

609
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,713
And you will.

610
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:31,056
Strange that this Lord of Light
asks you to work in the shadows.

611
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:35,435
Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos.

612
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:39,606
They are servants of light, the children of fire.

613
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:43,944
And the brighter the flame,
the darker they are.

614
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:46,571
These weren't here before.
They've barred the passage.

615
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:50,408
They can't bar our passage.

616
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,165
Gods protect us.

617
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,876
There's only one god, Ser Davos,

618
00:48:01,254 --> 00:48:03,547
and he only protects those who serve him.

1
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,089
- You swear it?
- By the mother.

2
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,552
My son has no interest in the lron Throne.

3
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:25,228
Then I see no reason for hostility between us.

4
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,731
Your son can go on
calling himself King in the North.

5
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:32,235
The Starks will have dominion
over all lands north of Moat Cailin,

6
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,195
provided he swears me an oath of fealty.

7
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,363
And the wording of this oath?

8
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:38,074
The same Ned Stark swore
to Robert 18 years ago.

9
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,871
Cat, their friendship held
the kingdoms together.

10
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:51,254
And in return for my son's loyalty?

11
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,757
In the morning, I'll destroy my brother's army.

12
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,092
When that's done,

13
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:00,555
Baratheon and Stark will fight
their common enemy together,

14
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,306
as they have done many times before.

15
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,649
Our two houses have always been close,

16
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:16,028
which is why I am begging you
to reconsider this battle.

17
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,530
Negotiate a peace with your brother.

18
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,782
Negotiate with Stannis?

19
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,076
You heard him out there.

20
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,037
I'd have better luck debating the wind.

21
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,958
Please bring my terms to your son.

22
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,919
I believe we are natural allies.

23
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:33,337
I hope he feels the same.

24
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,382
Together we could end this war in a fortnight.

25
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,231
No!

26
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,486
No.

27
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,863
Follow me!

28
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:05,244
- You'll die for this.
- No, wait, it wasn't her!

29
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,206
We've got to leave.

30
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,669
They'll hang you for this.

31
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,463
Now.

32
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,675
I won't leave him.

33
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,929
You can't avenge him if you're dead.

34
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,349
Over there, go!

35
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,142
Not that way.

36
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,762
We need to go home.

37
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,849
- Loras.
- My lord, my lady.

38
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,434
Get out.

39
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,602
Stannis will be here in an hour.

40
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,105
When he arrives,
Renly's bannermen will flock to him.

41
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,691
Your former companions
will fight for the privilege

42
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,193
of selling you to their new king.

43
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,945
And you want that privilege for yourself.

44
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,656
You will note that I am standing here
talking to you,

45
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,533
not Stannis.

46
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,868
There's no time for this.

47
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,536
Ride back to Highgarden, sister.

48
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,246
I'm not running from Stannis.

49
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,789
Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.

50
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:14,915
I don't believe that.

51
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,626
You don't believe that.

52
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,297
Who gained the most from our king's death?

53
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,049
Stannis.

54
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,051
I will put a sword through his righteous face.

55
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,886
You can't stay here.

56
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,972
He would have been a true king,

57
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,725
a good king.

58
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,143
Tell me, Ser Loras,

59
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,771
what do you desire most in this world?

60
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:38,939
Revenge.

61
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,484
I have always found that
to be the purest of motivations,

62
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,904
but you won't have a chance
to put your sword through Stannis,

63
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,739
not today.

64
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,824
You'll be cut to pieces
before he sets foot on solid ground.

65
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,536
If it is justice that you want, be smart about it.

66
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,164
You can't avenge him from the grave.

67
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,918
Bring the horses.

68
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,880
Please.

69
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,036
He was very handsome.

70
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,746
He was, Your Grace.

71
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,915
"Your Grace."

72
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,169
Calling yourself king doesn't make you one.

73
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:45,297
And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen.

74
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,634
Do you want to be a queen?

75
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,927
No.

76
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,557
I want to be the queen.

77
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,654
Killed? By whom?

78
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,156
Accounts differ.

79
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,992
Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark
in some way.

80
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,743
Really? Who'd have thought?

81
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,163
Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard,

82
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,832
while still others say
it was Stannis himself who did it

83
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,084
after negotiations went sour.

84
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,003
Whomever did it, I say well done.

85
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,421
It's not what Varys says.

86
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:28,132
He says Renly's army
is flocking to support Stannis,

87
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,844
which would give Stannis superiority
over us on both land and sea.

88
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,263
Littlefinger says we can
outspend him three to one.

89
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,391
And I say Father raised you
to have too much respect for money.

90
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:41,145
Stannis Baratheon is coming for us,
sooner rather than later.

91
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,438
Aren't there other things
you should be doing,

92
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,940
like sealing my daughter in a crate
so you can ship her away?

93
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,108
She'll be safer in Dorne.

94
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,194
Yes, I know how concerned you are
for her safety.

95
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,070
It so happens that I am.

96
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,449
Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl
and I don't blame her at all for you.

97
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,118
So clever.

98
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:01,081
Aren't you always so clever
with your schemes and your plots?

99
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,959
Schemes and plots are the same thing.

100
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,212
They are going to attack us.

101
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:07,755
We need to be ready.

102
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,090
No need to concern yourself over it.

103
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:13,886
The king is taking personal charge
of siege preparations.

104
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,181
May I ask specifically
what the king has in mind?

105
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,683
You may, specifically,
or you may ask vaguely.

106
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,810
The answer will be the same.

107
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:29,818
It's important that we talk about this.

108
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,616
It's the king's royal prerogative

109
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,245
to withhold sensitive information
from his councilors.

110
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,005
It's wildfire.

111
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,590
Wildfire?

112
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,678
You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?

113
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,597
- No.
- That's a lie right there.

114
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,808
It is not a lie. Why would I lie?

115
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,602
Tell me,

116
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:07,356
if the vile allegations
against my brother and sister are true,

117
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:11,110
do you think it will make Jaime
more likely to kill you or less likely?

118
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,072
When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean.

119
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,782
I'm telling you the truth.

120
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,325
The smart money would be on more likely.

121
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,618
She's making wildfire.

122
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:22,496
But then perhaps his own unnatural urges
will give him sympathy for yours.

123
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,164
The Alchemists' Guild
is being commissioned.

124
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,666
I suppose there's only one way to find out.

125
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,502
They have thousands of pots
already stored in their vaults.

126
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,462
They are planning to launch it
from the city walls

127
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,339
into Stannis' ships and armies.

128
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,174
Please.

129
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,720
When did she tell you this?

130
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,432
I heard her talking with the pyromancer.

131
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:46,937
And the other night, after I left her,
she went to meet him.

132
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,023
I swear to you.

133
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,524
Swear to me on what?

134
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:51,775
On my life.

135
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,319
But I don't care about your life.

136
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,323
In the light of the Seven,
by all that is holy and right,

137
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,867
I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow...

138
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:03,620
All right, all right. Enough.
Even torturing you is boring.

139
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,456
Just get out.

140
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,003
Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn

141
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,881
to please kill you
if anything should happen to me.

142
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,925
Please kill me if anything
should happen to Lord Tyrion.

143
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,138
It will be my pleasure.

144
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,186
Your Grace.

145
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,937
What is it?

146
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,231
I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace.

147
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,859
I wanted to let you know
that people grieve for him.

148
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,028
Fools love a fool.

149
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:40,074
I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was,
not the man he grew to be.

150
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,450
I need to speak to you

151
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,535
- about what I saw in that cave.
- I thought I made it clear to you

152
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,953
there'd be no need to speak to me
on this matter.

153
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,038
Your Grace, I...

154
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,457
I've never known you to need
to hear a thing twice.

155
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,127
And I've never known you
to hide from the truth.

156
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,629
You've come to lecture me on truth?

157
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,047
I've come to tell you that what I saw...

158
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,299
All my brother's bannermen
have come to my side.

159
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,471
Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards.

160
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,515
They won't be able to resist us now.

161
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,225
Soon I shall be sitting on the lron Throne.

162
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,727
Nothing is worth what this will cost you,
not even the lron...

163
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,437
I'll hear no more about it.

164
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,864
Take a company of men,
secure the perimeter.

165
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,909
When do we sail for King's Landing?

166
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,245
As soon as I've consolidated my troops.

167
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,205
We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet.

168
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,499
Once Blackwater Bay is cleared,

169
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,752
we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep
and take the city.

170
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,880
And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?

171
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,175
That's not your concern.

172
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,804
If you take King's Landing
with her by your side, the victory will be hers.

173
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,140
I never thought I'd have reason
to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?

174
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,851
Loyal service means telling hard truths.

175
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,186
Oh, truth again.

176
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,689
All right, what's the truth?

177
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,567
The hard truth?

178
00:12:56,651 --> 00:13:00,446
She's a foreigner
preaching her foreign religion.

179
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,575
Some believe she whispers orders in your ear
and you obey.

180
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,371
What do you believe?

181
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,919
You won those bannermen from Renly.

182
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,547
Don't lose them to her.

183
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,305
We set out for King's Landing
without Lady Melisandre.

184
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,851
And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.

185
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,813
Your Grace, I'm honored,
but my time on the sea

186
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,483
was spent evading ships, not attacking them.

187
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,151
The other lords won't be happy.

188
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,237
Most of those lords
should consider themselves lucky

189
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,573
I don't hang them for treason.

190
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:49,745
Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos.

191
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,723
I've got it! I've got it!

192
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,059
So it's that one there at the top,
on the right.

193
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:16,563
Buy my fruit, my lord. Fresh fruit.

194
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:20,150
Stannis has more infantry,
more ships, more horses.

195
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,735
What do we have?

196
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,446
There's that mind of yours
you keep going on about.

197
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,991
Well, I've never actually been able
to kill people with it.

198
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,452
Good thing. I'd be out of a job.

199
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,621
What about your father?

200
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,249
He hasn't sent a raven in weeks.

201
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,918
He's very busy.

202
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,922
Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark
is time-consuming.

203
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,216
We won't be able to
hold the city against Stannis,

204
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,801
not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it.

205
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,095
- Corruption.
- Yes!

206
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:52,641
We are swollen, bloated, foul.

207
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,019
Brother fornicates with sister
in the bed of kings

208
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:59,439
and we're surprised
when the fruit of their incest is rotten?

209
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:03,485
Yes, a rotten king.

210
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,446
It's hard to argue with his assessment.

211
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,740
Not after what he did to your birthday present.

212
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,660
The king is a lost cause.

213
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,079
It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.

214
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,833
A dancing king,
prancing down his bloodstained halls

215
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,503
to the tune of a twisted demon monkey.

216
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,674
You have to admire his imagination.

217
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,676
He's talking about you.

218
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,929
What? Demon monkey?

219
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,348
People think you're pulling the king's strings.

220
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,559
They blame you for the city's ills.

221
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,936
Blame me? I'm trying to save them.

222
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,272
You don't need to convince me.

223
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,525
Demon monkey.

224
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,765
Yeah, come on.

225
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,224
You're the crew of the Sea Bitch?

226
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,770
I'm your commander. Welcome.

227
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,607
Stop.

228
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,901
Stop!

229
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,154
Your captain commands you to stop!

230
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,282
Where are we headed, Captain?

231
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,329
The Stony Shore, to raid their villages.

232
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,874
There'll be spoils in it for you, and women,
if you do yourjobs well.

233
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,086
And who decides if we've done our jobs well?

234
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,255
I do.

235
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,424
Your captain.

236
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:57,599
I have been reaving and raping
since before you left Balon's balls, Captain.

237
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:02,604
Don't reckon I've got much use
for your ideas on how to do it.

238
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,899
Don't reckon I've got much use
for a captain at all.

239
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,986
I'm thinking I can do the job of captain
real well myself.

240
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,239
All I need is a ship.

241
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:17,119
You wouldn't know where I could
find myself a ship now, would you?

242
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:24,918
You could do that,
take the ship, head out on your own.

243
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:28,839
And I will hunt you down, drag you back here
in chains and hang you for a traitor.

244
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,466
Stop. We yield.

245
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,973
Congratulations on your first command.

246
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,684
Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.

247
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,977
Oh, I'm not here for you.

248
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,397
I was just on my way to Red Harbor.

249
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:49,109
I've got 30 ships.
There's nowhere to put them here.

250
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,736
Too narrow.

251
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,114
You'd better get out there.
Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.

252
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,408
That would never happen.

253
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,953
My crew would wait on deck
for a year if I asked them to.

254
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,372
This lot, though...

255
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,209
Enjoy the Stony Shore.

256
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,675
Come on, I'll take you out.

257
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,761
Who are you?

258
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,846
Dagmer, your first mate.

259
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,266
Why aren't you with the rest of them?

260
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,103
Or did they send you to row me out
and dump me halfway in the sea?

261
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:26,480
That would be good for a laugh.

262
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,608
They're not gonna respect you
until you prove yourself.

263
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,861
And how am I supposed to prove myself
by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?

264
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,362
You're not.

265
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:40,202
And yet that's the task my father has given me
to prove that I'm a true lron islander.

266
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,996
They're all lron islanders.

267
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:46,625
Do they do as they're told
or do they do as they like?

268
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:56,843
The Stony Shore's not far
from Torrhen's Square.

269
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,262
The seat of the House of Tallhart,

270
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,890
***

271
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:06,770
- What, you don't think we could take it?
- No, we could.

272
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,939
We could never hold it
for more than a few days.

273
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,316
As soon as Winterfell got word
that we'd taken Torrhen's Square,

274
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,444
the Starks would send their men
to take it back.

275
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:16,279
And then...

276
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,330
Take me to my ship.

277
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,004
The Starks have overextended their lines.

278
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,923
Now that summer's over,
they'll have a hard time

279
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,842
keeping their men and horses fed.

280
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,010
The Starks understand winter
better than we ever will.

281
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,929
The cold won't beat them.

282
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:45,725
Our spies report growing discontent
among the Northern lords.

283
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:50,272
They want to return home
and gather the harvest before the crops turn.

284
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,108
And I'm sure if those same spies
snuck into our own encampments,

285
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,152
they would report growing discontent
amongst the Southern lords.

286
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,780
This is war, no one's content.

287
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,327
We've underestimated
the Stark boy for too long.

288
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,956
He has a good mind for warfare,
his men worship him.

289
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,627
And as long as he keeps winning battles,
they'll keep believing he is King in the North.

290
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,213
You've been waiting for him to fail.

291
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:19,259
He is not going to fail, not without our help.

292
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,848
So how do we stop him?

293
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,766
We've worked
through the night, my lord.

294
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,644
Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep.

295
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,688
Yes, I think you would, Reginald.

296
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:35,483
And because you're my cousin,
I might even let you wake from that sleep.

297
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,112
Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you.

298
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,031
My wife's in Lannisport.

299
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:43,158
Well, then you'd better start riding.

300
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,996
Go, before I change my mind
and send her your head.

301
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,123
If your name wasn't Lannister,

302
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,835
you'd be scrubbing out pots
in the cook's tent. Go!

303
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,840
Not wine, water.

304
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:00,842
We'll be here for some time.

305
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,140
Girl.

306
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,644
Where are you from?

307
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,520
Maidenpool, my lord.

308
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:17,067
And who are the Lords of Maidenpool?
Remind me.

309
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:19,945
House Mooton, my lord.

310
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,738
And what is their sigil?

311
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,119
A red salmon.

312
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,872
I think a Maidenpool girl
would remember that.

313
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,042
You're a Northerner, aren't you?

314
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,380
Good. One more time, where are you from?

315
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,632
Barrowton, my lord.

316
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,592
House Dustin.

317
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:45,345
Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown.

318
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:50,934
And what do they say
of Robb Stark in the North?

319
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,439
They call him the Young Wolf.

320
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:57,816
And?

321
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,194
They say he rides into battle
on the back of a giant direwolf.

322
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,534
They say he can turn into
a wolf himself when he wants.

323
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,577
They say he can't be killed.

324
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,539
And do you believe them?

325
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,583
No, my lord.

326
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,712
Anyone can be killed.

327
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,929
Fetch that water.

328
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,680
A girl says nothing.

329
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:16,061
A girl keeps her mouth closed.

330
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:22,150
No one hears,
and friends may talk in secret, yes?

331
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,448
A boy becomes a girl.

332
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,991
I was always a girl.

333
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,160
And I was always aware.

334
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:34,954
But the girl keeps secrets.

335
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,291
It is not for a man to spoil them.

336
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,586
You're one of them now.

337
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,466
I should have let you burn.

338
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,554
And you fetch water for one of them now.

339
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:55,350
Why is this right for you and wrong for me?

340
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,770
- I didn't have a choice.
- You did.

341
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:00,814
I did.

342
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,399
And here we are.

343
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,154
A man pays his debts.

344
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,365
A man owes three.

345
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,825
Three what?

346
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:16,204
The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl.

347
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:19,415
And only death may pay for life.

348
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,086
You saved me and the two I was with.

349
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,214
You stole three deaths from the Red God.

350
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,553
We have to give them back.

351
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,933
Speak three names

352
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,936
and the man will do the rest.

353
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,481
Three lives I will give you,

354
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:45,275
no more, no less,

355
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,651
and we're done.

356
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,820
I can name anyone

357
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,531
and you'll kill him?

358
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:54,409
A man has said.

359
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:58,913
The one who tortures everyone.

360
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,748
A man needs a name.

361
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,750
I don't know his name.

362
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:04,669
They call him the Tickler.

363
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,421
That is enough.

364
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,633
Go now, girl. Your master is thirsty.

365
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,024
He's not here yet.

366
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:28,735
He'd have seen us, blown the horn.

367
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,320
When will he come?

368
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:33,072
The Half hand does things in his own time.

369
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,533
My uncle told me stories about him.

370
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:37,035
Most of them are true.

371
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:40,413
I heard the Half hand
spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.

372
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,706
The whole winter.

373
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,250
He was north of the Skirling Pass
when the snows came.

374
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:46,211
Had to wait for the thaw.

375
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:49,964
So it is possible for someone
to survive out here on their own.

376
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,259
Well, possible for the Half hand.

377
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:55,136
Beautiful, isn't it?

378
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,722
Gilly would love it here.

379
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:01,559
There's nothing more sickening
than a man in love.

380
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:31,172
About time you did something.

381
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,675
At least you'll keep warm.

382
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:38,012
The Fist of the First Men.

383
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:41,349
Think of how old this place is.

384
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,560
Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals,

385
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:47,105
before the Andals took Westeros
from the First Men.

386
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:49,899
Before I die, please, stop talking.

387
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:55,780
Thousands and thousands of years ago,
the First Men stood here where we're standing

388
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,991
all through the long night.

389
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,829
What do you think they were like,
the First Men?

390
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:04,247
Stupid.

391
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,417
Smart people don't find themselves
in places like this.

392
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,627
I think they were afraid.

393
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:14,048
I think they came here
to get away from something.

394
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,552
And I don't think it worked.

395
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:22,807
Wildlings?

396
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,812
One blast is for rangers returning.

397
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,522
Wildlings is two blasts.

398
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:32,984
So you got to stand there waiting,

399
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,111
wondering.

400
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,696
One blast for friends,

401
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,657
two for foes.

402
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,536
And three for White Walkers.

403
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,709
It's been a thousand years,

404
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,503
but that's the only time
they blow the horn three times.

405
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,797
But if it's been a thousand years,
how do you know?

406
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,468
- Well...
- I read it in a book.

407
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,553
Look.

408
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:04,265
It's Qhorin Half hand.

409
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,143
Aye, we'll live another day.

410
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,604
Hurrah.

411
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,783
Take care, my lord.

412
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:24,994
I remember reading an old sailors' proverb,

413
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:27,997
"Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off."

414
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:31,626
Oh, I have not conducted this experiment.

415
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,170
It could well be true.

416
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:39,300
The substance burns so hot,
it melts wood, stone, even steel,

417
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,803
and, of course, flesh.

418
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:47,141
The substance burns so hot,
it melts flesh like tallow.

419
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:55,858
After the dragons died, wildfire was the key
to the Targaryen power.

420
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,028
My companion takes issue.

421
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:03,616
If I could tell you how many crazy old men
I've seen pushing carts around army camps

422
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,285
making grand claims
about jars full of pig shit.

423
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:10,665
- No offense meant.
- Our order does not deal in pig shit.

424
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,084
The substance is fire given form.

425
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:16,504
And we have been perfecting it
since the days of Maegor.

426
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,630
To do what?

427
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:21,384
The jars are put in catapults
and flung at the enemy.

428
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,011
How much do you have?

429
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:31,102
If you could get real soldiers
to man the catapults,

430
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,689
then maybe you'd hit
your target one time in ten,

431
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,859
but all the real soldiers
are in the Riverlands with your father.

432
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,944
My lord, this man is insulting.

433
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,155
I don't know if you've ever seen a battle,
old man,

434
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,781
but things can get a bit messy.

435
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:47,368
'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis,
he's flinging them right back at us.

436
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,413
Men die, men shit themselves, men run,

437
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,165
which means pots falling,

438
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:54,000
which means fire inside the walls,

439
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:58,838
which means the poor cunts trying to defend
the city end up burning it down.

440
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:00,923
My friend remains unconvinced.

441
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:05,094
He would not dare insult my order
whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.

442
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:07,597
Well, he's not living anymore.

443
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:10,725
And all his pots of wildfire
didn't help him, did they?

444
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:14,395
Men win wars, not magic tricks.

445
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:34,499
We have been working tirelessly,
day and night,

446
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:39,003
ever since your royal sister
commanded us to do so.

447
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:44,383
Our present count stands at 7,811.

448
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:50,181
Enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet
and armies both.

449
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,225
This is a shit idea.

450
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:56,521
I'm afraid I have to concur
with my advisor, Wisdom Hallyne.

451
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:01,192
The contents of this room
could lay King's Landing low.

452
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:06,113
You won't be making wildfire
for my sister any longer.

453
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,743
You'll be making it for me.

454
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:44,318
He'll be able to feed himself from now on.

455
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,157
Let him sleep, Doreah.

456
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,076
Yes, Khaleesi.

457
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,664
He loves you.

458
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:03,671
I rewove this part of the top.

459
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,758
And I fixed the heel on this one.

460
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,677
Thank you, my friend.

461
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:14,849
Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you?

462
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,311
They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth.

463
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,562
It is known.

464
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:23,774
And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos...

465
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:27,862
The last time a rich man gave me a dress,
he was selling me to Khal Drogo.

466
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:31,532
May he ride forever through the night lands.

467
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:37,371
Xaro is our host,
but we know nothing about him.

468
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:42,251
Men like to talk about other men
when they're happy.

469
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,261
You would look like a real princess
in Xaro's...

470
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:55,056
She's not a princess. She's a Khaleesi.

471
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,731
You should wear it, Khaleesi.

472
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,901
You are their guest. it would be rude not to.

473
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:30,925
And you must visit the night market.

474
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:34,804
The Qartheen night market
is like no night market you've ever seen.

475
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:36,681
It sounds wonderful.

476
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:39,058
The Meereenis think they have a night market.

477
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,352
I will take you there myself.

478
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,604
Please excuse me for a moment.

479
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,193
What are they doing?

480
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,612
Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry.

481
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:54,407
Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot.

482
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,201
They can pry out the gems,
the rest is pure gold.

483
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,287
Very soft.
He can chop off as much as we can carry.

484
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,707
Or melt it. Very simple.

485
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,208
We are his guests!

486
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,128
You can't pry it or chop it or melt it.

487
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:08,796
Of course not, Khaleesi!

488
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,090
We will wait until we leave.

489
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,758
Not even when we leave.

490
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,677
Why not?

491
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,555
Our host saved us from the
Red Waste and you want to steal from him?

492
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,307
I will hear no more.

493
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,318
My brother used to say
the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do

494
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,571
was steal things better men have built.

495
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:35,072
It's not the only thing.

496
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:36,866
They're quite good at killing the better men.

497
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,452
That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.

498
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:41,412
Mother of Dragons.

499
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:46,417
On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth,
I welcome you.

500
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,296
A demonstration?

501
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:53,591
Take this gem.

502
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:55,468
Look at it.

503
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,512
Into its depths.

504
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,682
So many facets.

505
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:06,353
Look closely enough
and you can see yourself in them.

506
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,149
Often more than once.

507
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:17,406
Should you grow tired
of Xaro's baubles and trinkets,

508
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:20,618
it would be an honor
to host you at the House of the Undying.

509
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:24,705
You are always welcome, Mother of Dragons.

510
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,840
My apologies.

511
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,926
Pyat Pree is one of the Thirteen.

512
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:40,137
It was customary for me
to extend him an invitation.

513
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:43,182
Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.

514
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,726
What is the House of the Undying?

515
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:49,688
It is where the warlocks go
to squint at dusty books

516
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,148
and drink shade of the evening.

517
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:55,194
It turns their lips blue and their minds soft.

518
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:59,865
So soft, they actually believe
their parlor tricks are magic.

519
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,913
You watch over her.

520
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:09,917
Do I know you?

521
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,710
I know you.

522
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,588
Jorah Mormont of Bear island.

523
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:17,091
Who are you?

524
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,301
I'm no one.

525
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,512
But she is the Mother of Dragons.

526
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:25,182
She needs true protectors,
now more than ever.

527
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:30,020
They shall come day and night
to see the wonder born into the world again.

528
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:33,107
And when they see, they shall lust,

529
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:36,944
for dragons are fire made flesh.

530
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:39,446
And fire is power.

531
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,293
It looked like Stannis.

532
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,005
To me it just looked like...

533
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,635
A shadow in the shape of a man.

534
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,762
In the shape of Stannis.

535
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,395
We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.

536
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,397
Will you stay there long, my lady?

537
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,817
Only long enough
to tell Robb what I have seen.

538
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:20,321
After that, I will leave for Winterfell.

539
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,116
My two youngest need me.

540
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,619
I've been away from them for far too long.

541
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:29,330
I never knew my mother.

542
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,124
I'm sorry.

543
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:35,961
My own mother died on the birthing bed

544
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,464
when I was very young.

545
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,345
It's a bloody business.

546
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:48,349
What comes after is even harder.

547
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:52,937
Once you're safely back
amongst your own people,

548
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,981
will you give me leave to go, my lady?

549
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:58,150
You mean to kill Stannis.

550
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,069
I swore a vow.

551
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:03,447
But Stannis has a great army around him.

552
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,158
His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.

553
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,534
I'm as good as any of them.

554
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,663
I should never have fled.

555
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:14,208
Renly's death was no fault of yours.

556
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,251
You served him bravely.

557
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,546
I only held him that once

558
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:22,675
as he was dying.

559
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,137
He's gone, Brienne.

560
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:31,558
You serve nothing and no one
by following him into the earth.

561
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:35,813
Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well.

562
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,611
I do not know your son, my lady.

563
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,659
But I could serve you, if you would have me.

564
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:50,911
You have courage.

565
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,833
Not battle courage, perhaps,
but, I don't know,

566
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,420
a woman's kind of courage.

567
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:03,007
And I think that when the time comes,
you will not hold me back.

568
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:06,593
Promise me that you will not hold me back
from Stannis.

569
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:15,769
When the time comes,
I will not hold you back.

570
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,737
Then I am yours, my lady.

571
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:30,617
I will shield your back
and give my life for yours, if it comes to that.

572
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:33,912
I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.

573
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:45,132
I vow that you shall always
have a place in my home

574
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:46,633
and at my table

575
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:51,472
and that I shall ask no service of you
that might bring you dishonor.

576
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:55,309
I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.

577
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,148
And it's not just thieves, my lord.

578
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,776
There's wolves in them hills now,

579
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,028
more than I ever seen.

580
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:08,989
They come down in the night
and they kill my sheep.

581
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,910
My three sons is away
fighting for your brother, my lord.

582
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:16,455
They'll fight, keep fighting
till they're told to go home.

583
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:19,792
I have no one to man my flock now. Only me.

584
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:23,420
I can't keep watch all day and all night.

585
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,467
We can send two orphan boys
from Winterstown home with you

586
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,344
to help watch over your flock

587
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,012
if you can give them room and board.

588
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,140
My wife always prayed for more children.

589
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,601
We'll look after them. Thank you, my lord.

590
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,229
And may the gods bless you and yours.

591
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:44,358
Stop it.

592
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,987
If that's everyone,
I'm going to go for a ride before dark.

593
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:51,365
- Good.
- Hodor.

594
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,159
- Hodor.
- Ah! Lord Stark.

595
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:56,703
Torrhen's Square is under siege.

596
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,373
Torrhen's Square
is barely 40 leagues from here.

597
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:02,543
How can the Lannisters strike so far north?

598
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,462
Might be a raiding party led by the mountain.

599
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:07,548
Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.

600
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:08,799
We have to help them.

601
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:12,302
Most of the fighting men are away with Robb,
but I can gather 200 decent men.

602
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:13,637
Do you need so many?

603
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,515
If we can't protect our own bannermen,
why should they protect us?

604
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,561
Go, Ser Rodrik. Take the men you need.

605
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,772
Won't take long, my lord.
Southerners don't do well up here.

606
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,743
So, what does it mean?

607
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:40,330
Ask your Maester Luwin.
He's the one studying books all the time.

608
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:43,750
I did ask him.
He'd never heard of a three-eyed raven.

609
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,170
Must not mean anything, then.

610
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:47,296
You're lying.

611
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,257
You might be a little lord,
but don't you call me a liar.

612
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,260
- You know what it means.
- I never said I didn't.

613
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:55,262
You didn't give me an honest answer.

614
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:58,015
That's not the same as being a liar.

615
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:59,725
Well, it's not far off.

616
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:03,270
So, you've been dreaming
of a three-eyed raven again?

617
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:08,984
In the godswood,
you told me you didn't dream.

618
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:10,694
Now who's a liar?

619
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,491
What did you see in your dream?

620
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:20,913
Something bad?

621
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:23,624
Tell me, boy.

622
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,630
I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell.

623
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,800
I saw waves crashing against the gates

624
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,638
and the water came flowing over the walls...

625
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:42,267
it flooded the castle.

626
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:47,022
Drowned men were floating here,

627
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,107
in the yard.

628
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,946
Ser Rodrik was one of them.

629
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:59,368
The sea is hundreds of miles away.

630
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:00,661
I know.

631
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:04,122
- It's just a stupid dream.
- I've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen.

632
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:06,250
Otherwise they'll put me in chains again.

633
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:07,918
Osha.

634
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,503
The three-eyed raven,

635
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:14,174
what do they say about it north of the Wall?

636
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:19,680
They say all sorts of crazy things
north of the Wall.

637
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:33,110
- There.
- Where?

638
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:34,861
On that mountain.

639
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:37,447
I don't see very well.

640
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:38,573
A fire.

641
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,370
There's a fire.

642
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:47,082
The people sitting around it
have better eyes than yours or mine.

643
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,711
When they see us coming,
that fire becomes a signal.

644
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:54,381
Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time
to throw a party in our honor.

645
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,466
How many wildlings have joined him?

646
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:59,553
From what we can tell, all of them.

647
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,477
Mance has gathered them all
like deer against the wolves.

648
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,229
They're almost ready to make their move.

649
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:13,066
- Where?
- Somewhere safe.

650
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:14,860
Somewhere south.

651
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,571
Can't just march into their midst.

652
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:21,491
And we can't wait for them here with nothing
but a pile of stones to protect us.

653
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:24,578
You saying we should fall back to the Wall?

654
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,831
Mance was one of us once.

655
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,584
Now he's one of them.

656
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:33,587
He's going to teach them
our way of doing things.

657
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:37,507
They'll hit us in force
and they won't run away when we hit back.

658
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:41,845
They're gonna be more organized than before,
more disciplined,

659
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:43,972
more like us.

660
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:48,268
So we need to be more like them,
do things their way.

661
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,688
Sneak in, kill Mance,

662
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:55,567
and scatter them to the winds
before they can march on the Wall.

663
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:58,779
- And to do that...
- We need to get rid of those lookouts.

664
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:01,198
It's not a job for 400 men.

665
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:03,950
I need to move fast and silent.

666
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:08,163
Harker, Stonesnake, Borba.

667
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:11,375
Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin.

668
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:16,338
I've been called lots of things,
but that might be my first Lord Qhorin.

669
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,883
You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger.

670
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,676
I've fought and killed a wight.

671
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:23,678
How many rangers can say that?

672
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:25,097
He's the one?

673
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,184
Aye. You killed a wight.

674
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:33,772
You also let an old man beat you bloody
and take your sword.

675
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,691
Craster?

676
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:39,152
In the boy's defense, that's a tough old goat.

677
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,158
I could take up Jon's duties
while he's gone, my lord.

678
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,453
It would be no trouble.

679
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:01,466
Well, I hope you make a better ranger
than you do a steward.

680
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:04,886
Go on.

681
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,312
So, tell me,

682
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:17,941
how long has your manservant
been in love with you?

683
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:21,611
He's not my manservant
and he's not in love with me.

684
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,363
He's my advisor,

685
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,157
my friend.

686
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:26,741
Unlikely.

687
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:29,744
I can almost always tell what a man wants.

688
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:32,038
And what about what a woman wants?

689
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:33,999
Much more complicated.

690
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:37,878
You, for example, what do you want?

691
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:41,715
To cross the Narrow Sea
and take back the lron Throne.

692
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,216
Why?

693
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,177
Because I promised my khalasar
I'd protect them

694
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:47,304
and find them a safe home.

695
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:50,599
You want to conquer
the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki?

696
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:52,809
I want them because they're mine by right.

697
00:46:53,186 --> 00:46:56,146
The lron Throne is mine and I will take it.

698
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:57,731
Ah, a conqueror.

699
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:01,067
And how did you get all of this?
Did someone give it to you?

700
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:05,906
No. I come from nothing.
I hit the docks like a piece of cargo,

701
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,158
except someone normally cares
what happens to cargo.

702
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,911
So you wanted more than you had
and you took it.

703
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,998
You're a conqueror, too.
You're just less ambitious.

704
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:22,339
What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos?

705
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:25,091
At the gates of the city, you bled for me.

706
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,259
Why?

707
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:30,430
I will show you why.

708
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:37,270
The door and the vault
is made of Valyrian stone.

709
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:41,191
The hardest steel does not make a mark.

710
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:46,613
I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth
their weight in gold if they could break into it.

711
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:49,533
I made the same offer to the greatest thieves.

712
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,035
They all went home empty-handed.

713
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,288
The only thing that can open this door

714
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,582
is this key.

715
00:47:57,959 --> 00:47:59,042
And behind the door?

716
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,548
And it can all be mine?

717
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:07,467
All? Let us say half.

718
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:14,099
More than enough
to buy horses, ships, armies...

719
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,017
Enough to go home.

720
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:18,895
All I have to do?

721
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:20,605
Is marry me.

722
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:24,067
That was a romantic proposal.

723
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:28,029
I've already married once for love,
but the gods stole her from me.

724
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,285
I come from nothing.

725
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:36,204
My mother and father
never owned a pair of shoes.

726
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,624
But marry me,
and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms

727
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:43,086
and our children
will be princes and princesses.

728
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:47,132
See?

729
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:49,926
I have more ambition than you thought.

730
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:55,098
The time is right,
Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name.

731
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:58,059
Robert Baratheon is dead.

732
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:07,360
If you cross the sea
with an army you bought...

733
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:09,779
The Seven Kingdoms
are at war with one another.

734
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,365
Four false kings destroying the country.

735
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:15,118
To win Westeros,
you need support from Westeros.

736
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,495
The usurper is dead.

737
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:20,999
The Starks fight the Lannisters,
and Baratheons fight each other.

738
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:24,377
According to your new friend
who earned your trust by cutting his hand?

739
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:27,505
The time to strike is now.
We need to find ships and an army

740
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:30,216
or we'll spend the rest of our lives
rotting away at the edge of the world.

741
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:32,802
Rich men do not become rich
by giving more than they get.

742
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:35,930
They'll give you ships and soldiers
and they'll own you forever.

743
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:39,184
Moving carefully is the hard way,
but it's the right way.

744
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,519
And if I'd listened to that advice
outside the gates of Qarth,

745
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:43,229
we'd all be dead by now.

746
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:46,483
I know the opportunity before you
seems like the last you'll ever have,

747
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:50,070
- but you must...
- Do not speak to me like I'm a child.

748
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:54,407
- I only want...
- What do you want?

749
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:56,534
Tell me.

750
00:49:57,244 --> 00:50:00,246
- To see you on the lron Throne.
- Why?

751
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:01,623
You have a good claim.

752
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,917
A title. A birthright.

753
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,671
But you have something more than that.

754
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:12,217
You may cover it up and deny it,
but you have a gentle heart.

755
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:15,470
You would not only be respected and feared,
you would be loved.

756
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,432
Someone who can rule and should rule.

757
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:22,519
Centuries come and go without
a person like that coming into the world.

758
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:28,608
There are times when I look at you
and I still can't believe you're real.

759
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:43,915
So what would you have me do,
as my advisor?

760
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,381
Make your own way.

761
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:54,592
Find your own ship. You only need one.

762
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:57,470
The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth.

763
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,474
And how do I get the ship?

764
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:03,560
I'll find it for you.

765
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:06,312
A sound ship with a good captain.

766
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,279
I look forward to meeting him.

767
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:19,659
Khaleesi.

768
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:51,483
You should stand sideface.

769
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:52,567
Sideface?

770
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:56,070
Sideways.

771
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:57,447
Why?

772
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,365
Smaller target.

773
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,411
Am I fighting someone?

774
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:04,746
You're practicing for a fight.

775
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,374
You should practice right.

776
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,254
Guards!

777
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,467
Did you see anything?

778
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:22,388
Go up there. Go and see where he fell from.

779
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:28,728
Go up the battlement.

780
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,696
Move away.

781
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:42,909
Stand back. He's dead.

1
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,532
I've taken your castle.

2
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,577
- Theon?
- It's Prince Theon now.

3
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,996
Get up. You have to get dressed.

4
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,208
I've taken Winterfell.

5
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,585
I took it. I'm occupying it.

6
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,755
I sent men over the walls
with grappling claws and ropes.

7
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,675
- Why?
- To take the castle.

8
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,345
- You went with Robb.
- And he sent me back to Pyke.

9
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:04,225
I'm a Greyjoy.
I can't fight for Robb and my father both.

10
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,020
- Where's Hodor?
- I don't know.

11
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,231
Find the halfwit.

12
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:14,360
My men are bringing your people
together in the courtyard.

13
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,904
- Why?
- So you and I can go down and tell them

14
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,615
- how you've yielded Winterfell to me.
- I won't.

15
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,535
Yes, you will.

16
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,079
I won't. I'll never yield.

17
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,415
We'll fight you and throw you out.

18
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:35,047
The castle is mine.

19
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,258
But these people are still yours.

20
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,510
You'll yield to keep them safe,

21
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:41,304
to keep them alive.

22
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,223
That's what a good lord would do.

23
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,438
Think carefully about what you want to say.

24
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:54,775
Theon.

25
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,028
Did you hate us the whole time?

26
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,622
I've yielded Winterfell to Theon.

27
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:08,831
Louder.

28
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,000
Say Prince Theon.

29
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,086
I've yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon.

30
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:15,838
You all know me.

31
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:18,591
Aye, we know you for a steaming sack of shit.

32
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,343
Farlen, you be silent.

33
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,137
Listen to your little lord, Farlen.

34
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,306
He has more sense than you do.

35
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,475
All of you should do as he commands.

36
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:31,020
My father has donned
the ancient crown of Salt and Rock

37
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,440
and declared himself King of the lron islands.

38
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,027
He claims the North as well
by right of conquest.

39
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,613
- You are all his subjects.
- Bugger that.

40
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,531
I serve the Starks.

41
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,952
- If you think you can hold the North with it...
- Shut up!

42
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:49,497
If you serve me as loyally
as you served Ned Stark,

43
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,083
- I will be as good to you as he ever was.
- Steady.

44
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,293
Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't.

45
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,465
Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke

46
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,051
informing my father of my victory here.

47
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:04,720
And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister.

48
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,058
Inform her that she's to bring
500 men to Winterfell.

49
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,147
You are a maester of the Citadel,

50
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,192
sworn to serve the Lord of Winterfell,
are you not?

51
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:19,819
I am.

52
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,280
I am the Lord of Winterfell
as Bran just informed you.

53
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,742
Send the ravens.

54
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,663
My lord.

55
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,583
My Lord Greyjoy.

56
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:39,630
I see you've finally learned
how to address your betters.

57
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:41,674
What do you want?

58
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,843
I was brought here a captive.

59
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,262
You were here the day I was taken.

60
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,931
I'm the one who took you. What of it?

61
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,309
Let me serve you.

62
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,645
Serve me how?

63
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,273
I need fighters, not kitchen sluts.

64
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,109
It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens.

65
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,320
Put a spear in my hand again.

66
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,324
So you can bury it in my neck?
Do you take me for a fool?

67
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,035
Get up.

68
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:10,995
Step aside.

69
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,873
Why?

70
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,251
It's your dream, little lord.

71
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,671
The ocean has come to swallow this place.

72
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,214
I ain't letting it drown me.

73
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,716
You'll all go about
your tasks as usual.

74
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,302
- And in a few days' time...
- Greyjoy!

75
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,229
We caught this one on his way back
from Torrhen's Square.

76
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:40,024
Took out two of ours before I got his sword.

77
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,527
Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes.

78
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:47,198
It grieves me you've less honor
than a back alley whore.

79
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,326
You were raised here under this roof.

80
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,412
- These people are your people.
- They are not my people.

81
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,623
King Robb thought of you as a brother.

82
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,626
My brothers are dead.

83
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,796
They died fighting Stark men, men like you.

84
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,091
Aye, they died fighting a war
your father started.

85
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,259
Lord Stark raised you among his own sons.

86
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,595
Among them, but not one of them.

87
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,389
I was his hostage, taken from my home.

88
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:13,724
If he were alive to see this...

89
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,643
He's not. He's dead.

90
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,479
The Seven Kingdoms are at war.

91
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,231
And Winterfell is mine.

92
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:24,485
I should have put a sword in your belly
instead of in your hand.

93
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,780
You've served this house faithfully, old man.

94
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,615
But keep talking and I'll...

95
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,161
Take him to the cells. Lock him up...

96
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:35,579
My prince.

97
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,791
You cannot let that stand. He must pay.

98
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,751
I'll lock him in a cell until he rots.

99
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,796
No, he has to pay the iron price.

100
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,341
They'll never respect you while he lives.

101
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,236
Ser Rodrik,

102
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,779
I sentence you to death!

103
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,365
No! You said no harm
would come to them if I yielded.

104
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,576
The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut.

105
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,579
I urge you not to make a hasty decision.

106
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,331
He disrespected me
in front of my men.

107
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,083
That was his decision, not mine.

108
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,460
He is worth more to you alive than dead.

109
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,921
The Starks will pay.

110
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:31,093
Please, Theon, think what you do.

111
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,524
You'll address me as Prince Theon
or you'll be next.

112
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,110
Come.

113
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:49,945
No!

114
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,615
- No!
- Theon!

115
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:58,162
Rodrik!

116
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,665
He who passes the sentence
should swing the sword.

117
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,834
- I'm begging you.
- Coward.

118
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,378
Stop.

119
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,464
Stop! Stop right now!

120
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,176
You don't give commands anymore, little lord.

121
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,387
- Please, stop this. Please stop him.
- Hush now, child.

122
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,139
I'm off to see your father.

123
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,936
You said no harm would come!

124
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,439
You said no harm would come. Theon, please.

125
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,233
Any last words, old man?

126
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:31,487
Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy.

127
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,322
Now you are truly lost.

128
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,575
Theon, please don't. Do something!

129
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,994
I'll do anything, please!

130
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,412
No, please stop it!

131
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,196
Ghost, stay with us.

132
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,365
Ghost!

133
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,075
There goes your pet.

134
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,327
He's not a pet.

135
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,329
No, you're right, he's not.

136
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,081
You can't tame a wild thing.

137
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,834
You can't trust a wild thing.

138
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:29,503
- Ghost is different.
- So you think.

139
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,631
Wild creatures have their own rules,

140
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,508
their own reasons.

141
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,260
And you'll never know them.

142
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,347
Now the wildlings we're looking for

143
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,308
sleep during the day and hunt at night.

144
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,521
I thought you said
you couldn't know wild things.

145
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,231
I said you can't.

146
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,776
They find a nice cave to hide in
while the sun's up

147
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,486
and do their killing when it's dark.

148
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,196
We could do the same.

149
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,531
No, we couldn't.

150
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,950
This is their country.

151
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,828
They know where to walk, where not to walk.

152
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:06,707
I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse
they didn't see till they were in it.

153
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,836
My father always said I'm of the North.

154
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,257
- I wasn't joking.
- Look around, boy.

155
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,510
This look like home to you?

156
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:22,181
You start thinking you know this place,
it will kill you.

157
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,933
You understand me?

158
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,269
No, you don't.

159
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,396
We're at war.

160
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,440
We've always been at war.

161
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,068
It's never going to end
'cause we're not fighting an enemy.

162
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:37,613
We're fighting the North,
and it's not going anywhere.

163
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,449
The Watch has given you a great gift.

164
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,535
You only have one thing to give in return,

165
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,578
your life.

166
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,624
- I'll gladly give my life.
- I don't want you to be glad about it.

167
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,544
I want you to curse and fight
until your heart's done pumping.

168
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:55,255
And know this, boy.

169
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,759
Your death will be a gift
for them south of the Wall.

170
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,178
They'll never know what you've done.

171
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,182
They'll never know how you died.
They won't even know your damn name.

172
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,060
But they'll be alive because
some nameless bastard

173
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,646
north of the Wall gave his life for theirs.

174
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,483
Now, do you understand me?

175
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,777
I do.

176
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,612
You're even dumber than you look.

177
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,241
It's just words, boy,

178
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,118
to keep us a little warmer in the night.

179
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,287
Make us feel like we've got a purpose.

180
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,748
Come on.

181
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:33,419
We've got to find these goat fuckers
before night falls and they find us.

182
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,975
- Can you read?
- My lord?

183
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,853
Can you read?

184
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,276
This letter detailing our infantry movements

185
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,862
was meant for Lord Damon
of House Marbrand.

186
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:03,699
It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.

187
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:05,576
My apologies, my lord. I must have...

188
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,037
Girl, fetch me the History of the
Greater and the Lesser Houses.

189
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,998
It's the one on this...

190
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,713
My cupbearer can read better than you.

191
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,267
To whom does House Dormand
owe allegiance?

192
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,688
My lord, I...

193
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,483
To the Starks of Winterfell!

194
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,737
Who have 20,000 men and my son!

195
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:47,951
I judged you might be good for something
more than brutalizing peasants.

196
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,287
I see I overestimated you.

197
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,334
If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll...

198
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:57,753
Leave us.

199
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:07,346
Put the book away, girl.

200
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,814
Maybe you should devise our next battle plan
while you're about it.

201
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,405
Lord Petyr Baelish.

202
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,490
Mmm.

203
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,284
Give us the room.

204
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,377
Clear all this.

205
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,675
- Lord Tywin.
- Baelish.

206
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,310
- Wine?
- Thank you.

207
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,190
What news from the capital?

208
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:03,652
I traveled here directly
from Renly Baratheon's camp.

209
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,737
Ah, the late King Renly.

210
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,365
Rather a short reign.

211
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,284
Murdered by a woman, I hear.

212
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,286
So they say.

213
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:17,082
There has been talk of other forces at work.

214
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,501
Dark forces.

215
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,212
Here.

216
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,094
Men love to blame demons
when their grand plans unravel.

217
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:36,184
It is my belief that a moment of chaos
affords opportunities lost soon after.

218
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,688
You say that as if you were
the first man alive to think it.

219
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,773
Yes, a crisis is an opportunity.

220
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,776
What other brilliant insights
have you brought me today?

221
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:48,614
After the Lannisters and the Starks,
the Tyrells command the largest host.

222
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,782
Their lands are the most fertile
in the Seven Kingdoms,

223
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:54,828
- feeding horses and soldiers.
- Yes, yes, yes.

224
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:58,332
The Tyrells have not yet declared
for any of the surviving kings.

225
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,961
Loras wants revenge.
He blames Stannis for Renly's death.

226
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,213
And Margaery...

227
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:07,174
Wants to be queen.

228
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,301
Yes, she does.

229
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:14,514
House Tyrell rebelled against the lron Throne.

230
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,976
- Against my grandson.
- They did.

231
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,480
And perhaps that treason should be punished

232
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,190
one day,

233
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:26,526
after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated.

234
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,073
More wine for Lord Baelish.

235
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,832
If you will allow me to
represent your family's interests,

236
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,335
I believe that an advantageous agreement...

237
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,879
The Tyrell host has returned to Highgarden?

238
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,339
They have.

239
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,509
Pardon, my lord.

240
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,260
It's only wine.

241
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,639
You would ride there yourself?

242
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,474
Tonight, with your leave.

243
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,309
I'll have an answer by nightfall.

244
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:00,977
That'll be all, girl.

245
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,777
And what else?

246
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,696
On your son Tyrion's directive,

247
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,823
I met with Catelyn Stark.

248
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,866
Why?

249
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:19,162
He had an interesting proposal for her
concerning her daughters.

250
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,288
Hmm.

251
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,591
- A girl.
- A wildling.

252
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,594
We could question her.

253
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:17,804
You could.

254
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,139
She won't answer.

255
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,934
I've known a wildling to bite off his tongue
instead of talking.

256
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,938
- What's your name?
- Ygritte.

257
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:30,066
She was reaching for this ax
when you got to her.

258
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,652
Give her half a chance,
she'll bury it in your face.

259
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,864
I gave you my name.

260
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,825
I'm Jon Snow.

261
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,211
You ought to burn them you killed.

262
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,171
We'd need a big fire for that.

263
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,716
Tell me, Ygritte.

264
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,511
Why do you want us to build a big fire?

265
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,639
Are there some more friends in the area?

266
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:04,059
Burn them or maybe
you'll need those swords again.

267
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,812
Our boy here's already killed one dead man.

268
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,272
He can do it again if he has to.

269
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,608
What waits beyond the pass?

270
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,735
- The free folk.
- How many?

271
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,739
Hundreds and thousands.

272
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,116
More than you've ever seen, crow.

273
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,994
Why come to the mountains?

274
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,456
What's in the Frostfangs
your king could want?

275
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,424
Do you mean to march on the Wall?

276
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,641
Do you know who I am, girl?

277
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,227
Qhorin Half hand.

278
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:48,895
Tell me true.

279
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,566
If your people captured me,

280
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:54,317
would they take me prisoner?

281
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:58,446
They'd take your head off your shoulders
if they was feeling kind.

282
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,074
If not, they'd kill you slow.

283
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,538
We have no food for her.

284
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,874
Can't spare a man to watch her.

285
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,168
Can't let her go.
She'll bring Mance Rayder's army down on us.

286
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,046
- It needs to be done. Want me to do it?
- No.

287
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,592
No, I'll do it.

288
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,012
Come, brothers.

289
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,306
We'll leave him to it.

290
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,600
We'll meet you at the top.

291
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,351
Don't take too long.

292
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:29,644
We're deep in their country now.

293
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,869
You never killed a woman before, did you?

294
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,663
You don't need to do it.

295
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,750
Mance would take you. I know he would.

296
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,210
There's secret ways.

297
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:56,546
The crows would never catch us.

298
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,925
I'm as much a crow as they are.

299
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:13,939
Will you burn me?

300
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,191
After?

301
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,234
Can't.

302
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,529
Someone might see the smoke.

303
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,579
Strike hard and true,

304
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:30,872
Jon Snow,

305
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,708
or I'll come back and haunt you.

306
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,547
That's cold.

307
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,469
Go on.

308
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,471
Be quick about it.

309
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,730
Do it.

310
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,360
Bastard, do it!

311
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,147
You can't do it. We both know it.

312
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,197
The sun's going down, Jon Snow.

313
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,282
And your friends are nowhere close.

314
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,159
I'll find them.

315
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,579
Call for them. Go on.

316
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,372
Call loudly.

317
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,092
May the Seven guide the princess
on herjourney.

318
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,469
May the Mother give her health.

319
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:52,013
May the crone give her wisdom.

320
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,058
May the warrior give her courage.

321
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,607
One day I pray you love someone.

322
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,527
I pray you love her so much,

323
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:08,238
when you close your eyes, you see her face.

324
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,033
I want that for you.

325
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,579
I want you to know
what it's like to love someone,

326
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,374
to truly love someone.

327
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,086
Before I take her from you.

328
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,981
You sound like a little cat
mewling for his mother.

329
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,440
Princes don't cry.

330
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,235
- I saw you cry.
- Did you say something, my lady?

331
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:50,822
My little brother cried when I left Winterfell.

332
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,323
So?

333
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:53,908
It seems a normal thing.

334
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,536
Is your little brother a prince?

335
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,704
No.

336
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,081
Not really relevant then, is it?

337
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:05,628
Come, dog.

338
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,014
Hail Joffrey!

339
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,891
Hail to the King.

340
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,520
Seven blessings on you, Your Grace.

341
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:24,397
Murderer! Bastard!

342
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:25,899
All hail the King.

343
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:28,401
He's no king. He's a bastard!

344
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,654
Please, Your Grace, we're hungry.

345
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,867
Freak.

346
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,619
Get the Prince back to the Keep now.

347
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,621
Yes, my lord. Come, quickly.

348
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,998
Please, Your Grace,
give us some food!

349
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,167
Bread, Your Grace, please!

350
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,797
Who threw that?

351
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,382
I want the man who threw that.

352
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,218
Find who did that and bring him to me!

353
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:55,428
- Hold on!
- Hold them back!

354
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,388
Just kill them! Kill them all!

355
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:05,855
- Move. Move!
- Pull back!

356
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,232
Tear him to pieces!

357
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:10,109
What are you doing?
I want these people executed!

358
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,028
And they want the same for you.

359
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,307
Where's Sansa?

360
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,521
- Through the door.
- Come on.

361
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,981
Push hard.

362
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:53,945
Protect the king!

363
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,114
- Get back!
- Fall back!

364
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:13,881
Keep him safe!

365
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,341
Brotherfucker!

366
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,386
- Watch out.
- Hold them back.

367
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,520
Hey.

368
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:30,773
Traitors!

369
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:34,235
- I'll have all their heads.
- You blind, bloody fool.

370
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,321
You can't insult me.

371
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:39,490
We've had vicious kings
and we've had idiot kings,

372
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:42,160
but I don't know if we've ever been
cursed with a vicious idiot for a king.

373
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:43,786
- You can't...
- I can, I am.

374
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:45,330
They attacked me!

375
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:49,042
They threw a cow pie at you,
so you decided to kill them all?

376
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,835
They're starving, you fool.

377
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,253
All because of a war you started.

378
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:54,047
You're talking to a king!

379
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,175
And now I've struck a king.

380
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,718
Did my hand fall from my wrist?

381
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:01,763
Where is the Stark girl?

382
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,014
Let them have her.

383
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,559
If she dies, you'll never
get your Uncle Jaime back.

384
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,395
You owe him quite a bit, you know.

385
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,739
Where are you going?

386
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:23,951
You ever been fucked, little girl?

387
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,704
Come here.

388
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,123
Take some men and go and find the Stark girl.

389
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:31,334
I take my orders from the king.

390
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,336
- Where?
- This way.

391
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:42,178
Please!

392
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,722
No! No!

393
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,118
Please!

394
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,499
You're all right now, little bird.
You're all right.

395
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,682
We'll get you. We'll get you.

396
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:29,600
This way.

397
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,813
Are you hurt, my lady?

398
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:37,066
The little bird's bleeding.
Someone take her back to her cage.

399
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:39,360
- See to that cut.
- Well done, Clegane.

400
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:42,697
I didn't do it for you.

401
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,909
He shouldn't make me wait.

402
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:50,872
The Spice King is
the second wealthiest man in Qarth.

403
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,374
He makes everyone wait.

404
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:56,669
Of course, you could have
avoided this embarrassment

405
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,505
if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth.

406
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,340
I already have a husband.

407
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,551
Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi.

408
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:07,138
You are far too young to be a widow forever

409
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,183
and far too beautiful.

410
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:14,228
And you are far too smart
to think that I will succumb to flattery.

411
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,356
I have traveled very far in my life

412
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,150
and met many women,

413
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,902
but none that are immune to flattery.

414
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,738
The Mother of Dragons!

415
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,531
Here he comes.

416
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:28,951
Forgive me. I had terrible dreams last night.

417
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,745
Terrible dreams.

418
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:34,123
I could not sleep until the sun was shining

419
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,334
and the birds were singing.

420
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:39,462
Look what a beauty you are

421
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,756
now the Red Waste has been washed off you.

422
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:45,593
I am sorry about all that unpleasantness.

423
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:49,764
The silver hair of a true Targaryen.

424
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,350
Xaro Xhoan Daxos,

425
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:55,937
she is far too lovely for
a glorified dockworker like yourself.

426
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:59,482
Very true, and yet they say
that your grandfather,

427
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,692
who sold pepper off the back of a wagon,

428
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:05,112
married a lady far lovelier
and higher born than himself.

429
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,406
Every lady alive was lovelier

430
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:09,700
and higher born than my grandfather.

431
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:15,373
Did my servants not offer you
something to eat, to drink?

432
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,749
I'll have them flogged in the square.

433
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,210
Thank you, my lord. You are a gracious host,

434
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,796
but there is no servant alive
that can bring me what I want.

435
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,382
Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one.

436
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:28,719
So, my little princess, what is it you want?

437
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,263
My birthright.

438
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:32,139
The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.

439
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:35,101
I fear I'm no better
than a servant in this regard.

440
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:37,186
I cannot give you what I do not have.

441
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:39,939
I'm not asking you for the kingdoms.

442
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,524
I'm asking you for ships.

443
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,109
I need to cross the Narrow Sea.

444
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:44,944
I need my ships as well.

445
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:48,614
I use them, you see,
to bring spices from one port to another.

446
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:50,616
Whatever you grant me now will be repaid

447
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:53,160
three times over
when I retake the lron Throne.

448
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,287
Retake?

449
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:57,081
Did you once sit on the lron Throne?

450
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,834
My father sat there, before he was murdered.

451
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:02,253
But if you did not sit on it yourself,

452
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,673
would it not be correct
to say "take the lron Throne"?

453
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,925
I didn't come here to argue grammar.

454
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,511
Of course not. You came to take my ships.

455
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,765
So let me explain my position, little princess.

456
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:19,020
Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors.

457
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,771
I make my living by trade.

458
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:23,733
And I judge every trade on its merits.

459
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:25,901
You ask for ships.

460
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:28,738
You say I shall be repaid triple.

461
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,782
I do not doubt your honesty
or your intentions.

462
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,118
But before you repay your debts,

463
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,537
you must seize the Seven Kingdoms.

464
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,956
- Do you have an army?
- Not yet.

465
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:40,583
You do not have an army.

466
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:43,336
Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?

467
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,296
There are many there that support my claim.

468
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,422
When were you there last?

469
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,342
I left when I was a baby.

470
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,178
So, in truth, you have no allies.

471
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:56,682
The people will rise to fight for
their rightful queen when I return.

472
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:57,892
Ah.

473
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,311
Forgive me, little princess,

474
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,898
but I cannot make an investment
based on wishes and dreams.

475
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:05,399
Now if you'll pardon me.

476
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:08,069
Do you know lllyrio Mopatis,
Magister of Pentos?

477
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,905
Yes, we've met. A shrewd man.

478
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:14,241
For my wedding, he gave me
three petrified dragon eggs.

479
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:19,163
He believed... The world believed
that the ages had turned them to stone.

480
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:22,667
How many centuries has it been
since dragons roamed the skies?

481
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:25,503
But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs

482
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,922
into a great fire, they would hatch.

483
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:32,343
When I stepped into the fire,
my own people thought I was mad.

484
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:35,137
But when the fire burned out,

485
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:37,056
I was unhurt,

486
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,392
the Mother of Dragons.

487
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,188
Do you understand?

488
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,485
I'm no ordinary woman.

489
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,488
My dreams come true.

490
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,620
I admire your passion.

491
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,458
But in business, I trust in logic, not passion.

492
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:07,044
I'm sorry, little princess.

493
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:08,838
I am not your little princess.

494
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:12,341
I am Daenerys Stormborn
of the blood of Old Valyria,

495
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:14,218
and I will take what is mine.

496
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,679
With fire and blood, I will take it.

497
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:20,433
Yes, my lady, but not with my ships.

498
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,454
Who taught you to read?

499
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,664
My father, my lord.

500
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:44,749
Hmm.

501
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,169
I taught my son Jaime to read.

502
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:54,508
The maester came to me one day,
told me he wasn't learning.

503
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:57,303
He couldn't make sense of the letters.

504
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,805
He reversed them in his head.

505
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:03,976
The maester said he'd heard tell
of this affliction

506
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,228
and that we simply must accept it.

507
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:07,313
Ha!

508
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:14,320
After that, I sat Jaime down
for four hours every day until he learned.

509
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,365
He hated me for it, for a time.

510
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,452
For a long time.

511
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,038
But he learned.

512
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,457
Hmm.

513
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,629
Where is your father? Is he alive?

514
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:36,425
Who was he?

515
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,178
A stonemason.

516
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,514
A stonemason who could read?

517
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,640
Hmm.

518
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:43,849
He taught himself.

519
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,519
Quite a man.

520
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:49,396
What killed him?

521
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,150
Loyalty.

522
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,238
You're a sharp little thing, aren't you?

523
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:02,117
Did...

524
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,872
Forgive me, my lord.
I shouldn't ask questions.

525
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,583
No.

526
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,586
But you've already begun.

527
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,632
Did you know your father, my lord?

528
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,426
I did.

529
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,055
I grew up with him.

530
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,434
I watched him grow old.

531
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:32,356
He loved us.

532
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,608
He was a good man,

533
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:37,736
but a weak man.

534
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:41,615
A weak man who nearly destroyed
our house and name.

535
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:45,536
I'm cold.

536
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,747
I'll fetch more wood for the fire, my lord.

537
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:49,874
Mmm.

538
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,194
Where are you going, girl?

539
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:22,031
The armory, my lord.

540
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,492
- Why?
- Lord Tywin sent me.

541
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,663
What might this be?

542
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,499
Lord Tywin gave it to me.

543
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:34,877
What for?

544
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,379
To take to the armory.

545
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,049
Why would he do that?

546
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,303
Let's go and ask him.

547
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,640
Move!

548
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:52,019
Get out of the way!

549
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,176
Amory Lorch.

550
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:26,971
A girl has named a second name.

551
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,305
A man will do what must be done.

552
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,431
Now!

553
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,560
A girl cannot tell a man
when exactly he must do a thing.

554
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,480
A man cannot make a thing
happen before its time.

555
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,232
But he's going to tell Tywin.
He's getting away.

556
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,900
It has to be now.

557
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:49,910
Guard!

558
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,381
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

559
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,846
My honor, Your Grace.

560
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,389
Your Grace.

561
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,397
- Your Grace.
- Quent.

562
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,837
Lady Talisa.

563
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,631
Your Grace.

564
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:47,760
I'm not sure I'm a lady.

565
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:50,304
Westerosi customs are
still a bit foreign to me.

566
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,264
It's hard to keep all the rules straight.

567
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:55,559
But if I remember my lessons,

568
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,437
a woman of noble birth
is always called a lady.

569
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,231
Unless she's a queen or a princess.

570
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:02,816
I could find someone who knows.

571
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,110
Why are you so sure I'm of noble birth?

572
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,279
Because it's obvious.

573
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,283
What if I told you my father
sold lace on the Long Bridge,

574
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,827
and my mother, my brother and I
lived with him above our shop?

575
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,414
I'd call you a liar.

576
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:20,167
Not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty.

577
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,340
I always thought I was a brilliant liar.

578
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,384
Better at amputations, I'm afraid.

579
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,184
Quite a pretty spot.

580
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,852
Will we be here long?

581
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,855
I couldn't really discuss
troop movements with you.

582
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,067
I'm not a spy.

583
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,319
Of course, a spy would deny being a spy.

584
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,740
You're right. You've found me out.

585
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:55,369
I'm writing a letter to the Lannisters.
"The young wolf is on the move."

586
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,206
Perhaps you'd join me.

587
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:03,710
If you've got time, of course, for, well...

588
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:04,795
Robb.

589
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,632
Mother.

590
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,891
Mother, this is Lady Talisa.

591
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,269
She's been helping with the wounded.

592
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:22,980
She's been very helpful.

593
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,233
- Lady Talisa.
- Lady Stark.

594
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,694
Lady Talisa...

595
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,071
- Maegyr.
- Maegyr?

596
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,867
Forgive me, I do not know this name.

597
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:37,786
An uncommon name here.
An old name in Volantis.

598
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,331
Excuse me, my lady. Your Grace.

599
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,509
I've missed you.

600
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:55,971
Yes, you look positively forlorn.

601
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,098
You surprised me, that's all.

602
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,560
I didn't think I'd see you today.

603
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,521
I wish that you were free to follow your heart.

604
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:06,023
I know.

605
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,734
You have inherited
your father's responsibilities.

606
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,737
I'm afraid they come at a cost.

607
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:14,948
- You are promised to another.
- I know.

608
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,243
A debt that must be paid.

609
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:23,248
- I haven't forgotten.
- Your Grace. My lady.

610
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:25,375
News from Winterfell.

611
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:39,890
Your brothers desert you?

612
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,809
I can tell you which way to go.

613
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,063
We'll stop here.

614
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:47,981
Too dark to go any farther today.

615
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:50,609
Here? There's no shelter here.

616
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,069
There's no shelter anywhere.

617
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,738
There is...
if you know where to look.

618
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,202
The cold could kill us both.

619
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,496
- If you light a fire...
- No fire.

620
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,706
- But a fire is...
- No fire.

621
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,419
Have it your way.

622
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:19,513
We'll stay warmer if we stay close.

623
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:24,226
Bet you freeze to death before I do.

624
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:26,979
Bet your life.

625
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:54,881
Think they're out looking for you?

626
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:58,427
- Yes.
- Think they'll find you?

627
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:01,346
Yes.

628
00:44:04,017 --> 00:44:05,559
You're brave.

629
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,395
Stupid,

630
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,355
but brave.

631
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:16,820
We start again at first light. Get some sleep.

632
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,504
Stop moving.

633
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:36,423
I'm just trying to get comfortable.

634
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,426
Stop it!

635
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:54,191
- You're still moving.
- Was I?

636
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,110
I didn't notice that time.

637
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:10,540
This cannot be true.

638
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,709
We've had ravens from White Harbor,

639
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:14,753
Barrowton and the Dreadfort.

640
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,129
I'm afraid it is true.

641
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,049
Why? Why would Theon...

642
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,510
Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores.

643
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:25,055
- My brothers?
- We've heard nothing of them.

644
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,975
But Rodrik Cassel is dead.

645
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,979
I told you, never trust a Greyjoy!

646
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:38,235
I must go north at once.

647
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,028
There's still a war to win, Your Grace.

648
00:45:40,113 --> 00:45:43,198
How can I call myself king
if I can't hold my own castle?

649
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:46,118
- How can I ask men to follow me if I can't...
- You are a king.

650
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:49,037
And that means you don't have
to do everything yourself.

651
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:50,872
Let me go and talk to Theon.

652
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:52,916
There will be no talk. He will die for this.

653
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:57,212
Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew.

654
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,881
Let me send word to
my bastard at the Dreadfort.

655
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:03,927
He can raise a few hundred men and retake
Winterfell before the new moon.

656
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,638
We have the Lannisters on the run.

657
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:10,934
If you march all the way back north now,
you'll lose what you gained.

658
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:15,230
My boy would be honored
to bring you Prince Theon's head.

659
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:19,818
Tell your son Bran and
Rickon's safety is paramount.

660
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,654
And Theon, I want him brought to me alive.

661
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:27,200
I want to look him in the eye and ask him why.

662
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,453
And then I'll take his head myself.

663
00:46:30,163 --> 00:46:33,457
Why on earth would I trust the word
of a lying little savage like you?

664
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,000
I'm no liar.

665
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:40,672
All wildlings are liars and savages
with no loyalty to anything or anyone.

666
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,716
I done what I had to do to stay alive.

667
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:46,261
I hate the Starks as well as you do.

668
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:47,929
Let me serve you, my lord.

669
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,600
How? And don't tell me
to put a spear in your hand.

670
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,227
There are other ways to serve, my lord.

671
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:59,733
- I'm a prince now, and you'd do well...
- There are other ways to serve, my prince.

672
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,572
Like what?

673
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,952
We know things, the free people.

674
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,788
You know things?

675
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:16,082
Like what?

676
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,751
How to eat dirt?

677
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,171
Other things.

678
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,674
Savage things.

679
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:28,470
Wait outside.

680
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,781
I always wondered what you had under there.

681
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,992
It comes at a price.

682
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,119
I'm not killing you. That's your price.

683
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:54,663
I already had that.

684
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:58,166
What do you want then,

685
00:47:58,251 --> 00:47:59,834
other than your miserable life?

686
00:48:00,962 --> 00:48:02,462
What all free people want.

687
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:04,339
My freedom.

688
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:11,638
Well, you shall have it, then.

689
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:16,184
But only if you serve me well.

690
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:24,150
- Ow!
- Shh.

691
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:27,195
- It's not deep.
- I thought they were going to kill me.

692
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,406
They thought so, too.

693
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,575
He hated me, the man who hit me.

694
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:33,994
I saw it in his eyes. Hated me.

695
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:38,623
He never met me before,
but he wanted to hurt me.

696
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:42,085
- Of course he did.
- Why? Why would a stranger...

697
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,379
You are everything he will never have.

698
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,756
Your horse eats better than his children.

699
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:49,676
It doesn't matter now. He's dead.

700
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,512
I would have given them bread if I had it.

701
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,223
I hate the king more than any of them.

702
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,392
Don't say these things.

703
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:58,560
If the wrong people hear you...

704
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,645
But you're not the wrong people.

705
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:08,403
Don't trust anybody.

706
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:10,488
Life is safer that way.

707
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,698
And where are you going?

708
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,662
I have something for you from Prince Theon.

709
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:00,705
- What?
- Me.

710
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,294
He says I'm to make the rounds.

711
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:14,719
And keep you warm.

712
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:45,917
The Spice King refuses me
because I'm a bad investment.

713
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:49,379
The Silk King won't support me
because of his business with the Lannisters.

714
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,464
Why offend his best customer?

715
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:55,009
And the Copper King offers me a single ship

716
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:57,721
on the condition that I lie with him for a night.

717
00:50:57,805 --> 00:51:00,682
Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?

718
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:04,477
When I came to this city, I had nothing.

719
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:06,813
Truly nothing.

720
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:09,399
I slept by the docks.

721
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:12,402
And when I could find work
loading the ships, I would eat.

722
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,529
If not, I dreamed of food.

723
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:17,782
Today, I am the richest man in Qarth.

724
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:23,037
Do you think the path from poverty to wealth
is always pure and honorable?

725
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:28,376
I have done many things, Khaleesi,
that a righteous man would condemn.

726
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:32,756
And here I am, with no regrets.

727
00:51:45,895 --> 00:51:48,855
Bar the gates. Ring the bells.

728
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:51,274
Slowly, Khaleesi.

729
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:03,036
Where are they?

730
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:12,253
Where are my dragons?
1
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,672
A cripple?

2
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,509
You let a cripple escape?

3
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:19,555
The boy can't walk,
but somehow he slipped past you?

4
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,183
The giant must have took him.

5
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,062
The giant?

6
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,147
Hodor?

7
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,943
Oh, that's all right, then.

8
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:34,737
You let a halfwit escape with a cripple.

9
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,281
And Rickon, too? The little one?

10
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,867
Gone, along with the wildling woman.

11
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,995
The one you were fucking.

12
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,599
Right.

13
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,977
Get the horses and the hounds.

14
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,858
Come on, find the scent.

15
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,488
Where they going?

16
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,875
Halt!

17
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,172
Enjoying your first hunt?

18
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:38,384
So far, hunting seems
very similar to riding, my lord.

19
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,344
With hunting, there's blood at the end.

20
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:41,596
They're little boys.

21
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,349
I was a little boy when I was torn away
from my home and brought here.

22
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:48,644
So I kept my word. I never ran away.

23
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,814
If I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them.

24
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,985
Well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them.

25
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:59,530
Those boys are of far more value
to you alive than dead.

26
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:01,032
They have no value to me missing.

27
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,451
Robb will have sent a force
to retake Winterfell by now.

28
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:06,871
Robb's in the Riverlands.
My sister's in Deepwood Motte.

29
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,498
She'll get here long before they do.

30
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:14,378
And Ned Stark always said
500 men could hold Winterfell against 10,000.

31
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,881
We have a scent!

32
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,090
The hounds have the scent.

33
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,928
Come, Maester, don't look so grim.

34
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,513
It's all just a game.

35
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:41,989
We should have took more food.

36
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,158
We couldn't risk going to the kitchens.

37
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,869
Those people all love you. They would have
given you whatever you needed.

38
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,246
And if Theon found out, he'd hang them.

39
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,707
- The boy can't survive on walnuts.
- I'm fine.

40
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,212
We've been walking since before sunrise.

41
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,506
- Even Hodor will tire.
- Hodor.

42
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,050
- Even you, sweet giant.
- Hodor.

43
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:07,348
Wait, I know that farm.

44
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,059
I sent those two Winterfell orphans there.

45
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,144
Jack and Billy.

46
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,981
- They'll give us some food.
- We can't risk it.

47
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:18,859
If Theon tracks us here, he'll torture them
until he finds out where we are.

48
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:21,320
Billy climbs a tree better than anyone.

49
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,072
You've never seen me climb a tree, little man.

50
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,825
They'll be after us with hounds.

51
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:29,328
We got a good start on them,
but we can't outrun hounds forever.

52
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,440
Did you pull a knife on me in the night?

53
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,785
What's the matter?

54
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,747
Can't be the first time you pressed your bone
against a woman's arse.

55
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,667
Let's move.

56
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:24,884
It is the first time.

57
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,220
How old are you, boy?

58
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,806
I'm a man of the Night's Watch.

59
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,519
You're a boy who's never been with a girl.

60
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:43,152
Don't your stones start to hurt
if your bone never gets...

61
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,529
Don't call them that.

62
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,531
What, stones?

63
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,659
Or bone?

64
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,369
Neither.

65
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,663
Both.

66
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,793
Move!

67
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:08,427
I heard they get all swollen and bruised
if you don't use them.

68
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:13,015
Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say
when they want me feeling sorry for them.

69
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,059
As if I'd feel sorry for them.

70
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,521
Are there no girl crows?

71
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,942
There are no women of the Night's Watch, no.

72
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,735
So the lads just do it with each other?

73
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,903
No.

74
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,364
- Never?
- Never.

75
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,033
We swore an oath.

76
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,869
You have sheep at the Wall?

77
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,332
With your hands, then?

78
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:41,001
No wonder you're all so miserable.

79
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,880
- Would you please shut up?
- Would you please shut up?

80
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,926
You think you're better than me, crow.

81
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,303
- I'm a free woman.
- You're a free woman?

82
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,556
I might be your prisoner,
but I'm a free woman.

83
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,143
If you're my prisoner, you're not
a free woman. That's what "prisoner" means.

84
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,145
And you think you're free?

85
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,858
You swore some stupid oath
and now you can never touch a girl.

86
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,152
It was my choice to say the words.

87
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,237
- So you don't like girls?
- Of course I like girls.

88
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,905
But you chose never to touch them.

89
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,867
That's the price you pay
if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.

90
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:16,328
So instead of getting naked with a girl,
you'd prefer to invade our lands...

91
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,038
invade your lands?

92
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,291
Wildlings raid our lands all the time.

93
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,002
Some of them tried to kill my little brother,
a crippled boy!

94
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,962
They're not your lands!

95
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,173
We've been here the whole time.

96
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:30,593
You lot came along and just put up a big wall
and said it was yours.

97
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,970
My father was Ned Stark.

98
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,347
I have the blood of the First Men.

99
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,100
My ancestors lived here, same as yours.

100
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,771
So why are you fighting us?

101
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,456
Go on.

102
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,797
Now I want you to tell me
what happened.

103
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,549
Come on, this way.

104
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,638
Come on, speak up. Speak up.

105
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,186
Wolfsbane.

106
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,314
A rare substance.

107
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,525
This is no common assassin.

108
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,861
We hanged 20 men last night.

109
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,239
I don't care if you hanged 100.

110
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,284
A man tried to kill me.
I want his name and I want his head.

111
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:41,205
We think it was an infiltrator from
the Brotherhood Without Banners.

112
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,416
Pretentious name for a band of outlaws.

113
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:49,171
We can't allow rebels behind our lines
to harass us with impunity.

114
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:53,050
We look like fools and they look like heroes.
That's how kings fall.

115
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,219
I want them dead, every one.

116
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,012
Killing them isn't the problem.

117
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:58,973
It's finding them.

118
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,349
Have you gone soft, Clegane?

119
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,435
I always thought you had a talent for violence.

120
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,230
Burn the villages, burn the farms.

121
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,441
Let them know what it means
to choose the wrong side.

122
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:10,526
Mmm.

123
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,572
Is that mutton?

124
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,324
Yes, my lord.

125
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:18,575
Don't like mutton.

126
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,746
- I'll bring something else.
- Leave it.

127
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,626
- Are you hungry?
- No.

128
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,378
Of course you are.

129
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,130
Eat.

130
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:33,882
I'll eat in the kitchen later.

131
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,386
It's bad manners to refuse a lord's offer.

132
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,513
Sit.

133
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,683
Eat.

134
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,229
You're small for your age.

135
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,608
I suppose you've been underfed
your whole life.

136
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:52,860
I eat a lot.

137
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:54,903
I just don't grow.

138
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,071
Mmm.

139
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,660
This will be my last war.

140
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:04,872
Win or lose.

141
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,625
Have you ever lost before?

142
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:12,504
Do you think I'd be in my position
if I had lost a war?

143
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,637
But this is the one I'll be remembered for.

144
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,600
The War of Five Kings, they're calling it.

145
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,313
My legacy will be determined
in the coming months.

146
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,650
Do you know what legacy means?

147
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:40,407
It's what you pass down to your children
and your children's children.

148
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,787
It's what remains of you when you're gone.

149
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,627
Harren the Black thought
this castle would be his legacy.

150
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,298
The greatest fortress ever built.

151
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:59,134
The tallest towers, the strongest walls.

152
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,346
The Great Hall had 35 hearths.

153
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,474
Thirty-five. Can you imagine?

154
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:07,976
Look at it now.

155
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,938
A blasted ruin.

156
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,316
Do you know what happened?

157
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,026
Dragons?

158
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:17,653
Yes.

159
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,155
Dragons happened.

160
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:27,496
Harrenhal was built to withstand
an attack from the land.

161
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,210
A million men could have
marched on these walls,

162
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,504
and a million men would have been repelled.

163
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,175
But an attack from the air with dragon fire...
Mmm-mmm.

164
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,388
Harren and all his sons
roasted alive within these walls.

165
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,975
Aegon Targaryen changed the rules.

166
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,563
That's why every child alive
still knows his name

167
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,481
300 years after his death.

168
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,733
Aegon and his sisters.

169
00:12:58,653 --> 00:12:59,653
Mmm?

170
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,573
It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon.

171
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,700
It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too.

172
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:06,535
Correct.

173
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,204
A student of history, are you?

174
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,331
Rhaenys rode Meraxes.

175
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,417
Visenya rode Vhagar.

176
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,838
I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.

177
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,883
Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior.

178
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:25,179
She had a Valyrian steel sword
she called Dark Sister.

179
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,431
Hmm.

180
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,558
She's a heroine of yours, I take it?

181
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,521
Aren't most girls more interested
in the pretty maidens from the songs?

182
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:36,815
Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?

183
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,775
Most girls are idiots.

184
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,946
You remind me of my daughter.

185
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:49,244
Where did you learn all this stuff about
Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?

186
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,414
From my father.

187
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,085
He was a well-read stonemason.

188
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,757
Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.

189
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,093
Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?

190
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,181
Careful now, girl.

191
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,934
I enjoy you, but be careful.

192
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,520
Take that back to the kitchen.

193
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,480
Eat what you want.

194
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,443
And, girl.

195
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,988
"M'lord."

196
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,618
Lowborn girls say "m'lord,"

197
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,787
not "my lord."

198
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,582
if you're going to pose as a commoner,
you should do it properly.

199
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:41,713
My mother served Lady Dustin
for many years, my lord.

200
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,384
She taught me how to speak proper...
Properly.

201
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:51,348
You're too smart for your own good.
Has anyone told you that?

202
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:52,808
Yes.

203
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,185
Go on.

204
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,657
I beg pardon, ser.

205
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:14,496
I should have come to you after
to thank you for saving me.

206
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,124
- You were so brave.
- Brave?

207
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,711
A dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats.

208
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,547
Does it give you joy to scare people?

209
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,550
No, it gives me joy to kill people.

210
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,011
Spare me. You can't tell me

211
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:32,014
Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell
never killed a man.

212
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:34,891
It was his duty. He never liked it.

213
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,603
Is that what he told you?

214
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:38,854
He lied.

215
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,732
Killing is the sweetest thing there is.

216
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,277
Why are you always so hateful?

217
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,989
You'll be glad of the hateful things I do
someday when you're queen

218
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:52,326
and I'm all that stands between you
and your beloved king.

219
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:05,380
I've demanded a meeting of the Thirteen.
One of them did this or knows who did.

220
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,090
You are one of the Thirteen.

221
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:09,259
If I wanted your dragons,
I would have taken them.

222
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:12,429
- They mean nothing to me on their own.
- Nothing?

223
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,098
They're more valuable
than anything in the world.

224
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:16,642
Shall we look inside my vault

225
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,853
and see what selling your dragons
would buy me I cannot buy already?

226
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,938
We will get them back.

227
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:26,693
There is no we,
so why would you help me get them back?

228
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:30,238
I took you under my protection
in front of the rulers of my city.

229
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,658
A man is what others say he is and no more.

230
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:37,788
If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar,
my word is worth nothing.

231
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,291
I cannot let this thing happen to you
under my roof.

232
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,585
But it did happen under your roof.

233
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,047
Khaleesi, many times in my life, I have been...

234
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,757
I don't care where you've been.

235
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:15,784
You think we're savages
because we don't live in stone castles.

236
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,621
We can't make steel as good as yours,
it's true, but...

237
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,373
We're free.

238
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,502
If someone tried to tell us
we couldn't lie down as man and woman,

239
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,796
we'd shove a spear up his arse.

240
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,717
We don't go serving some shit king
who's only king because his father was.

241
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,135
No.

242
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,513
No, you serve Mance Rayder,
the King beyond the Wall.

243
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,974
We chose Mance Rayder to lead us.

244
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:44,020
He was a crow, same as you,
but he wanted to be free.

245
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,858
You could be free, too.

246
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:52,487
You don't need to live your whole life
taking commands from old men.

247
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,198
Wake up when you want to wake up.

248
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,869
I could show you the streams to fish,
the woods to hunt.

249
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:02,289
Build yourself a cabin and
find a woman to lie with in the night.

250
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,209
You're a pretty lad.

251
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,588
The girls would claw each other's eyes out
to get naked with you.

252
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,633
Walk.

253
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,180
I could teach you how to do it.

254
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,348
I know how to do it.

255
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,645
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

256
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,760
And what did she say?

257
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,471
She admired your spirit, Your Grace.

258
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,389
And what then?

259
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,643
She...

260
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:11,399
if every man were held accountable for the
actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton,

261
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,651
we'd all hang.

262
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,156
She tore the paper in half, Your Grace.

263
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,742
You've acted with honor.

264
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,494
I thank you for it.

265
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:27,499
Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's
pen is clean, and give him a hot supper.

266
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,252
Ser Alton's pen is occupied, Your Grace.

267
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,420
The prisoners from the Yellow Fork.

268
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,589
Too many prisoners.

269
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,300
Is there room for Ser Alton?

270
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,886
Does he need to lie down?

271
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:44,766
Have the men build him a new pen.

272
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,561
Put him in with the Kingslayer for now.

273
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,646
Have your boy watch over them.

274
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,439
Torrhen.

275
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,775
That will be all.

276
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,117
Your Grace.

277
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,286
A minute of your time?

278
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,219
I've been treating your wounded men.

279
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:24,973
And my enemies, as some of my bannermen
are fond of mentioning.

280
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:26,850
They're not my enemies.

281
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,144
That's what I tell my bannermen.

282
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:32,063
I've already run through the supplies
I brought with me.

283
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:36,276
Some are easily replaced.
Egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses.

284
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:38,612
But some are not.

285
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,156
I need silk for stitching.

286
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:47,495
I need fennel root for those with fever,
willow bark. Mostly I need milk of the poppy.

287
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,290
You saw what it was like
to amputate a foot without any.

288
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:55,211
I assume there will be more loss of limb
before this war is over.

289
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:59,007
- If you need help finding these...
- I know where to find them.

290
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,636
I'm sorry, I shouldn't interrupt you.

291
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,680
Continue, my lady.

292
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,395
You're riding to the Crag
to negotiate a surrender?

293
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,521
Yes.

294
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,775
The Crag will have a maester
and he will have what I need.

295
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,110
I expect he will.

296
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,279
If I could write a list.

297
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:23,198
Come with me to the Crag.

298
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,576
I don't think that will be...

299
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:28,703
Let the maester show you his stores.

300
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,290
I want the wounded men to be treated well,

301
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,001
all the wounded men.

302
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,303
- Children, come inside, quick.
- Come on.

303
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:46,888
Hurry up!

304
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,767
Can't find anything, ser.

305
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,311
- They've lost the scent.
- Try again.

306
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,815
We've circled this farmhouse twice.
There's no sign of them.

307
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:59,734
We could start the search fresh
in the morning, my lord.

308
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,654
I'm looking at spending the rest of my life

309
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,573
being treated like a fool and a eunuch
by my own people.

310
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:09,536
Ask yourself, is there anything I wouldn't do
to stop that from happening?

311
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,790
The hounds will find the scent again.
I'll beat them until they do.

312
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:17,377
I'll whip every man here
until I have both those boys in hand.

313
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,130
And once I've got them,
the pampered little shits...

314
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,634
it's better to be cruel than weak.

315
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,177
Prince Theon.

316
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,638
- Where are they?
- Who, m'lord?

317
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,974
The Stark boys. Where are they?

318
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,392
I don't know. I seen no one.

319
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:35,603
Think harder.

320
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:39,399
I swear, m'lord. I don't know.

321
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:42,277
My lord, over here.

322
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,324
I think I've found what we're looking for.

323
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,170
Send the old man home.

324
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,260
Go back to Winterfell.

325
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:09,012
Take him back.

326
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,641
Theon, don't do this.

327
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,080
- You came back.
- As soon as I heard.

328
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,874
Do you know anything?

329
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:41,711
- Irri is dead.
- I know.

330
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,048
- She was a good...
- She's dead.

331
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:49,260
She died alone.
She died for me and I couldn't protect her.

332
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,055
Doreah?

333
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,182
We can't find her.

334
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,227
She must be dead, too.

335
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:02,023
I led my people out of the Red Waste
and into the slaughterhouse.

336
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,025
I should have been here.

337
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:06,986
You went to find me a ship.

338
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,864
My place is by your side.

339
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,200
I shouldn't have left you alone
with these people.

340
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,285
"These people"?

341
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,287
They are not to be trusted.

342
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,039
And who is to be trusted?

343
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,708
Who are my people?

344
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,961
The Targaryens?

345
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,838
I only knew one, my brother,

346
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:28,383
and he would have let a thousand men
rape me if it had got him the crown.

347
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,718
The Dothraki?

348
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:34,597
Most of them turned on me the day
that Khal Drogo fell from his horse.

349
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:36,516
Your people are in Westeros.

350
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,102
The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.

351
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,146
- They will soon enough.
- And then what?

352
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,314
They'll pray for my return?

353
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,733
They'll wave dragon banners
and shout my name?

354
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,154
That's what my brother believed
and he was a fool.

355
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,573
You are not your brother.

356
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,408
Trust me, Khaleesi.

357
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,660
There it is.

358
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,745
"Trust me."

359
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,082
And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah?

360
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:02,667
Only you?

361
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,298
I don't need trust any longer.

362
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,885
I don't want it and I don't have room for it.

363
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:16,055
- You are too young to be so...
- And you are too familiar.

364
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:22,937
Forgive me, Khaleesi.

365
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:28,902
No one can survive in this world
without help. No one.

366
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,821
Let me help you, please.

367
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,449
Tell me how.

368
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,203
Find my dragons.

369
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:48,504
How long till we
get back to your crows?

370
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:52,133
We're close.

371
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,969
What, a day? A half-day?

372
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,726
You don't know, do you?

373
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:05,230
- Do you even know where they are?
- We're close.

374
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:09,192
What do you think they'll say
when they hear about you and me?

375
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,277
Nothing happened between you and me.

376
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,822
"I swear it, Old Master King Crow, ser,

377
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,242
"we were only close together for warmth.

378
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:21,829
"And then I felt it,
right up against me backside like a club.

379
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,457
"I can show you the bruise on me tailbone.

380
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,752
"And before I knew what was where,
his... his...

381
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,630
"Well, it was all out in the open,
all angry as you like.

382
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:34,384
"And I didn't want to want it, but oh, I did!

383
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,679
"And he spread me legs and ruined.

384
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,472
"The shame of it.

385
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,641
"Now I can never marry a perfumed lord.

386
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,352
"What will me poor savage father say?"

387
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:45,687
Turn back around.

388
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,605
"And I thought that we were done,
but he said,

389
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,691
"'Turn back around."'

390
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:52,860
I'll tell you what, Jon Snow.

391
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,905
Since it's gonna be your word against mine,

392
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,741
and since you can't
talk about it without blushing,

393
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,202
we may as well just...

394
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:04,455
What, right here in the muck?

395
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,208
I'll keep you warm enough.

396
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,087
Are you that afraid of it?

397
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:13,172
That's enough.

398
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:14,882
It's nice

399
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,801
and wet

400
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:18,553
and warm.

401
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:19,887
Enough!

402
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,932
It don't have teeth.

403
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
All right!

404
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:34,902
All right.

405
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,031
Gods, you're dull.

406
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,611
Should have took me
while you had the chance.

407
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,124
No, no!

408
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,187
No. Oh, no.

409
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,164
It's all right. Give me that.

410
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:14,252
If the Queen sees,
I can have Joffrey's children now.

411
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,003
Help me flip it over.

412
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,565
- Where are you going?
- To tell Her Grace.

413
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,944
You'll say nothing to anyone.

414
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,112
Do you understand?

415
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,636
Your mother might have prepared you.

416
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,722
You flowered, my dear. No more.

417
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:11,392
My mother told me,
but I thought it would be different.

418
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:12,477
In what way?

419
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,438
I thought it would be less...

420
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,065
Less messy.

421
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:21,277
Wait until you birth a child.

422
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,949
You're a woman now.
Do you have any idea what that means?

423
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:30,036
I'm fit to bear children for the king?

424
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,830
A prospect that once delighted you,

425
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:35,333
bringing little princes and princesses
into the world,

426
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,586
the greatest honor for a queen.

427
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,384
Joffrey has always been difficult.

428
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:50,848
Even his birth, I labored a day and a half
to bring him into this world.

429
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:52,099
You cannot imagine the pain.

430
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,729
I screamed so loudly, I was sure
Robert would hear me in the Kingswood.

431
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:59,398
His Grace was not with you?

432
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:00,650
Robert was hunting.

433
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:02,985
That was his custom.

434
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,115
Whenever my time was near,

435
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:15,081
my royal husband would flee to the trees
with his huntsmen and his hounds.

436
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:20,419
And when he returned, he would present me
with some pelts or a stag's head,

437
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,588
and I would present him with a baby.

438
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,385
Not that I wanted him there, mind you.

439
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:31,472
I had Grand Maester Pycelle,
an army of midwives, and I had my brother.

440
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,476
When they told Jaime
he wasn't allowed in the birthing room,

441
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:37,311
he smiled

442
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:40,648
and asked which one of them
proposed to keep him out.

443
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,612
Joffrey will show you no such devotion.

444
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,534
You may never love the king,

445
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:53,494
but you will love his children.

446
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:56,455
I love His Grace with all my heart.

447
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,667
That's so very touching to hear.

448
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:09,010
Permit me to share some womanly wisdom
with you on this very special day.

449
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:12,305
The more people you love,
the weaker you are.

450
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,934
You'll do things for them
that you know you shouldn't do.

451
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:20,771
You'll act the fool to make them happy,
to keep them safe.

452
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,985
Love no one but your children.

453
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,362
On that front, a mother has no choice.

454
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,951
But shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace?

455
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,372
You can try,

456
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,542
little dove.

457
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:00,061
Who did you say your mother was again?

458
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:02,146
Cinda Lannister.

459
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:03,648
Is she the fat one?

460
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:06,692
Well, perhaps she's
gotten a little larger than she...

461
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:09,987
No, no. There's only one fat Lannister.

462
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,490
If she was your mother, you'd know it.

463
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:17,453
I squired for you once, you know.

464
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:20,581
When?

465
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,834
The tournament,
the day of Willem Frey's wedding.

466
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,004
I went to Willem Frey's wedding?

467
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:28,464
You did.

468
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,301
Your squire had gotten so drunk
the night before that he threw up.

469
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:35,971
He threw up on his horse on the way to
the tourney grounds. What was his name?

470
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:38,557
Bryan.

471
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:40,768
Poor lad.

472
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,688
That was my brother's doing, I seem to recall.

473
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:47,525
I remember you.

474
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,445
You'd never squired for anyone before.

475
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,657
That's right. I ran up and volunteered.
"Let me, my lord. Let me."

476
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,494
My father was furious.

477
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:03,332
Afraid I'd embarrass our family
in front of the Family.

478
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,794
You didn't, though.

479
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:08,921
You really remember?

480
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:13,300
You knew when you were needed
and when to go away. it's a rare talent.

481
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,137
Most of my squires,

482
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:20,891
they mean well, but young men with big jobs,
they tend to overdo them.

483
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,811
- When I think back to that day...
- Shh!

484
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:34,321
You were saying?

485
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:35,865
I...

486
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:39,952
Never mind. it's embarrassing.

487
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:44,415
More embarrassing than being chained
to a post covered in your own shit?

488
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:48,169
I remember everything about that day,

489
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,379
your helmet, your horse,

490
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:53,507
the rake lines in the dirt along the list,

491
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:57,595
where the sun was in the sky when
you knocked Balon Swann from his horse,

492
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:00,514
and the dent in your shield
when you handed it back to me.

493
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:04,727
I'll remember it all until I die.

494
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,023
That was the best day of my life.

495
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:15,738
And I remember being on the field
after it was over.

496
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:19,241
All the competitors were done.
I was the last one out there.

497
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:22,828
And I couldn't leave.

498
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:28,501
I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my
family at a table so far on the edge of the feast

499
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,461
you could barely even see the bride.

500
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:34,590
And I couldn't bear to tell them
what it had been like squiring for you,

501
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:38,093
when I knew that they could never have
the faintest idea what I was talking about.

502
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,597
I understand completely.

503
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,848
How could you?

504
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,395
Sorry, I... l didn't mean to doubt you.
It's just that I...

505
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,730
I was 16 once.

506
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,610
I also had to replace someone's squire
on short notice.

507
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,237
Which knight was it?

508
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,280
Barristan Selmy.

509
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:03,536
The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws.
Before your time.

510
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:06,539
What was he like?

511
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:11,001
He was...

512
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,171
A painter.

513
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:18,467
A painter who only used red.

514
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:26,892
I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that,
not back then.

515
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:32,106
And to help him do that,
to be a part of something that perfect.

516
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:36,652
I don't need to explain how that felt,
not to you.

517
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,697
It's hard to put into words.

518
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:41,031
It's like

519
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:45,953
stepping into a dream you've been dreaming
for as long as you can remember,

520
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,955
and finding out that the dream

521
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,249
is more real than your life.

522
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,462
Leaving that battlefield was

523
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,632
like being dragged off to prison.

524
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:01,969
- Did you squire for him again?
- No.

525
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:04,597
I didn't have your gift.

526
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,393
He couldn't take a step
without stepping on me.

527
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,353
I was awful, a complete liability.

528
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:19,528
Until one of the outlaws decided
to take on a 16-year-old squire.

529
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,745
It's a good thing I am who I am.

530
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:31,457
I'd have been useless at anything else.

531
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:39,465
I'm not well-suited for imprisonment.

532
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,008
Shocking, I know.

533
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:42,843
Some men are.

534
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,803
Ned Stark,

535
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:49,475
I imagine he made an excellent prisoner
right up until the end.

536
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,602
Not me, though.

537
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:55,814
My life has left me
uniquely unfit for constraint.

538
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,569
And have you thought about...

539
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:02,404
Of course. Every day.

540
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,281
And?

541
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:10,079
Good prisoners breed good jailers,
apparently.

542
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,247
The Starks are very careful.

543
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,210
But there is a way, I think.

544
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,297
It wasn't possible until now.

545
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:22,716
What is it?

546
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:31,058
- It's actually quite simple.
- Well, let me help you.

547
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,560
You'll only have to do one thing.

548
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:34,979
Tell me.

549
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,067
You'll have to die.

550
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,205
Jorah the Andal.

551
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:39,084
This man must sail past old Valyria.

552
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:43,630
All who travel too close to the doom
must have protection.

553
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,549
I didn't come here for lessons.

554
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,885
No, you came for the dragons.

555
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:49,595
You have them?

556
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,931
Where are they?

557
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,808
Draw your sword.

558
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:58,479
See what your steel is worth.

559
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:04,193
You want to please the Mother of Dragons.

560
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,201
You love her.

561
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,706
Where are the dragons?

562
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,585
Will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal?

563
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:29,009
Will you betray her again?

564
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:32,888
Never.

565
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:40,896
The thief you seek

566
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,732
is with her now.

567
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:52,783
I did not leave the comfort of my home
to come to yours and be called a thief.

568
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,701
No one is calling you a thief.

569
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:56,578
Who is she to accuse us?

570
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:59,790
Please, they're my children. I'm begging you.

571
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:03,669
Begging us? it wasn't very long ago
you were threatening us.

572
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:06,046
Without me, the dragons will die.

573
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:07,881
It will be for the best.

574
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:12,970
Your dragons will bring the world
nothing but death and misery, my dear.

575
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,848
If I knew where they were,
I would not tell you.

576
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:17,599
You are cruel, my friend.

577
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,602
The Mother of Dragons is in the right.

578
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,647
She must be reunited with her babies.

579
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,734
- I will help you, Khaleesi.
- How?

580
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:32,906
I will take you to the House of the Undying
where I have put them.

581
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,493
You have my dragons?

582
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:41,540
When I learned you were coming to our city,
I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth.

583
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:45,002
He procured them for me.

584
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,588
But there is no King of Qarth.

585
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:50,090
There is now.
That was the other half of the arrangement.

586
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:58,432
You would keep your gates and your minds
closed to everything outside your walls,

587
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:03,604
but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city
that ever was if it refuses to change.

588
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:08,609
I will open Qarth to the world
as I have forced it to open itself to me.

589
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,446
Your ambition is an inspiration.

590
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,283
But like all upstarts, you overreach.

591
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:21,580
Three dragons the size of cats
and an alliance with a charlatan

592
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,582
do not make you a king.

593
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,043
An upstart and a charlatan?

594
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:28,503
Empires have been built by less.

595
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:33,050
Those on the margins
often come to control the center,

596
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:36,887
and those in the center make room for them,
willingly or otherwise.

597
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,478
The Mother of Dragons
will be with her babies.

598
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,775
She will give them her love
and they will thrive by her side,

599
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:54,863
forever.

600
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,135
A mother should be with her children.

601
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,849
Where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn?

602
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,770
Your dragons wait for you
in the House of the Undying.

603
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:28,689
Come see them.

604
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,908
- Lady Stark!
- No farther.

605
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:41,952
Keep your hands off me, woman.

606
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:45,163
Don't enter without an invitation, man.

607
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,750
Forgive me. Lady Stark.

608
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:51,420
- What is it?
- They caught the Kingslayer.

609
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,592
Kingslayer!

610
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:59,761
- Kill the fucking Kingslayer! Hang him!
- Hang him!

611
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,059
You'll die today.

612
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:07,936
Justice for the Karstark.

613
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:22,659
Gut him!

614
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,758
Get back! I want his head!

615
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:43,972
Any man who stands between a father
and his vengeance asks for death.

616
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:45,557
Lord Karstark,

617
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:48,769
this man is our prisoner.

618
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:51,146
This monster killed my son.

619
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:52,773
And crippled mine.

620
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:57,027
He will answer for his crimes,
I promise you, but not here.

621
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,446
I will have his head.
And if you try and stop me...

622
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,947
You will strike me down?

623
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,909
Have you forgotten me, ser?

624
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:06,828
I am the widow of your liege,
Lord Eddard Stark.

625
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,205
I am the mother of your king!

626
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:10,624
- And where is our king now?
- You know very well.

627
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,918
He has gone to the Crag
to accept the surrender.

628
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:16,463
Aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate.

629
00:45:16,798 --> 00:45:19,466
- He brought that foreign bitch with him.
- How dare you!

630
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,552
- Threatening my lady is an act of treason.
- Treason?

631
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:24,763
How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?

632
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:28,392
I understand your grief, my lord,
better than most, I understand it.

633
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:32,521
But in the name of my son,
the King in the North,

634
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,022
stand down.

635
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:39,778
When your son returns,
I will demand this murderer's head.

636
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:42,322
Wise men do not make demands of kings.

637
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:44,825
Fathers who love their sons do.

638
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:47,327
I will have his head.

639
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:52,958
Thank you for fighting on my behalf,
Lady Stark.

640
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:55,252
I would have come to your defense, but...

641
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,587
Take him to the stockades.

642
00:45:57,672 --> 00:45:59,589
Bind him with every chain you can find!

643
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:01,716
You've become a real she-wolf
in your later years.

644
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,802
There's not much fish left in you.

645
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,303
And gag him!

646
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,311
Since when do you light your own candles?

647
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:18,358
Since I decided that I can't stand to look at
any of my handmaidens for another instant.

648
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:23,196
How many times
can you read one raven scroll?

649
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:29,786
Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted
sailing north past Tarth, 200 ships.

650
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:33,290
- More than we have.
- Yes, that's more than we have.

651
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:37,961
He'll be at our gates within five days,
four if he has the wind.

652
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,172
We have strong, high walls.

653
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:43,592
We'll rain fire down on them from above.

654
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:48,054
"Rain fire on them from above."
You're quoting Father, aren't you?

655
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:49,514
Why not?

656
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,349
He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?

657
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,144
Call it tactics, not strategy.

658
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,480
But, yes, he does have a good mind for it.

659
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:59,774
The best mind, some would say.
Sadly, he's not here.

660
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,111
It's just you, me and Joffrey,

661
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:07,240
the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

662
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:10,911
I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.

663
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:13,580
He needs to start acting like a king.

664
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:17,167
This war you started
is coming to our doorstep.

665
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,794
And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead...

666
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:22,214
I'm not the one
giving the boy whores to abuse.

667
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:24,508
I thought the girls might help him.

668
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,468
- Did you?
- I was wrong.

669
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:31,765
If we can't control him...

670
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,642
Do you think I haven't tried?

671
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,188
He doesn't listen to me.

672
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:45,946
It's hard to put a leash on a dog
once you've put a crown on its head.

673
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,160
I always hoped he'd be like Jaime.

674
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:55,705
He looks like him.

675
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,461
In a certain light.

676
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:06,925
The boy is more Robert than Jaime.

677
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:10,470
Robert was a drunken fool,
but he didn't enjoy cruelty.

678
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,308
Sometimes I wonder.

679
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:17,227
What?

680
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,647
If this is the price

681
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,567
for what we've done,

682
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,777
for our sins.

683
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:27,654
Sins?

684
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,031
The Targaryens...

685
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:32,784
Wed brother and sister
for hundreds of years, I know.

686
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:38,999
That's what Jaime and I would say
to each other in our moments of doubt.

687
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:42,586
It's what I told Ned Stark
when he was stupid enough to confront me.

688
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:47,799
Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they?

689
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:49,467
What's the saying?

690
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:52,679
"Every time a Targaryen is born,
the Gods flip a coin."

691
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,265
You've beaten the odds.

692
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,853
Tommen and Myrcella are good,
decent children, both of them.

693
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,635
- Then why wait?
- We're sworn to the king.

694
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:34,054
- There's not a king.
- That's treason.

695
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:36,139
So is saving Lannisters, yeah?

696
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,058
- Back off, you.
- No, I won't.

697
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:41,728
Your son returns at dawn, my lady?

698
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,271
So they say.

699
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:45,106
The Kingslayer won't last the night.

700
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,818
The more they drink, the angrier they'll get.

701
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:51,946
And when the Karstarks draw their swords...

702
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,241
Who wants to die defending a Lannister?

703
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:57,744
Come.

704
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:05,960
He'll not be making it through the night.

705
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,304
I need to be alone with him.

706
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:20,141
- My lady, our orders...
- Your orders, which I just gave you,

707
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:22,519
are to leave me alone with him.

708
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:29,776
Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark?

709
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:33,446
I believe it's my last night in this world.

710
00:50:34,907 --> 00:50:36,074
Is that a woman?

711
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,493
Do you hear them out there?

712
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:40,787
They want your head.

713
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:45,375
Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.

714
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,294
You strangled his son with your chains.

715
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:50,130
Oh. Oh.

716
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:52,340
Was he the one on guard duty?

717
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,678
He was in my way.

718
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:59,806
- Any knight would have done the same.
- You are no knight.

719
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:03,226
You have forsaken every vow you ever took.

720
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,811
So many vows.

721
00:51:05,146 --> 00:51:06,813
They make you swear and swear.

722
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:11,151
Defend the king, obey the king,
obey your father,

723
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:14,154
protect the innocent, defend the weak.

724
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:17,532
But what if your father despises the king?

725
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:21,661
What if the king massacres the innocent?

726
00:51:22,455 --> 00:51:23,788
It's too much.

727
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:27,959
No matter what you do,
you're forsaking one vow or another.

728
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,587
Where did you find this beast?

729
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:34,758
She is a truer knight than you will ever be,

730
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:38,470
- Kingslayer.
- Kingslayer.

731
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,056
What a king he was.

732
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,769
Here's to Aerys Targaryen,
the Second of His Name,

733
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:48,897
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
Protector of the Realm,

734
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,150
and to the sword I shoved in his back.

735
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,654
You are a man without honor.

736
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:00,241
Do you know,

737
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:03,703
I've never been with any woman but Cersei.

738
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:05,955
So in my own way,

739
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,666
I have more honor than

740
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,170
poor old dead Ned.

741
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,216
What was the name of
that bastard he fathered?

742
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,343
- Brienne.
- No, that wasn't it.

743
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:23,139
Snow, a bastard from the North.

744
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:29,270
Now, when... When good old Ned
came home with some whore's baby,

745
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:32,023
did you pretend to love it?

746
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:34,734
No.

747
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:37,570
You're not very good at pretending.

748
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:39,614
You're an honest woman.

749
00:52:40,533 --> 00:52:42,826
You hated that boy, didn't you?

750
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,787
How could you not hate him?

751
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,248
The walking, talking reminder

752
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:52,043
that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark

753
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,045
fucked another woman.

754
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:58,508
Your sword.

755
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,349
I told you what would happen.

756
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:09,269
All of you.

757
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,898
I told you what would happen
if you served me loyally.

758
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,527
And what would happen if you did not.

759
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:20,655
What are you doing? What have you done?

760
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:24,576
If there are any who still question
whether your new lord means what he says,

761
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,455
here is the answer to your question.

762
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,968
No!

1
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,794
- Riders approaching!
- Open the gate!

2
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:38,032
Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell.

3
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,661
- Envy isn't attractive.
- What envy?

4
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,747
You should be proud
of your brother's achievement.

5
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:47,333
I took the great castle of Winterfell
with 20 men.

6
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,210
You're a great warrior.

7
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,838
I saw the bodies above your gates.

8
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:56,175
Which one gave you the tougher fight,
the cripple or the six-year-old?

9
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:01,681
I treated the Stark boys with honor,
and they repaid me with treachery.

10
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,934
You treated them with honor?
By butchering them?

11
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,269
Before I had to kill them,

12
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,146
- I treated them...
- You seized their home, as is your right.

13
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,940
We're ironborn, we take what we need.

14
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,024
Exactly.

15
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:15,194
Then you made them prisoners in their home
and they ran away.

16
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:16,946
Is that treachery?

17
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,282
I'd call it bravery.

18
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,869
- They made me a promise...
- Your little boy prisoners made you a promise

19
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,580
and you got mad when they broke it?

20
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,248
Are you the dumbest cunt alive?

21
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,958
- Don't call me...
- A cunt.

22
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:32,920
A dumb cunt who killed
the only two Starks in Winterfell.

23
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,464
You know how valuable those boys were?

24
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,384
If I hadn't killed them,
the Northerners would think me weak.

25
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,220
You are weak. And you're stupid.

26
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,305
I'm warning you.

27
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,684
Go on, then. Warn me.

28
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,357
You haven't brought enough men.

29
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:55,651
How am I supposed to
defend Winterfell with just this lot?

30
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:56,736
You're not.

31
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,906
I've come to bring you home.
Father wants a word.

32
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,657
Is this a joke?

33
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,075
Winterfell is the heart of the North.

34
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,120
Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea.

35
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,082
We're islanders, baby brother.
Had you forgotten that?

36
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,002
Our power comes from our ships.

37
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,547
And now that you've decorated your walls
with the bodies of the Stark boys,

38
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:19,842
every man in the North wants
to see you hanged.

39
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,346
- When Robb Stark finds out...
- He won't find out.

40
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,972
We've killed all the ravens.

41
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:27,016
We have all the horses.

42
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:30,269
I've taken Winterfell.

43
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,564
And I will keep Winterfell.

44
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:37,944
Leave us.

45
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,751
Theon, you're my blood.

46
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,588
We both loved our mother.

47
00:04:57,673 --> 00:05:00,383
We both endured our father.

48
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,845
Come home with me. Don't die here alone.

49
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,889
I don't intend to die.

50
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,397
You were a terrible baby, do you know that?

51
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,068
Bawling all the time, never sleeping.

52
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,072
And one night, you just wouldn't shut up,

53
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,366
screaming like a dying pig.

54
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:30,746
I walked over to your crib,
I looked down at you.

55
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,957
I wanted to strangle you.

56
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:37,461
And you looked up at me
and you stopped screaming.

57
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,339
You smiled at me.

58
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,138
Don't die so far from the sea.

59
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:05,364
I've brought you a present, Lord of Bones.

60
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:09,702
I already got one crow. Don't need two.

61
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,954
Mance will want to question this one.

62
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,457
Knows all about where the crows are
and what they're planning.

63
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:18,210
The Half hand knows more.
This one is just a little boy.

64
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,336
Gut him.

65
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,298
He could have killed me half a dozen times.

66
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,674
And now he wishes he did.

67
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,384
Gut him.

68
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,846
He's a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Stark's son.

69
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:34,268
Mance will want him.

70
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,730
What does Mance want
with a dead man's bastard?

71
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,065
I don't know.

72
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,276
I think he'll want to decide for himself.

73
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,078
He runs, I'll chop his balls off.

74
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,789
He runs, I'll do it meself.

75
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:04,799
We're even now, Jon Snow.

76
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,939
I couldn't do it.

77
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,108
I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't...

78
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,359
I know.

79
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,736
The others?

80
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:28,614
When you didn't come back,
we went looking for you.

81
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,158
We found your tracks fast enough.

82
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,911
But they found us before we found you.

83
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,247
They died because of me.

84
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,708
See that it wasn't for nothing.

85
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:40,918
All right, up, lad.

86
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,212
Come on, on your feet, now.

87
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,547
Move it.

88
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,513
Is she beautiful?

89
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,307
I've never met her.

90
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,434
What's her name?

91
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,563
Frey, I suppose. I don't know her first name.

92
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,400
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

93
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,864
And you're marrying her for a bridge?

94
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,699
- An important bridge.
- Ah.

95
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,911
It was before they killed my father.

96
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,373
I still thought I could march south
and rescue him in time,

97
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,917
but only if I crossed that bridge.

98
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,672
When I speak to people from the North,

99
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,966
they all loved your father.

100
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,511
He was the best man I ever met.

101
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:35,264
I know children always think that
about their fathers, but...

102
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:39,435
Children do not always think that
about their fathers, believe me.

103
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:44,982
He once told me
that being a lord is like being a father,

104
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:49,612
except you have thousands of children
and you worry about all of them.

105
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,615
The farmers plowing the fields
are yours to protect.

106
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,784
The charwomen scrubbing the floors,
yours to protect.

107
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,454
The soldiers you order into battle.

108
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:04,710
He told me he woke with fear in the morning
and went to bed with fear in the night.

109
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,755
I didn't believe him.

110
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:13,135
I asked him,
"How can a man be brave if he's afraid?"

111
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,307
"That is the only time a man can be brave,"
he told me.

112
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,437
I wish I could have met him.

113
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,482
He would have liked you.

114
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,528
Most lords worry more about their gold
and their glory

115
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,364
than the charwomen scrubbing their floors.

116
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,825
- He didn't care much about gold or glory.
- And you?

117
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:41,288
You think I'm fighting this war
so they'll sing songs about me?

118
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,415
I want to go home.

119
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,878
- I want the men following me to go home.
- Then why don't you?

120
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:51,757
Because we'll never be safe
until the Lannisters are defeated.

121
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,926
And because I believe in justice.

122
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,388
- Chopping off Joffrey's head, you mean.
- That would be a start.

123
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,108
Your Grace, milady.

124
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,569
The Kingslayer, he escaped in the night.

125
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:17,449
How?

126
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,872
Tell me this isn't true.

127
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:29,962
Why?

128
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,257
For the girls.

129
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,508
- You betrayed me.
- Robb...

130
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,718
No!

131
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:39,596
You knew I would not allow it
and you did it anyway.

132
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:44,143
Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell.

133
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:47,271
Sansa and Arya are
captives in King's Landing.

134
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,940
I have five children,
and only one of them is free.

135
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:53,902
I lost one son fighting by your son's side.

136
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,573
I lost another to the Kingslayer,
strangled with a chain.

137
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:02,411
You commit treason
because your children are prisoners?

138
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:06,790
I would carve out my heart
and offer it to the Father,

139
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:11,295
if he would let my sons wake
from their graves and step into a prison cell.

140
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,839
- I grieve for your sons, my lord.
- I don't want your grief.

141
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,966
I want my vengeance.

142
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,260
And you stole it from me.

143
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,766
Killing Jaime Lannister
would not buy life for your children,

144
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,519
but returning him to King's Landing
may buy life for mine.

145
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,856
Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool.

146
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,193
You've weakened our position.

147
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,903
You've brought discord into our camp.

148
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,490
And you did it all behind my back.

149
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,371
- Make sure she's guarded day and night.
- Robb.

150
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,831
How many men did we send
in pursuit of the Kingslayer?

151
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:48,999
Forty, Your Grace.

152
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:52,086
Send another 40 with our fastest horses.

153
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,670
Robb.

154
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,523
Damn.

155
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,487
You're much uglier in daylight.

156
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,239
What's your name?

157
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:25,119
I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock,
son of Tywin.

158
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,582
A captive knight has
a right to know his captor's identity.

159
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,251
Brienne of Tarth.

160
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,336
Tarth, Tarth, Tarth.

161
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,047
Crescent moons and starbursts.

162
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,715
Lord...

163
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,885
Selwyn Tarth. Your father.

164
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,057
Do you have any brothers and sisters,
my lady?

165
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:51,270
It's a long way to King's Landing.
Might as well get to know one another.

166
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,398
Have you known many men?

167
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,607
I suppose not.

168
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,401
Women?

169
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,485
Horses? Ah.

170
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,948
I didn't mean to give offense, my lady.
Forgive me.

171
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,576
Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer.

172
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,203
Why do you hate me so much?
Have I ever harmed you?

173
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,874
You've harmed others,
those you were sworn to protect,

174
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,293
the weak, the innocent.

175
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:17,504
Has anyone ever told you
you're as boring as you are ugly?

176
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,132
You will not provoke me to anger.

177
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,843
I already have. Look at you.

178
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,428
You're ready to chop my head off.

179
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,389
Do you think you could?

180
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,183
Do you think you could beat me
in a fair fight?

181
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,143
I've never seen you fight.

182
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,936
The answer is no.

183
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,482
There are three men in the kingdoms
who might have a chance against me.

184
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,066
You're not one of them.

185
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,570
All my life men like you have sneered at me.

186
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,490
And all my life I've been
knocking men like you into the dust.

187
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,701
If you're so confident, unlock my chains.
Let's see what happens.

188
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,497
Do you take me for an idiot? In!

189
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,878
I took you for a fighter, a man...

190
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,547
Pardon. Woman of honor.

191
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,467
Was I wrong?

192
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,135
You're afraid.

193
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,015
Maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer.

194
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:27,324
King's Landing will fall
an hour after Stannis lands his force.

195
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:33,830
It's not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei
and the court to ride west to safety.

196
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,124
Surrender the lron Throne?

197
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,419
Better than seeing their heads mounted
on the city gates.

198
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,755
Stannis will execute them all.

199
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,217
No, a king who runs will not be king for long.

200
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,761
He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight.

201
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:53,850
Stannis, two days from the capital
and the wolf at my doorstep.

202
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:57,980
The scouts assure us
Robb Stark remains north ofAshemark.

203
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,732
Ha! The last time the scouts assured us
of Stark's movement,

204
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,317
he lured us into a trap.

205
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,822
Which is why my son is his prisoner.

206
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,327
Too close to Casterly Rock.

207
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:17,291
He sent a splinter force
to recapture Winterfell.

208
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,002
The Greyjoys have done us a great favor.

209
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,881
Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock
until he's at full force.

210
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,175
He's a boy and he's never lost a battle.

211
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,013
He'll risk anything at any time

212
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:34,391
because he doesn't know enough to be afraid.

213
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,192
We'll ride at nightfall.

214
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,195
I want a full night's march
before he knows we're on the move.

215
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:51,283
Clegane, you'll maintain
a garrison here at Harrenhal.

216
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,202
Track down this brotherhood
and destroy them.

217
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,833
The girl has proven herself a good servant.

218
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,169
She'll stay on with you.

219
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,212
See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings.

220
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:09,468
He's poor company when he's sober,
but he's better at his work.

221
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,269
You've got some
questions to answer.

222
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,229
Who killed Ser Amory?

223
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,815
- I don't know! Please!
- Give me the name.

224
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,861
- Take this one out for the crows.
- I told you, I don't know.

225
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,113
Please.

226
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,575
Look, it's Yoren's little cunt.

227
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,453
Used to be a boy, now it's a girl.

228
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,080
Where's Jaqen?

229
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,665
Don't care.

230
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,751
Where's your stick now, bitch?

231
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,461
I promised to fuck you with it.

232
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,172
Come on, time to kill some wolves.

233
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,725
You need sour cherries to make it right.

234
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,895
And the secret is you dry the stones,
and then you break them with a mallet.

235
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,232
That's where the real flavor is.
You crush 'em up real fine.

236
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,484
And then when you're finished,
you sprinkle them over the piecrust.

237
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,568
Where's Jaqen?

238
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,445
- How would I know?
- I need him now.

239
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,116
- Lord Tywin's marching tonight.
- You need him?

240
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,951
He's helping me.

241
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,120
- I saw him.
- Where?

242
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,041
- Where? Where?
- Ow!

243
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:25,377
They went riding out the gates
a few hours ago.

244
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,628
On patrol.

245
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,839
Let go of my ears.

246
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,595
What do you want with him anyway?

247
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,321
Mance is gonna march on the Wall.

248
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:57,659
When he does, one brother inside his army
will be worth 1,000 fighting against it.

249
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,828
- They'll never trust me.
- They might.

250
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,705
- If you do what needs to be done.
- What?

251
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,416
How does it feel
knowing those men all died

252
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,586
so you could skip through the snow
with your little savage girl?

253
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,254
- I didn't.
- I should have known better,

254
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,339
trusting a traitor's bastard.

255
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,430
He's not yours to kill, crow.

256
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,704
Do you have to do that here?

257
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,000
I like to keep me hands clean.

258
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,337
Yes, but do you have to do it here?

259
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,972
You should start wearing the gold cloak.

260
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,516
I don't want to wear a gold cloak.

261
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,643
You're commander of the City Watch.

262
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:08,271
- You shouldn't be dressed like a common...
- A cloak slows you down in a fight.

263
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,524
Makes it hard to move quietly.

264
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:14,319
And the gold catches the light,
so you're nice and easy to spot at night.

265
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,614
Well, you're not
sneaking through alleyways any longer.

266
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:18,907
You're supposed to stand out.

267
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,077
We had a deal
and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.

268
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,787
Fine, fine.

269
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,415
No gold cloak.

270
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,258
What?

271
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,009
- What?
- What? What?

272
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,469
Why are you staring at me?

273
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,974
You don't want me cleaning me nails.
You don't want me looking your way.

274
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,142
Why am I here?

275
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,395
To help me plan
the defense of King's Landing.

276
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,773
Stannis will be here any day.

277
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,112
And one of these explains how to beat him?

278
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,700
"An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros."

279
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:04,077
By Archmaester Shevelathin.

280
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,621
Shevelatesh.

281
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,206
Chevalteesh.

282
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,546
I'd swap all your books
for a few good archers.

283
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,673
My Lord Hand. Commander.

284
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:20,176
I must compliment you
on the gold cloaks' performance

285
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,386
these last few weeks.

286
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:25,724
Did you know there has been
a marked drop in thievery?

287
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,351
I did not know.

288
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,771
And how did you accomplish
this marked drop in thievery?

289
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,983
Me and the lads rounded up
all the known thieves.

290
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,944
For questioning?

291
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:39,195
No.

292
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,699
It's just the unknown thieves
we need to worry about now.

293
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,744
- We talked about this.
- Aye, we talked about it.

294
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,914
Have you ever been in a city under siege?

295
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,499
Maybe this part's not in your books.

296
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,461
See, it's not the fighting
that kills most people. it's the starving.

297
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:57,213
Food's worth more than gold.

298
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,967
Noble ladies sell their diamonds
for a sack of potatoes.

299
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:04,304
Things get bad enough,
the poor start eating each other.

300
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,515
The thieves, they love a siege.

301
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,518
Soon as the gates are sealed,
they steal all the food.

302
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:14,314
By the time it's all over,
they're the richest men in town.

303
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:19,861
Given the circumstances, my lord,
I believe extreme measures are warranted.

304
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,072
Ah.

305
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,283
"The Great Sieges of Westeros."

306
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:27,452
Thrilling subject.

307
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:31,665
Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan
wasn't a better writer.

308
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,421
Stannis knows King's Landing.

309
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,800
He knows where the walls are strongest,

310
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:45,178
and he knows which gates are weakest.

311
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,766
The Mud Gate.

312
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,103
A good ram will batter it down in minutes,

313
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,522
and it's only 50 yards from the water.

314
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,399
That's where he'll land.

315
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:00,193
And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate,

316
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,070
what is our plan?

317
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,781
We could throw books at his men.

318
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,241
We don't have that many books.

319
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,742
We don't have that many men, either.

320
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,912
What do we have?

321
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,873
Pig shit.

322
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,394
I'm not cut out for this sort of work.

323
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:38,481
I always imagined meself
doing something much worse.

324
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:41,276
We're digging latrine pits
at the end of the world.

325
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,319
I can't imagine anything much worse.

326
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,239
You lack imagination.

327
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:50,702
Where do you think Jon is right now?

328
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,580
He went off with the Half hand.
He didn't come back.

329
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,623
A betting man would go with dead.

330
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:58,752
He's not dead.

331
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:00,879
No, Jon's a great fighter.

332
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,132
Well, he's better than me
and a lot better than you.

333
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,302
He's got a Valyrian steel sword.

334
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:09,679
So did his father.

335
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,557
And Qhorin Half hand
is the greatest ranger alive.

336
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,435
Great rangers never get old is the problem.

337
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,270
Shit ones neither.

338
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,316
It's them in the middle that last a long time.

339
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:28,615
What in seven hells is that?

340
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,633
The First Men made these marks.

341
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,343
Help me with it.

342
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,024
Look.

343
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,697
If you find something you're not supposed to,

344
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:13,076
best thing to do
is pretend you've never seen it.

345
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,161
That's a Night's Watch cloak.

346
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:16,913
It's been here a long time.

347
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:23,378
Oh.

348
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,296
Must be dragonglass.

349
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,756
Dragonglass?

350
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,425
The maesters call it obsidian.

351
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:32,971
Why would a brother hide it here?

352
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,891
I expect it's 'cause
he wanted somebody to find it.

353
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,440
Mind where you're going.

354
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,701
I'm sorry. I'll...

355
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,662
Where were you?

356
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,997
A man has patrol duty.

357
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,875
Tywin Lannister was right here,
and now he's gone.

358
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,918
A girl owes one more name.

359
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,004
The Red God demands it.
Give the man a name.

360
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:11,593
How long after I give you the name
does it take you to kill someone?

361
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:14,512
A minute, an hour, a month.

362
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:17,599
Death is certain,

363
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,351
the time is not.

364
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,687
He's taking his army to attack my brother.

365
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,814
I need him dead right now.

366
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,275
This a man cannot do.

367
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:30,111
You promised you'd help me.

368
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:33,198
Help was not promised, lovely girl.
Only death.

369
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:37,493
There must be others. Give a name, any name.

370
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,370
And you'll kill them?

371
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,456
Anybody?

372
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,545
By the Seven New Gods
and the Old Gods beyond counting,

373
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,214
I swear it.

374
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:53,635
All right.

375
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:00,975
Jaqen H'ghar.

376
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,484
A girl gives a man his own name?

377
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,153
- That's right.
- Gods are not mocked.

378
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,739
- This is no joking thing.
- I'm not joking.

379
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,282
A man can go kill himself.

380
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:17,742
Un-name me.

381
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,244
- No.
- Please?

382
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:22,997
I'll un-name you.

383
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,876
- Thank you.
- If you help me and my friends escape.

384
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:30,755
This would require more than one life.

385
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,925
- This is not part of our bargain.
- Fine, Jaqen H'ghar.

386
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:35,885
A girl lacks honor.

387
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:47,063
If I do this thing, a girl must obey.

388
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,856
A girl will obey.

389
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:54,862
A girl and her friends will
walk through the gate at midnight.

390
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,910
Thank you, Podrick.

391
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,210
Odd little boy.

392
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,713
I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.

393
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,173
You and Varys both.

394
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,303
Excellent lamprey pie.

395
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:21,472
Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day?

396
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,766
I hear Joffrey plans on fighting.

397
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:26,185
An inspiration for the troops.

398
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,895
The young king in his shining armor

399
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,648
fighting to defend the capital
against the wicked old rebel.

400
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:32,608
He's only a boy.

401
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:35,403
Younger boys are off fighting his war.

402
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,573
- He's not ready.
- What is he, 17?

403
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,951
- Remember Jaime at 17?
- Better than you.

404
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:45,038
Some men have a gift for this sort of thing,

405
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,956
some don't.

406
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,750
His place is not on the battlefield.

407
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,002
It's not on the throne, either,

408
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,837
sadly for all of us.

409
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,176
Do you think I'm an idiot?

410
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,511
No, I'd say you possess
above-average intelligence.

411
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:03,014
You shipped off my only daughter.

412
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,100
And now you want to send my eldest son
to the battlefield to die.

413
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,519
He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him.

414
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:11,522
He has the finest armor gold can buy.

415
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:13,191
He needs to be out there.

416
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:16,861
The men will fight more fiercely
seeing their king fighting beside them

417
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,489
instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts.

418
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:21,908
Any dessert?

419
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,495
Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?

420
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,873
Because he has
thousands of spies in his employ.

421
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,751
Because he knows everything we do
before we do it.

422
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,211
Because he doesn't have a cock.

423
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,546
Neither do you.

424
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,717
Perhaps I'm dangerous, too.

425
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:43,846
You, on the other hand,
are as big a fool as every other man.

426
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:47,725
That little worm between your legs
does half your thinking.

427
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,477
It's not that little.

428
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:57,735
Why are you smiling?

429
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,821
Because I'm happy.

430
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:01,864
And why are you happy?

431
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:08,538
Because I have your little whore.

432
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:13,584
I thought you preferred blondes.

433
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,420
Such a droll little fellow.

434
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,255
Tell me, have you married this one yet?

435
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,298
No?

436
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,135
Good. Father will be so pleased.

437
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,262
Why do you care who I fuck?

438
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,931
Because a Lannister always pays her debts.

439
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,474
You stole my only daughter,

440
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,184
you plot to have Joffrey killed.

441
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:33,229
This is madness. Stannis will be here in days.

442
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,605
- You need me.
- For what?

443
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,524
Your skill in battle?

444
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,528
Pretty thing, your whore.

445
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,947
Lovely body.

446
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,741
The bruises will heal in time.

447
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:48,995
Where did you find her?

448
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,330
Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers.

449
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:54,250
Really, a Lannister lion necklace?

450
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,962
You need to hide your secret whores
more carefully.

451
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,923
You've forgotten the most
important thing about whores.

452
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,008
Oh?

453
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:05,511
Well, you're the expert. Tell me.

454
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,556
You don't buy them,

455
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,475
you only rent them.

456
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,270
You're usually a better liar, baby brother.

457
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,772
This one you like.

458
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,734
You like her very much.

459
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:21,986
Could it be love?

460
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:25,907
Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough.

461
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,492
Unless Joffrey is hurt.

462
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:30,870
And then every wound he suffers,
she'll suffer, too.

463
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:32,914
And if he dies,

464
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:38,836
there isn't a man alive who could devise
a more painful death for your little cunt.

465
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:45,176
And how do I know
you haven't killed her already?

466
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,469
Would you like to see her?

467
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,179
I thought you might.

468
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:51,140
Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore.

469
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:25,550
I'm sorry they hurt you.

470
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:28,761
You must be brave.

471
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:36,477
I promise I will free you.

472
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,772
Don't forget me.

473
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:41,649
Never.

474
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,336
I will hurt you for this.

475
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:06,424
A day will come
when you think you're safe and happy,

476
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:10,011
and yourjoy will turn to ashes in your mouth.

477
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,097
And you will know the debt is paid.

478
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,017
Get out.

479
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,155
Shae!

480
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,493
I've been waiting all night.

481
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,162
What is wrong?

482
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,164
You're beautiful.

483
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,382
Then why do you look sad?

484
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,099
We have to be more careful.

485
00:32:57,184 --> 00:33:00,102
Don't be afraid. I can take care of myself.

486
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,731
There are people who want to hurt me.

487
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,775
I know. I won't let them.

488
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,569
I'll cut off their faces. I will.

489
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,743
I would kill for you. Do you know that?

490
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:20,498
I expect I'll have to before this is over.

491
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:24,752
You're mine.

492
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,047
I'm yours.

493
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,675
Promise me.

494
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,681
I'm yours, and you are mine.

495
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,653
Still no word?

496
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:54,281
We've sent a dozen ravens.
None have returned.

497
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:59,203
My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell.

498
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,330
- Once he captures the castle...
- Theon has my brothers.

499
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:05,126
- If we storm the castle...
- He wouldn't dare hurt the boys.

500
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:10,297
They're his only hope
of escaping the North with his head.

501
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:13,634
Send word to your son.

502
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:19,598
Any ironborn who surrender will be allowed
to return safely to their homes.

503
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:23,185
A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace.
Too much...

504
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,939
Any ironborn with the exception
of Theon Greyjoy.

505
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,067
He betrayed our cause.

506
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,820
He betrayed me.

507
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,614
And we will hunt him down
no matter where he runs.

508
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,909
I expect his countrymen will turn on him
the minute they hear the offer.

509
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,790
Your pardon, my lord. Your Grace.

510
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,292
My lady.

511
00:34:58,472 --> 00:34:59,972
How are you?

512
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,184
How am I?

513
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,436
I've had to arrest my mother.

514
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,605
The Lannisters have my sisters.

515
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:10,357
The man I considered my closest friend

516
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,651
has seized my home and my brothers.

517
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:15,529
I'm fighting a war and I don't know
if I should march south or north.

518
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,908
I'm sorry. it was a stupid question. I'm sorry.

519
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:20,367
No.

520
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,827
Forgive me.

521
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,704
You're being kind.

522
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,916
- I have no right.
- You have every right.

523
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,334
You're a king.

524
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:30,503
That's not the kind of king I want to be.

525
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:33,130
What kind do you want to be?

526
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,215
I don't know.

527
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,716
The good kind.

528
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,388
Most kings grew up as princes.

529
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:44,767
They spend their whole lives
preparing for the crown.

530
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,478
I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.

531
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,107
I was raised to be a proper little lady,

532
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:57,321
to play the harp and dance the latest steps
and recite Valyrian poetry.

533
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,739
I'd like to hear you play the harp.

534
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:00,866
No. No, you would not.

535
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:09,250
How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry

536
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:12,127
to sawing off men's feet?

537
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:24,348
When I was 12,

538
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,059
my mother and father went to a wedding.

539
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:30,312
Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know.

540
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:33,107
And they left me with my little brother.

541
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:38,320
The second afternoon they were gone
was the hottest day in the three-year summer.

542
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:43,075
We couldn't bear to be inside,
so we ran down to the Rhoyne.

543
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:46,453
Every child in Volantis
was in the Rhoyne that day.

544
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,957
The rich, the poor, we were all there.

545
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,419
Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands.

546
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,922
Drummers were playing
for coppers on the east bank.

547
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,553
I was treading water,

548
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,514
talking to a friend,

549
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,726
when I realized I hadn't seen my brother.

550
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,353
I called his name.

551
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:15,149
Then I started screaming his name.

552
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,485
And then I saw him...

553
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,488
floating face down.

554
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,993
My heart just... stopped.

555
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,453
I was...

556
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,001
I dragged him from the water.

557
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,962
My friend helped me, I think.

558
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:39,006
I don't even remember.

559
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,344
He was so little.

560
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,473
Then we pulled him onto the riverbank.

561
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:52,436
And I screamed at him and I shook him.

562
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,814
And he was dead.

563
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,984
Just dead.

564
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,615
A man ran over.

565
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,620
He had a fish tattoo on his face.

566
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,582
In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos.

567
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:17,044
So you know what they are
without having to talk to them.

568
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:20,130
And this man worked on a fishing boat.

569
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:22,633
And he pushed me out of the way.

570
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:28,347
You have to understand,
for a slave to push a highborn girl,

571
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,558
that's death for the man, a terrible death.

572
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:35,312
But he pushed me out of the way,

573
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:40,734
and he started pressing on my brother's chest

574
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:44,321
again and again and again,

575
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:48,492
until my brother spat out

576
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:52,079
half of the Rhoyne and cried out.

577
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,791
And the man cradled his head
and told him to be calm.

578
00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:04,675
I decided two things that day.

579
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:10,264
I would not waste my years planning dances
and masquerades with the other noble ladies.

580
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,767
And when I came of age,

581
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,188
I would never live in a slave city again.

582
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:26,947
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

583
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:30,367
You told me of your problems
and I've blathered on.

584
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:33,203
I don't want to marry the Frey girl.

585
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,125
I don't want you to marry her.

586
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,298
But you needed that bridge.

587
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,969
I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.

588
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:57,454
The sour cherries
was all crushed up and ready.

589
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:58,622
Shut up.

590
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,542
Probably in the piecrust by now.
In the oven.

591
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,044
The nice, warm oven.

592
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:06,255
Shut up. What did you bring?

593
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,133
The cheese could be better.

594
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:10,676
I did get some nice sausages.

595
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,303
What did he want us
to do about those guards?

596
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:14,888
He didn't say.

597
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,640
He just said, "Walk through the gates."

598
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:17,850
What about the guards?

599
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,810
He didn't say anything about the guards.

600
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,478
What, he left that bit out?

601
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:23,105
It's a pretty important part, don't you think?

602
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,274
We have to trust him.

603
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:26,441
Trust him?

604
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:29,653
You trusted him to fight with us
when you set him free and he ran.

605
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,697
- I want to go back to the kitchens.
- Shut up.

606
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,074
Stay here if you're afraid.

607
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,453
Arry, don't.

608
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:08,400
Away!

609
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,776
Reset!

610
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:21,121
If the wind holds,
we'll reach King's Landing in a day.

611
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:22,539
Will it hold?

612
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:25,918
Can't make promises for the wind,
Your Grace.

613
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,378
Again, pull!

614
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,218
I admire you, Ser Davos.

615
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:37,512
I thank you, Your Grace. Pleased to hear it.

616
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:41,558
Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight
and think they insult you.

617
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:43,894
So you take the onion for your sigil,

618
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,396
sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag.

619
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:48,440
My son wishes me to change it.

620
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:51,818
Three mermen with tridents,
something like that.

621
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:55,906
I understand why
the older families look down at me.

622
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,908
Do you? Why?

623
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,953
- My father was a crabber.
- And?

624
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:05,040
Well, sons of lords don't like
to break bread with sons of crabbers.

625
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,583
Our hands stink.

626
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:09,044
And where were those lords
when Storm's End starved?

627
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,546
Many fought bravely for your brother.

628
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:14,258
Many fought for the Mad King.

629
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:17,719
You defend these men
who insult you behind your back.

630
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:20,472
Some are happy to do it to my face.

631
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,432
We were forgotten.

632
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:25,227
Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes.

633
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:29,398
The glorious rebels
marching from battle to battle,

634
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:31,692
liberating towns
from the yoke of the Mad King,

635
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:34,111
while I held Storm's End with 500 men.

636
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,613
- No one has forgotten, Your Grace.
- No? Robert did.

637
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:39,908
He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war.
Renly never fought a day in his life.

638
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:43,537
- He was only a boy.
- Then why'd he give him Storm's End?

639
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,834
First, we ate the horses.

640
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:52,462
We weren't riding anywhere,
not with the castle surrounded.

641
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:54,631
We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses.

642
00:43:54,716 --> 00:43:57,968
Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine.

643
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,803
I do like dogs.

644
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:03,432
Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them.
Then the rats.

645
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:07,644
The night before you slipped through,
I thought my wife was dying.

646
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:09,938
She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail.

647
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,483
And then you made it through the lines.

648
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:16,820
Slipped right through
in your little black sailboat with your onions.

649
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,656
And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe.

650
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:21,992
Every man in Storm's End wanted
to kiss you that night.

651
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,369
I was relieved they did not.

652
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:29,916
Robert told me to hold Storm's End,
so I held it.

653
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:34,421
Then he told me he was giving it to Renly,
so I gave it up.

654
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,215
Insult or no, I gave it up.

655
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,176
Because Robert was my older brother,
and he was the king

656
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,345
and I've always done my duty.

657
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:45,682
But now, I'm the rightful king
by every law of Westeros.

658
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:47,809
And when I sit the lron Throne,
you'll be my Hand.

659
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,564
Your Grace,

660
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,943
I pray I serve you well.

661
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:00,781
I expect you'll be the first crabber's son
to wear the badge.

662
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:09,289
You're the Master of Whisperers.
You're supposed to know everything.

663
00:45:09,374 --> 00:45:12,334
No man can be in all rooms at all times.

664
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,212
I have many little birds in the North, my lord,

665
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:19,716
but I haven't heard their songs
since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell.

666
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:23,595
The Stark forces are distracted.
Now is the time to strike.

667
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,305
To strike?

668
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:29,017
My dear nephew, you do see these men
preparing the walls for siege?

669
00:45:29,102 --> 00:45:32,646
You do understand
Stannis Baratheon sails this way?

670
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,023
If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores
of King's Landing,

671
00:45:35,108 --> 00:45:36,900
I'll ride out to greet him.

672
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,819
A brave choice, Your Grace.

673
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:41,655
I'm sure your men will line up behind you.

674
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:44,991
They say Stannis never smiles.

675
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:47,494
I'll give him a red smile

676
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,287
from ear to ear.

677
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,294
Imagine Stannis' terror.

678
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:58,839
I am trying.

679
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:01,925
You're an intelligent man.

680
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,635
I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.

681
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:07,514
Oh, no one disputes that, my lord,
not even the multitudes who despise you.

682
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:10,517
I wish we could converse
as two honest, intelligent men.

683
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,185
I wish we could, too.

684
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,356
What do you want?

685
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,150
Tell me.

686
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:22,362
If we're going to play, you'll have to start.

687
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,704
My brother was
the youngest Kingsguard in history.

688
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:34,749
My sister became queen at the age of 19.

689
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:38,670
When I reached manhood,

690
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:42,507
my father put me in charge of all the drains
and cisterns in Casterly Rock.

691
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,759
A most highborn plumber.

692
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,803
The water never flowed better.

693
00:46:46,888 --> 00:46:49,639
And all the shit found its way to the sea.

694
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,726
I never expected to have any real power.

695
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,728
So when my father named me acting Hand...

696
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,730
You're quite good at being Hand, you know?

697
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,900
Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men.

698
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:01,985
Honorable men.

699
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,863
But they disdained the game
and those who played.

700
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,199
- You enjoy the game.
- I do.

701
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:09,868
Last thing I expected.

702
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,286
And you play it well.

703
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,497
I'd like to keep playing it.

704
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:19,127
If Stannis breaches the gates,
the game is over.

705
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:23,131
They say he burns his enemies alive
to honor the Lord of Light.

706
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,009
The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned,

707
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,678
the Drowned God wants them drowned.

708
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:30,597
Why are all the gods such vicious cunts?

709
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:34,309
Where is the god of tits and wine?

710
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:39,105
In the Summer lsles,
they worship a fertility goddess with 16 teats.

711
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,108
We should sail there immediately.

712
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:46,363
This morning, I heard a song

713
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:50,283
all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste.

714
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,285
Daenerys Targaryen lives.

715
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:57,249
A girl at the edge of the world
is the least of our problems.

716
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:59,251
She has three dragons.

717
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,338
But even if what they say is true,

718
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,299
it'll be years before they are fully grown.

719
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:09,636
And then there will be nowhere to hide.

720
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,347
One game at a time, my friend.

721
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,901
Careful, Khaleesi.

722
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:29,447
Xaro owns this city and the warlocks
have a thousand eyes watching for you.

723
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,367
I found one.

724
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:35,453
A ship with a good captain.

725
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:37,247
She leaves for Astapor tomorrow.

726
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,707
Astapor?

727
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:40,041
We cannot stay here.

728
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:43,253
They have my dragons.
A mother does not flee without her children.

729
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,297
They're not your children.

730
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:49,134
I know they call you the Mother of Dragons
and I know you love them,

731
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:50,760
but you didn't grow them in your womb.

732
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:53,305
They didn't suckle at your breast.
They are dragons, Khaleesi.

733
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,807
And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die.

734
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:59,519
You should sail to Astapor.
I'm sure you'll be safe there.

735
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,940
You know I would die for you.

736
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,319
I will never abandon you.

737
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:09,404
I'm sworn to protect you, to serve.

738
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,531
Then serve me.

739
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:15,160
If my dragons are in
the House of the Undying, then take me there.

740
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:17,120
That's what the warlock wants.

741
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,830
He told you so himself.

742
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:21,708
If you enter that place,
you will never leave again.

743
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,794
- His magic is strong.
- And what of my magic?

744
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:27,881
You saw me step into the fire.
You watched the witch burn.

745
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:31,176
What did the flames do to me?
Do you remember?

746
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:35,930
Until my last breath, I will remember.

747
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:40,727
After I have forgotten my mother's face.

748
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,317
They are my children.

749
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:51,863
And they are the only children I will ever have.

750
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,746
Take me to them.

751
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:13,885
We should bury them.

752
00:50:14,637 --> 00:50:17,931
I'd leave 'em up a few more days.
Sends a message.

753
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:21,267
If they haven't got the damn message yet,
a few more days won't help.

754
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,978
As you say.

755
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:27,232
But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer.

756
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:31,111
- What's this?
- Gold for the farmer.

757
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:33,238
For his trouble.

758
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:35,240
His troubles are done.

759
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,702
He's feeding the crops now.

760
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,453
His wife, too.

761
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:45,709
You want to keep a man silent,
you silence him.

762
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:07,981
Got as far
as the farm and then doubled back.

763
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:13,611
Walked through the stream
to throw off the hounds.

764
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:19,159
Hoped this would be the last place
they'd think to look.

765
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,787
You're right

766
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:24,330
so far.

767
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:29,169
Who was that
out there hung up at the gates?

768
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,590
Must have been the farmer's boys.

769
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:37,051
He killed them and burned them

770
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:41,431
and passed them off as the little lords?

771
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,517
They mustn't know.

772
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:48,354
Bran would blame himself.

773
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:50,315
They'll never hear it from me.

774
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:54,569
The little lads have suffered enough.


1
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,591
That's it.

2
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,751
The tide's against us.

3
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,169
Aye, but we have the wind.

4
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,381
She'll blow us straight to the gates.

5
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,549
You're coming home.

6
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,552
King's Landing hasn't been home
for 20 years.

7
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:44,765
I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet.

8
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:49,186
And now I'm sailing right at them.

9
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,439
This is the royal fleet.

10
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,441
And you're not a smuggler anymore,
you're the high captain.

11
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:56,694
Of course, there are...
several royal fleets at the moment.

12
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,820
Not after tonight.

13
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,616
When the sun rises,
Stannis will sit on the lron Throne

14
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,159
and you will be his Hand.

15
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,994
- Gods be good.
- God.

16
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,246
Father, there is only one
and he watches over us.

17
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,498
- But not over them?
- Over all of us.

18
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,544
The people of King's Landing did not
choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon.

19
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,047
They will be glad to see his head on a spike.

20
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,799
Well, first, we have to put it there.

21
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,719
Our ships outnumber theirs 10-to-1.

22
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,471
Our army outnumber theirs 5-to-1.

23
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,765
Those walls have never been breached,

24
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:27,975
and the men guarding the walls,

25
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,187
when they see you, they don't see a liberator,

26
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,273
they see a stranger come
to set their city on fire.

27
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,109
I have faith in the Lord of Light.

28
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,236
I have faith in our cause.

29
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,031
And I have faith in my captain.

30
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,068
Are you afraid, my lion?

31
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:27,827
If the city falls, Stannis will
burn every Lannister he can find.

32
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,081
Of course I'm afraid.

33
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,169
I won't let them hurt you.

34
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,467
I'm a Lannister.

35
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,262
I don't have a choice in all this.

36
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,598
But it's not your war.

37
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,273
It is now.

38
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,488
You can't fuck your way out of everything.

39
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,658
I have so far.

40
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,956
Do you remember what you said
when you met me in your tent?

41
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:20,171
That I should make love to you
like it was your last day on this earth.

42
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,643
As you know, Your Grace,

43
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,563
it is not only the sworn duty of a maester

44
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,691
to carry out the wishes
of the house he serves,

45
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:43,527
but also to offer guidance

46
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,781
and counsel in times of war.

47
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,408
Your words are always wise and measured.

48
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,911
- If you could...
- If anything,

49
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:55,915
a maester's duties become more urgent

50
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,335
in times of war and turmoil.

51
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,756
I remember back in the days of King...

52
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,382
You brought me something?

53
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,426
Yes.

54
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,224
Essence of nightshade

55
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:17,311
is as dangerous as it is efficacious.

56
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,856
A single drop in a cup of wine

57
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:24,693
suffices to soothe ragged nerves.

58
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:29,490
Three drops will bring on
a deep and dreamless sleep.

59
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,618
Ten drops, however...

60
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,453
I know what ten drops will bring.

61
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,914
Your Grace, if I may ask...

62
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,374
You may not.

63
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,920
You must have a lot of work to do.

64
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,548
I'm sure many brave men
will need your wisdom soon.

65
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:50,302
Yes. A siege is very...

66
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,555
Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester.
There are so many.

67
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,518
Your Grace.

68
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,982
And so he spoke

69
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:08,070
That Lord of Castamere

70
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:13,075
But now the rains weep o'er his halls

71
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,496
With no one there to hear

72
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:22,710
Yes, now the rains weep o'er his halls

73
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:28,340
And not a soul to hear

74
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:32,261
- Good boys!
- Lannisters!

75
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,180
Where'd you learn the Lannister song?

76
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,931
Drunk Lannisters.

77
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,894
You've got a pretty voice.

78
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,896
Thank you very much.

79
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,230
And I like your nose.

80
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,941
How many times you break it?

81
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,570
Well, now let's see.

82
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,990
First time, I was five.

83
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,368
- My mam smacked me with an iron poker.
- Oh.

84
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,371
It wasn't me she was aiming at.

85
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,332
She was trying for my little brother.

86
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,708
Now he was a real pest.

87
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,961
Second time, I was nine.

88
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,798
Got in a scrap with a few older boys.

89
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,467
They won.

90
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,510
Third time...

91
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,022
Eh, you don't want to know
about the third time.

92
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,151
Poor nose.

93
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,779
Don't feel sorry for him.

94
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,698
He'll be halfway up your arse
before the night's through.

95
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,336
Welcome, friends.

96
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,050
This round's on me.

97
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,478
I don't think he likes me.

98
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,576
You think you're a hard man?

99
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,163
I know it.

100
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,254
It's warm in here.

101
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,798
We've got beautiful women

102
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,216
and good brown ale.

103
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,719
Plenty for everyone.

104
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,929
And all you want

105
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:41,640
is to put one of us in the cold ground

106
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,518
with no women to keep us company.

107
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,937
Oh, there's women in the ground.

108
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,981
I put some there myself.

109
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,233
So have you.

110
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:55,195
You like fucking and drinking

111
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:56,989
and singing.

112
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,701
But killing,

113
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,121
killing's the thing you love.

114
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,207
You're just like me.

115
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,087
Only smaller.

116
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:16,175
And quicker.

117
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,427
Eh?

118
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:23,223
Your Lord lmp's going to miss you.

119
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,190
Aye...

120
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,819
I expect he will someday.

121
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,659
Here we are.

122
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,507
One more drink before the war?

123
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,550
Shall we?

124
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,231
I've always hated the bells.

125
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,024
They ring for horror.

126
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:16,735
A dead king, a city under siege.

127
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,570
- A wedding.
- Exactly.

128
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,950
Podrick, is that it?

129
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,244
"Is that it?" Nice touch.

130
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:28,705
As if you don't know the name
of every boy in town.

131
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,583
I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.

132
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,878
I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure
what I'm suggesting.

133
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,297
Do you trust him?

134
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,511
Oddly enough, I do.

135
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,347
Good.

136
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,896
The map you asked for.

137
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:00,112
There must be 20 miles of tunnels
beneath the city.

138
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,822
Closer to 50.

139
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:05,451
The Targaryens built this city
to withstand a siege

140
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:08,871
and to provide escape if necessary.

141
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:10,998
I'm not escaping.

142
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,250
Strange as it sounds,
I'm the captain of the ship,

143
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,877
and if the ship goes down, I go with her.

144
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,920
That is good to hear.

145
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:21,341
Though I'm sure many captains say the same
while their ship is afloat.

146
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,053
You look well suited for battle, my lord.

147
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,597
Well, I'm not.

148
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,516
For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong.

149
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,519
My little birds tell me

150
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:36,899
that Stannis Baratheon has taken up
with a red priestess from Asshai.

151
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,817
What of it?

152
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:42,196
You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?

153
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,407
Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting.
What do you think?

154
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:49,036
I think you believe in what you see

155
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,581
and in what those you trust have seen.

156
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,919
You probably don't entirely trust me.

157
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,046
Mmm, don't take it personally.

158
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,672
I don't entirely trust myself.

159
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,550
And yet I have seen things

160
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,053
and heard things,

161
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,932
things you have not, things I wish I had not.

162
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,480
I don't believe I've ever told you
how I was cut.

163
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,108
No, I don't believe you have.

164
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,946
One day, I will.

165
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:29,910
The dark arts have
provided Lord Stannis with his armies

166
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,371
and paved his path to our door.

167
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:37,543
For a man in service to such powers
to sit on the lron Throne,

168
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,836
I can think of nothing worse.

169
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,422
And tonight,

170
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:46,260
I believe you are the only man
who can stop him.

171
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,414
They're welcoming the new king.

172
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,708
I've never known bells to mean surrender.

173
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,253
They want to play music with us? Let's play.

174
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,089
- Drums.
- Drums!

175
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,283
Remember, wait till the ships...

176
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,534
The ships are in the bay.

177
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,787
- They must be far enough in...
- I know what "in" means.

178
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,081
- Do you know how to use that?
- I chopped wood once.

179
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,626
No, I watched my brother chopping wood.

180
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,586
I saw you kill a man with a shield.

181
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,212
You'll be unstoppable with an ax.

182
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,342
- Don't get killed.
- Nor you, my friend.

183
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:11,386
- Oh, are we friends now?
- Of course we are.

184
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,098
Just because I pay you for your services
doesn't diminish our friendship.

185
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:16,308
Enhances it, really.

186
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,977
Oh! "Enhances." Fancy word for a sellsword.

187
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,855
Been spending time with fancy folks.

188
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:36,078
Lady Sansa and Sheila.

189
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,247
- Shae.
- Shae, yes.

190
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,460
Surely my sister has asked you to join the
other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast.

191
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,922
She has, my lord,
but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off.

192
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,383
Sansa.

193
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,218
Always been a great romantic, my nephew.

194
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,928
Sansa, come here.

195
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,766
I will pray for your safe return, my lord.

196
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,687
- Will you?
- Just as I pray for the king's.

197
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,943
Stay safe, my lady.

198
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,653
And you, my lion.

199
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,744
Your king rides forth to battle.

200
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,872
You should see him off with a kiss.

201
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,041
My new blade.

202
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,793
Hearteater, I've named it.

203
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:28,839
Kiss it.

204
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,600
You'll kiss it again when I return

205
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,477
and taste my uncle's blood.

206
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,187
Will you slay him yourself?

207
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,816
If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.

208
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,819
So you'll be outside the gates
fighting in the vanguard?

209
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:55,866
A king doesn't discuss battle plans
with stupid girls.

210
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:59,161
I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid.

211
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,747
Of course you'll be in the vanguard.

212
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,958
They say my brother Robb always goes
where the fighting is thickest.

213
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,835
And he is only a pretender.

214
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,503
Your brother's turn will come.

215
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,591
Then you can lick his blood
off Hearteater, too.

216
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,814
Some of those boys will never come back.

217
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:29,357
Joffrey will.

218
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,985
- The worst ones always live.
- Shh.

219
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,738
Come, my lady.

220
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,537
Where's our fleet?

221
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:24,621
On the way.

222
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,666
Why isn't it here now? They're coming.

223
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:33,421
Hound, tell the Hand
that his king has asked him a question.

224
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,257
The king has asked you a question.

225
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,845
Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king
that the Hand is extremely busy.

226
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,848
The Hand of the King would like me
to tell you to tell the king...

227
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:46,017
if I tell the Hound to cut you in half,
he'll do it without a second thought.

228
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,061
That would make me the quarterman.

229
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,105
It just doesn't have the same ring to it.

230
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:54,234
Cut me in half and I won't be
able to give the signal.

231
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,569
No signal, no plan.

232
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:59,155
No plan and Stannis Baratheon
sacks this city, takes the lron Throne,

233
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,158
puts your pinched little head
atop a gate somewhere.

234
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,828
It might be quite amusing,

235
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,496
except that my head would be up there, too.

236
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,623
I've never much liked my head,

237
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,626
but I don't want to see it removed just yet.

238
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,214
Where are their ships?

239
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:18,925
It was wise to attack at night.
We took them by surprise.

240
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,053
Lord Varys knows what you had
for breakfast three days ago.

241
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,680
There are no surprises here.

242
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,891
If it's true there is dissension in their ranks,

243
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,726
maybe their sailors have mutinied.

244
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,352
Maybe.

245
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,829
I don't know why she wants me here.

246
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,790
She's always saying how stupid I am.
She hates me.

247
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:54,294
Maybe she hates you less than
she hates everyone else.

248
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,630
I doubt it.

249
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,299
Maybe she's jealous of you.

250
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:01,718
Why would she be jealous?

251
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:03,345
Sansa.

252
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,851
I was wondering where
our little dove had flown.

253
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:12,854
You look pale, child.

254
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,482
Is your red flower still blooming?

255
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,275
Yes.

256
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,361
Fitting, isn't it?

257
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:23,281
The men will bleed out there
and you will bleed in here.

258
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,909
Pour Lady Sansa some wine.

259
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,452
I'm not thirsty, Your Grace.

260
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,996
So? I didn't offer you water.

261
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,711
What's he doing here?

262
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:38,588
Ser llyn?

263
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:41,299
He's here to defend us.

264
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,970
When the axes smash down those doors,
you may be glad to have him.

265
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:47,305
But we have guards to defend us.

266
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,974
Guards we have paid.

267
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:51,559
Should the city fall,
they'll be the first ones out of the doors.

268
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,984
The lads caught a groom and two maids
trying to sneak away

269
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:01,111
with a stolen horse and some gold cups.

270
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,947
The battle's first traitors.

271
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,573
Have Ser llyn see to them.

272
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:09,369
Put their heads on spikes
outside the stables as a warning.

273
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:13,289
The only way to keep the small folk loyal

274
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:16,501
is to make certain they fear you
more than they do the enemy.

275
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:20,588
Remember that if you ever
hope to become a queen.

276
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,676
You said he was here to protect us.

277
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:28,471
He is.

278
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,599
Traitors are a danger to us all.

279
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,309
More wine.

280
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,743
There they are.

281
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,958
- Archers to their marks.
- Archers, to your marks!

282
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,795
Archers!

283
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,094
Nock your arrows!

284
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,305
Nock arrows!

285
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,142
- Hold fast.
- Hold fast!

286
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,895
What are you doing? We need to attack them.

287
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,898
- Hold fast.
- Boulders ready!

288
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,776
Hold fast!

289
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:27,739
There's only one ship.
Where are the rest of them?

290
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,784
Where are the rest of them?

291
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,623
There's only one ship.

292
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,545
Archers, stand to!

293
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,130
Man the below!

294
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:46,424
- Nock.
- Nock and set!

295
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,135
Draw!

296
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,267
Hold.

297
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,019
Hold.

298
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:08,530
There's no one on board.

299
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:16,496
More rocks coming up!

300
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,013
Hold.

301
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,355
Wildfire.

302
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,275
Steer clear! Steer clear!

303
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,468
Matthos! Get down!

304
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:48,940
- Prepare to land.
- Your Grace.

305
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,067
The dwarf has played his little trick.

306
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,861
- The wildfire.
- He can only play it once.

307
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,114
We're too far from the gates.

308
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,408
The fire, their archers...

309
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,535
Hundreds will die.

310
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,246
Thousands.

311
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,429
Come with me and take this city!

312
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:40,116
Sansa, come here, little dove.

313
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,582
My queen.

314
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:49,917
What are you doing?

315
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,294
Praying.

316
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:54,172
You're perfect, aren't you?

317
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:55,506
Praying.

318
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:58,176
What are you praying for?

319
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,553
For the gods to have mercy on us all.

320
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,597
Oh.

321
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:03,973
On all of us?

322
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:06,100
- Yes, Your Grace.
- Even me?

323
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:08,269
Of course, Your Grace.

324
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:09,854
Even Joffrey?

325
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:15,526
- Joffrey is my...
- Oh, shut up, you little fool.

326
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,696
Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all.

327
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:20,865
The gods have no mercy.
That's why they're gods.

328
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:25,119
My father told me that
when he caught me praying.

329
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:29,040
My mother had just died, you see.

330
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:33,294
I didn't really understand
the concept of death, the finality of it.

331
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,547
I thought that if I prayed very, very hard,

332
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:39,509
the gods would return my mother to me.
I was four.

333
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:42,470
Your father doesn't believe in the gods?

334
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,931
He believes in them,
he just doesn't like them very much.

335
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:49,811
One for her.

336
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:54,941
Here.

337
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,319
Sit.

338
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,113
Drink.

339
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,493
Not like that. Drink, girl.

340
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,082
I should have been born a man.

341
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,126
I'd rather face a thousand swords

342
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,671
than be shut up inside
with this flock of frightened hens.

343
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:20,675
They are your guests under your protection.
You asked them here.

344
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:22,927
It was expected of me,

345
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:26,514
as it will be of you
if you ever become Joffrey's queen.

346
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,768
If my wretched brother
should somehow prevail,

347
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:33,855
these hens will return to their cocks

348
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:37,900
and crow of how my courage inspired them,

349
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,902
lifted their spirits.

350
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:41,821
And if the city should fall?

351
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,741
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

352
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,953
The Red Keep should hold for a time,

353
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:53,541
long enough for me to go to the walls
and yield to Lord Stannis in person.

354
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:56,377
If it were anyone else outside those gates,

355
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,379
I might have hoped for a private audience,

356
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,715
but this is Stannis Baratheon.

357
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:04,886
I'd have a better chance
of seducing his horse.

358
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,475
Have I shocked you, little dove?

359
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,227
Tears aren't a woman's only weapon.

360
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,940
The best one's between your legs.

361
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:20,735
Learn how to use it. Drink.

362
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:28,242
Do you have any notion of what happens
when a city is sacked?

363
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:31,746
No, you wouldn't, would you?

364
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,750
If the city falls, these fine women

365
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,086
should be in for a bit of a rape.

366
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:43,841
Half of them will have bastards
in their bellies come the morning.

367
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,261
You'll be glad of your red flower then.

368
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:52,266
When a man's blood is up,
anything with tits looks good.

369
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,605
A precious thing like you
will look very, very good.

370
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,733
A slice of cake

371
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,944
just waiting to be eaten.

372
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,114
More pressure!

373
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,419
- Pull! Pull!
- That's it, men!

374
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,923
Pull! Pull!

375
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,389
He's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon.

376
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,724
They're coming. They're coming ashore.

377
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,602
Rain fire on them.

378
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:38,521
Archers!

379
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,772
There are too many.

380
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,775
Hound, form a welcome party
for any Baratheon troop

381
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,694
that manages to touch solid ground.

382
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:49,740
Pod, run to the King's Gate.

383
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:52,368
Bring any men guarding it here, now.

384
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,536
Yes, my lord.

385
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:57,623
Let's go. Stannis is sending us fresh meat.

386
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,375
You, too.

387
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,713
Any of these flaming fucking arrows
come near me,

388
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:06,382
I'll strangle you with your own guts.

389
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:13,222
Pull, pull! Go!

390
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:14,557
Nock!

391
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,146
Draw!

392
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,523
- Draw!
- Draw!

393
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:34,410
Kill the Lannisters!

394
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,204
- Loose!
- Loose!

395
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:48,549
- Draw!
- Draw!

396
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:50,843
- Loose!
- Loose!

397
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,181
To the Mud Gate, go now!

398
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,768
First and second squads, to the gate!
To the Mud Gate!

399
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,062
Any man dies with a clean sword,

400
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,439
I'll rape his fucking corpse.

401
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:22,560
When we were young, Jaime and I,

402
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:26,564
we looked so much alike
even our father couldn't tell us apart.

403
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:30,234
I could never understand why
they treated us differently.

404
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:34,780
Jaime was taught to fight
with sword and lance and mace,

405
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,491
and I was taught to smile

406
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:39,452
and sing and please.

407
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:42,163
He was heir to Casterly Rock,

408
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:45,374
and I was sold to some stranger like a horse

409
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:47,376
to be ridden whenever he desired.

410
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:49,795
You were Robert's queen.

411
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,006
And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy.

412
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,179
I don't think I know this one.

413
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,436
Pretty.

414
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,861
That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen.

415
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,697
Here, it's not difficult.
I mastered it when I was four.

416
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,658
Straighten your back and bend.

417
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,497
Better. You learn fast.

418
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:28,334
How long have you been
in Lady Sansa's service?

419
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:31,962
A few weeks, Your Grace.

420
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,550
When did you leave Lorath?

421
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,554
I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.

422
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:46,352
But she was a nobleman's daughter.

423
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:47,603
You're not.

424
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,442
When did you come to Westeros?

425
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,654
Ten years ago, Your Grace.

426
00:35:57,447 --> 00:36:01,408
From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep
in 10 years,

427
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,370
all without learning how to curtsy.

428
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,456
I imagine that's a very interesting story.

429
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:09,959
What's your name?

430
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,419
Shae, Your Grace.

431
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,505
Tell us a story, Shae.

432
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:22,513
When I was 13, I...

433
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:25,975
Your Grace!

434
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,185
What news?

435
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:31,397
The lmp has set the river afire.

436
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:34,108
Hundreds of ships are burning, maybe more.

437
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,610
Stannis' fleet destroyed, but...

438
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:38,696
But...

439
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,616
But his troops
have landed outside the city walls.

440
00:36:43,285 --> 00:36:44,952
Where is Joffrey?

441
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,746
On the battlements with Lord Tyrion.

442
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:50,082
Bring him back inside at once.

443
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,459
- Your Grace...
- What?

444
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,296
The king's presence is good for morale.

445
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,090
Bring him back to his chambers now.

446
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,925
- Not here?
- With the women and children?

447
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,428
Do you want him to be mocked as a coward
for the rest of his life?

448
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:04,346
- No, but I...
- Now!

449
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:13,188
When I told you about Ser llyn earlier, I lied.

450
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,817
Do you want to hear the truth?

451
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,278
You want to know why he's really here?

452
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,656
He's here for us.

453
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:25,910
Stannis may take the city,
he may take the throne,

454
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:27,912
but he will not take us alive.

455
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:03,238
Help me!

456
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:26,428
- Fall back!
- Fall back!

457
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:35,980
Get the ladders up!

458
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:12,099
Faster, you bastards! Faster!

459
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,601
Come on, kill the scum!

460
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,689
Someone bring me a drink.

461
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:27,448
Fuck the water. Bring me wine.

462
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,294
Can I get you some iced milk

463
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,546
and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?

464
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:44,298
Eat shit, dwarf.

465
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,884
You're on the wrong side of the wall.

466
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,886
I lost half my men.

467
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,431
The Blackwater's on fire.

468
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,726
Dog, I command you to
go back out there and fight.

469
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:01,648
You're Kingsguard, Clegane.

470
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:04,318
You must beat them back or
they're going to take this city.

471
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,779
Your king's city.

472
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:09,823
Fuck the Kingsguard.

473
00:40:11,493 --> 00:40:12,618
Fuck the city.

474
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,204
Fuck the king.

475
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,807
Loose!

476
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:36,850
Put your backs into it!

477
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:39,019
All right, get up!

478
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:43,524
Loose!

479
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:44,691
Clear!

480
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,026
Forward!

481
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,737
Loose!

482
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,293
Forward ladders!

483
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,439
Heave!

484
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:26,108
Heave!

485
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:27,901
Your Grace,

486
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,988
the queen has sent me to
bring you back to the Red Keep.

487
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,742
If you won't defend your own city,
why should they?

488
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:37,870
What would you have me do?

489
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:39,288
Lead.

490
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:42,583
Get down there and lead your people
against the invaders who want to kill them.

491
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,503
What did my mother say exactly?
Did she have urgent business with me?

492
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:47,921
She did not say, Your Grace.

493
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,884
All men to the battlements!

494
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:55,637
Ser Boros, Ser Mandon,

495
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:59,349
stay with my uncle and represent the king
on the field of battle.

496
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:03,103
Archers, hold your line

497
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:04,771
or I'll kill you myself.

498
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,110
Stand fast!

499
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:20,746
No!

500
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,790
Get up, you fool.

501
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,667
We need more arrows!

502
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,839
Where is the king?

503
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:34,009
- Why isn't he with us?
- Who are we fighting for?

504
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,054
Who leads us?

505
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:38,931
I'll lead the attack.

506
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,308
I'll lead the attack!

507
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,519
- Yes.
- What are you talking about?

508
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:46,146
Pod, my helmet.

509
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,817
Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner.

510
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,361
Men, form up.

511
00:42:54,948 --> 00:42:56,031
Men...

512
00:42:57,659 --> 00:42:58,825
Men!

513
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:02,079
They say I'm half a man.

514
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,831
But what does that make the lot of you?

515
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,459
The only way out is through the gates.

516
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,919
And they're at the gates.

517
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,421
There's another way out.
I'm going to show you.

518
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:15,092
We'll come out behind them
and fuck them in their arses.

519
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,137
Heave!

520
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:20,973
Heave!

521
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,558
Don't fight for your king

522
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,936
and don't fight for his kingdoms.

523
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:29,606
Don't fight for honor. Don't fight for glory.

524
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:32,067
Don't fight for riches,
because you won't get any.

525
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:35,028
This is your city Stannis means to sack.

526
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:36,863
That's your gate he's ramming.

527
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:40,200
If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns,

528
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:43,203
your gold he steals,

529
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,706
your women he will rape.

530
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,210
Heave! Heave!

531
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:52,379
Heave!

532
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,050
Those are brave men knocking at our door.

533
00:43:58,553 --> 00:43:59,720
Let's go kill them.

534
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:24,870
The battle is lost, Your Grace.

535
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:28,165
Stannis' troops are at the gates.

536
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,959
When the gold cloaks saw the king leaving,

537
00:44:31,044 --> 00:44:33,086
they lost all heart.

538
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:34,588
Where is my son?

539
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,590
I want to escort him back to the battle.

540
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,425
Why do I care what you want?

541
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,927
- Bring me...
- Now listen to me...

542
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:51,521
Don't be afraid.
The queen has raised the drawbridge.

543
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,899
This is the safest place we can be.

544
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:56,860
Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely.

545
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,904
His knights have rallied behind him.

546
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:00,197
They will save the city.

547
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:02,866
Shall we sing a hymn?

548
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:08,288
Gentle mother, font of mercy

549
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:12,667
Save our sons from war, we pray

550
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:15,879
You must go.

551
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,465
Run to your chamber and bar your door.

552
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,593
Stannis won't hurt you. This one will.

553
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:27,391
- Come with me.
- I need to say goodbye to someone.

554
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,559
The queen said they'd rape everyone.

555
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:31,311
No one is raping me.

556
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,565
Go. Run.

557
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:16,898
The lady is starting to panic.

558
00:46:18,151 --> 00:46:19,609
What are you doing here?

559
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:21,528
Not here for long.

560
00:46:22,155 --> 00:46:23,905
- I'm going.
- Where?

561
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:27,242
Someplace that isn't burning.

562
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:30,996
North, might be.

563
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:32,914
Could be.

564
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,750
What about the king?

565
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,546
He can die just fine on his own.

566
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,304
I can take you with me.

567
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:50,307
Take you to Winterfell.

568
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:57,189
I'll keep you safe.

569
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,693
Do you want to go home?

570
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,948
I'll be safe here.

571
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,200
Stannis won't hurt me.

572
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:11,828
Look at me.

573
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,290
Stannis is a killer.

574
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,626
The Lannisters are killers.

575
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,337
Your father was a killer.

576
00:47:21,214 --> 00:47:23,215
Your brother is a killer.

577
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:26,760
Your sons will be killers someday.

578
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:31,556
The world is built by killers.

579
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:38,355
So you'd better get used to looking at them.

580
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,401
You won't hurt me.

581
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:52,744
No, little bird, I won't hurt you.

582
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,186
Heave!

583
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:26,736
Come on, you bastards! Get up those ladders!

584
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,325
Attack!

585
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:47,716
Roll it over!

586
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:59,019
Half man! Half man! Half man!

587
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,032
Oh, fuck me.

588
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:05,085
Shh!

589
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:08,004
Be calm, my sweet.

590
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:09,964
They're still fighting.

591
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:13,968
No one's going to hurt you.

592
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,724
I'll tell you a story.

593
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:23,311
You know the one about
the mother lion and her little cub?

594
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,606
- They lived in the woods.
- The Kingswood?

595
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:28,191
Yes, my love.

596
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:32,362
In the Kingswood,
there lived a mother and her cub.

597
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,322
She loved him very much.

598
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:39,369
But there were other things
that lived in the woods. Evil things.

599
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,787
Like what?

600
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,666
Like stags.

601
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,252
Stags aren't evil.

602
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:49,129
They only eat grass.

603
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,630
And wolves.

604
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:52,590
My lord.

605
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:54,676
He could hear them
howling in the night.

606
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,053
The little cub was frightened.

607
00:50:57,138 --> 00:51:01,433
His mother said, "You are a lion, my son.
You mustn't be afraid.

608
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:17,824
"For one day, all the beasts will bow to you.

609
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,576
"You will be king.

610
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:24,873
"All the stags will bow.
All the wolves will bow.

611
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:29,043
"The bears in the north
and the foxes of the south,

612
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:34,090
"all the birds in the sky
and the beasts in the sea,

613
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:38,887
"they will all come to you, little lion,

614
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,264
"to rest a crown upon your head."

615
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,147
And the cub said,

616
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:52,192
"Will I be strong and fierce like my father?"

617
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,528
"Yes," said his mother.

618
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:59,199
"You will be strong and fierce
just like your father."

619
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,554
I will keep you safe, my love.

620
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,556
I promise you.

621
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:34,526
Back to the boats!

622
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:38,404
Stand and fight!

623
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:42,492
Stand and fight, damn you!

624
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:44,786
No!

625
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:49,249
Father.

626
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:57,549
The battle is over. We have won.

627
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:11,938
"And who are you,"
the proud lord said

628
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:16,359
"That I must bow so low?"

629
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:21,948
"Only a cat of a different coat

630
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:26,452
"That's all the truth I know

631
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:32,125
"In a coat of gold or a coat of red

632
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:37,130
"A lion still has claws

633
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:42,218
"And mine are long and sharp, my lord

634
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:46,556
"As long and sharp as yours"

635
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:54,689
And so he spoke, and so he spoke

636
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:59,694
That Lord of Castamere

637
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:04,824
But now the rains weep o'er his hall

638
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:09,621
With no one there to hear

639
00:54:09,705 --> 00:54:15,084
Yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall

640
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:19,797
And not a soul to hear

1
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,394
Pod.

2
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,648
Pod!

3
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,194
Find Bronn or Varys.

4
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,739
Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle.

5
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,909
Tell them I am very much alive.

6
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:41,494
Yes, my lord.

7
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,582
Would you like something for the pain?

8
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,002
What happened?

9
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:53,089
The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon

10
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,884
suffered a stunning defeat
at the hands of your father.

11
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,888
Where am I?

12
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,933
These are your new chambers.

13
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:08,771
A little cramped, perhaps,
but you don't need much room, do you?

14
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,984
You are no longer Hand of the King.

15
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,703
For your trouble.

16
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:51,105
I, Joffrey of the House Baratheon,
first of my name,

17
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,984
the rightful King of the Andals
and the First Men,

18
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,322
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm,

19
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,699
do hereby proclaim my grandfather,

20
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:06,746
Tywin Lannister, the savior of the city
and the Hand of the King.

21
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,510
Thank you, Your Grace.

22
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,482
Lord Petyr Baelish, step forward.

23
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:39,111
For your good service and ingenuity

24
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,822
in uniting the Houses of Lannister and Tyrell,

25
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:45,159
I declare that you shall be granted
the castle of Harrenhal

26
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,286
with all its attendant lands and incomes

27
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:52,333
to be held by your sons and grandsons
from this day until the end of time.

28
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,169
You honor me beyond words, Your Grace.

29
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:00,132
I shall have to acquire
some sons and grandsons.

30
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,305
Ser Loras Tyrell.

31
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,146
Your house has come to our aid.

32
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,525
The whole realm is in your debt,
none more so than I.

33
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:20,695
If your family would ask anything of me,
ask it,

34
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,030
and it shall be yours.

35
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,573
Your Grace,

36
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,995
my sister Margaery,
her husband was taken from us before...

37
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,623
She remains innocent.

38
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,419
I would ask you to find it in your heart
to do us the great honor

39
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,879
of joining our houses.

40
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,758
Is this what you want, Lady Margaery?

41
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,972
With all my heart, Your Grace.

42
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,392
I have come to love you from afar.

43
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,022
Tales of your courage and wisdom
have never been far from my ears.

44
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,901
And those tales have taken root
deep inside of me.

45
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:08,576
I, too, have heard tales
of your beauty and grace,

46
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,080
but the tales do not do you justice, my lady.

47
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,376
It would be an honor to return your love,

48
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,254
but I am promised to another.

49
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,716
A king must keep his word.

50
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,176
Your Grace,

51
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:29,889
in the judgment of your Small Council,
it would be neither proper nor wise

52
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:33,559
for you to wed the daughter
of a man beheaded for treason,

53
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:38,147
a girl whose brother is in open rebellion
against the throne as we speak.

54
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:42,568
For the good of the realm,
your councilors beg you

55
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,157
to set Sansa Stark aside.

56
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,328
- Margaery!
- We want Margaery!

57
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,753
I would like to heed your wishes
and the wishes of my people,

58
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,380
but I took a holy vow.

59
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,382
Your Grace,

60
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:09,178
the gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn,

61
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:13,808
but your father, blessed be his memory,

62
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:20,022
made this pact before the Starks
revealed their falseness.

63
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,943
I have consulted with the High Septon

64
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,030
and he assures me
that their crimes against the realm

65
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,909
free you from any promise
you have made to them

66
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,454
in the sight of the gods.

67
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,999
The gods are good.

68
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,335
I am free to heed my heart.

69
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,214
Ser Loras, I will gladly wed your sweet sister.

70
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,716
You will be my queen

71
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:53,389
and I will love you from this day
until my last day.

72
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,496
My lady.

73
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,125
My sincerest condolences.

74
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,170
They're right. I'm not good enough for him.

75
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,088
You shouldn't say that.

76
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,757
You'll be good enough for many things.

77
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,593
He'll still enjoy beating you.

78
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,429
And now that you're a woman,

79
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,183
he'll be able to enjoy you
in other ways as well.

80
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,727
But, if he's not marrying me...

81
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:41,770
He'll let you go home?

82
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:47,026
Joffrey's not the sort of boy
who gives away his toys.

83
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:52,198
You have a tender heart,
just like your mother did at your age.

84
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,783
I can see so much of her in you.

85
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,454
She was like a sister to me.

86
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,001
For her sake, I'll help get you home.

87
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,090
King's Landing is my home now.

88
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,677
Look around you.

89
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,263
We're all liars here.

90
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,351
And every one of us is better than you.

91
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,155
Come in.

92
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,200
Make yourself comfortable.

93
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,501
That doesn't look very comfortable.

94
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,754
Here, watch me.

95
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,678
- No need for that, my dear.
- You sure?

96
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,264
Most men like what they see.

97
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,140
I'm not like most men.

98
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,434
That's what most men say.

99
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:06,146
If you don't want what most men want,

100
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:09,608
then you'd better tell me
what you'd like me to do.

101
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,485
I would like you

102
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:15,906
to tell me if working for Lord Baelish
has been all you'd hoped it would be.

103
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:19,326
Have we met?

104
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,829
You wouldn't remember me if we had?

105
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,372
I meet a lot of men.

106
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,666
And I think you remember all of them.

107
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:29,378
I think your true talents are wasted on them.

108
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,880
You're very kind, my lord.

109
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,383
Allow me to return the favor.

110
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,225
You're afraid.

111
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,312
Why? Nothing dangerous down there.

112
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,897
I know who you are.

113
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:54,403
And, unlike your current employer,
I protect those who work for me.

114
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:59,783
I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims
or force them to abuse each other.

115
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,286
How do you know about that?

116
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,539
I thought you said you knew who I was.

117
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,585
What can I do for you, Lord Varys?

118
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:26,769
Littlefinger looks at you
and sees a collection of profitable holes.

119
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,980
I see a potential partner.

120
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,610
- I'm afraid of him.
- Oh, you should be.

121
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,905
He's a dangerous man.

122
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,533
But everyone has their weaknesses.

123
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:44,870
Your current employer hides his very well,

124
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,415
but not as well as he thinks.

125
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,963
You're a virgin, I take it?

126
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,382
Walk.

127
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:01,220
Childhood must have been awful for you.

128
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:04,139
Were you a foot taller than all the boys?

129
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:07,142
They laughed at you, called you names?

130
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,395
Some boys like a challenge.

131
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:12,898
One or two must have tried
to get inside Big Brienne.

132
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,650
One or two tried.

133
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,734
Ah.

134
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,237
But you fought them off.

135
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,239
But maybe you wished one of them could

136
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:23,700
overpower you, fling you down,
tear off your clothes.

137
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,245
But none of them were strong enough.

138
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,705
- I'm strong enough.
- Not interested.

139
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,668
Of course you are. You'd love to know
what it feels like to be a woman.

140
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,131
Ah.

141
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,174
"They lay with lions."

142
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,176
Tavern girls, I'd say.

143
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,679
Probably served my father's soldiers.

144
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:47,182
Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel.

145
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,726
That's how they earned this.

146
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:53,689
The glorious work of
the Northern freedom fighters.

147
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,941
Must make you proud to serve the Starks.

148
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,026
I don't serve the Starks.

149
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,237
I serve Lady Catelyn.

150
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,699
Tell yourself that tonight
when they swing in your dreams.

151
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,705
- What are you doing?
- Burying them.

152
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:13,125
We shouldn't stay here.
We should get back on the river.

153
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,294
I think these women would understand if...

154
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,795
I don't care what you think.

155
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,298
I didn't leave it here. I had me dagger.

156
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,549
Untie me. Now!

157
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,469
I gave it to you to cut the rope,
and now I don't have me dagger no more.

158
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:26,096
So unless it got stuck in your arse
on its way to your cunt,

159
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:29,016
it stands to reason that it's gone. Whoa.

160
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,102
What's your business here?

161
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,062
Traveling a prisoner.

162
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,651
- You're a woman.
- A woman!

163
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,278
Well, fuck me!

164
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,781
If you've quite finished up...

165
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,162
- All right, we'll be going.
- Whoa. Whoa!

166
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,081
Who do you fight for?

167
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,709
The Starks.

168
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,921
What did he do?

169
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:04,510
- Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?
- No, stealing is a crime.

170
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,179
But it's not a crime to starve.
That's justice for you.

171
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,972
- Where are you taking him?
- To Riverrun.

172
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,849
Why Riverrun?

173
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:13,685
Steal from the Tullys,
it's their dungeons you rot in.

174
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,979
- Why not kill him?
- For stealing a pig?

175
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,315
I don't give the orders.

176
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,775
He must be important to someone.

177
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,694
Sending him with you?
How important could he be?

178
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,323
All right, have it your way,

179
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,617
my lady.

180
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:34,456
- Do I know you?
- Have you been to Ashemark?

181
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,209
- No.
- Then you don't know me.

182
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:40,295
Do you ever go to the river market
at Salt Rock?

183
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,673
- Is it near Ashemark?
- No.

184
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,341
I've never been there.

185
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,885
What do you think of these beauties?

186
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,514
I hope you gave them quick deaths.

187
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,392
Two of them we did, yeah.

188
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:56,770
Wait.

189
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,692
I do know you.

190
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,486
That's Jaime Lannister.

191
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,281
I wish someone had told me.
I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.

192
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,783
If this is the Kingslayer,
I think I'd know about it.

193
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,451
How do you know what
the Kingslayer looks like?

194
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,246
I was at Whispering Wood. I saw him.

195
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,748
They dragged him out of the woods
and threw him down before the king.

196
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,376
He's not the Kingslayer.
Sorry to disappoint you.

197
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,336
If he was, I'd only be traveling his head.

198
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,755
I have a question for you both.

199
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,174
And I want you to answer it at the same time.

200
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,468
I count to three, you both answer.

201
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,679
What's his name?

202
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,514
One.

203
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,767
Two. Three.

204
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,868
Two quick deaths.

205
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:22,898
Those were Stark men.

206
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,400
I don't serve the Starks.

207
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,153
I serve Lady Catelyn.

208
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:32,282
I told you I'd take you to King's Landing,
and that's what I'm going to do.

209
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:35,952
Stay.

210
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:57,015
Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.

211
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,809
I know that.

212
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,311
And you mean to do it anyway?

213
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,274
I love her.

214
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,361
I know that seems important to you.

215
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,071
It is important to me.

216
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:16,284
Your father didn't love me when we married.

217
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,121
He hardly knew me or I him.

218
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,834
Love didn't just happen to us.

219
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,629
We built it slowly over the years,

220
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,423
stone by stone,

221
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,260
for you, for your brothers and sisters,
for all of us.

222
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,598
It's not as exciting as
secret passion in the woods,

223
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,017
but it is stronger.

224
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,812
It lasts longer.

225
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,942
And that is what would be in store for me
with one of Walder Frey's daughters,

226
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,486
- what you and father had?
- Why not?

227
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,530
Because she's not beautiful?

228
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,490
Because she's not exotic and exciting?

229
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:58,493
Now you're arguing just to argue
because you arranged it.

230
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,412
And you agreed to it.

231
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,832
You gave him your word.

232
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,086
Treat your oaths recklessly,
and your people will do the same.

233
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,880
If your father lived his life for one thing...

234
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,631
My father is dead.

235
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:16,720
And the only parent I have left
has no right to call anyone reckless.

236
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,618
You said you saw my victory in the flames.

237
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:40,869
I did.

238
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,039
- I still see it.
- The flames lied.

239
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,417
And I'm no better than a savage

240
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,544
trusting in a fire god.

241
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,258
I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay.

242
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,720
I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell

243
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,765
as their brothers burned alive, and for what?

244
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,894
Attacked from behind
by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells.

245
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,896
If you see so much in your flames,
why didn't you warn me?

246
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,815
The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.

247
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,234
You claimed to speak for a god.

248
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,486
Will you quit the war
just because you've lost a battle?

249
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,905
You talk about war as if you understand it.

250
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,990
I've been fighting far longer than you.

251
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,242
Have you?

252
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,577
Show me how you fight.

253
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,290
Show me.

254
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,590
Where's your god now?

255
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,052
Will he save you?

256
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,264
Where is your god?

257
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:46,017
Inside you.

258
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,280
I murdered my brother.

259
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,290
We murdered him.

260
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,917
Share the weight with me.

261
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:12,919
He wasn't your brother.

262
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,135
This war has just begun.

263
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,345
It will last for years.

264
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,640
Thousands will die at your command.

265
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,811
You will betray the men serving you.

266
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,148
You will betray your family.

267
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,985
You will betray everything
you once held dear.

268
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,114
And it will all be worth it

269
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,910
because you are the Son of Fire.

270
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,412
You are the Warrior of Light.

271
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,168
You will sweep aside
this pretender and that one.

272
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,671
You will be king.

273
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:02,969
You promise these things,

274
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,473
but you don't know.

275
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:08,892
None of us know.

276
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,478
Let me show you.

277
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:23,031
Look into the fire, my king.

278
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,616
Look.

279
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,662
- I see fire.
- Keep looking.

280
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,630
Do you see?

281
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:42,258
Do you see, my king?

282
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,278
Yes.

283
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,291
I will kill that man.

284
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,170
I don't care how many arrows
they feather me with,

285
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,506
how many spears they run through me,

286
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,676
I will kill that horn-blowing cunt before I fall.

287
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:28,013
They want you to know you're surrounded.

288
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,597
I know I'm surrounded.

289
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:32,308
I know that because
I stood on the battlements

290
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,394
and saw I was surrounded.

291
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:35,979
They don't want you to sleep.

292
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,939
They want to sap your spirit before...

293
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:40,150
Thank you, wise bald man.

294
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,904
Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me.

295
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,702
No word from my father?

296
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:53,496
No.

297
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,499
Send more ravens.

298
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,128
You killed all the ravens.

299
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:06,092
The first time I saw Winterfell...

300
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,017
First time I saw Winterfell,

301
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,606
it looked like something
that had been here for thousands of years

302
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:23,526
and would be here for thousands of years
after I was dead.

303
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,655
I saw it and I thought,

304
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:32,660
"Of course, Ned Stark crushed our rebellion
and killed my brothers.

305
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,456
"We never stood a chance against
the man who lives here."

306
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,250
Lord Stark went out of his way
to make it your home.

307
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:44,005
Yes, my captors were so very kind to me.
You love reminding me of that.

308
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:50,386
Everyone in this frozen pile of shit
has always loved reminding me of that.

309
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:58,061
You know what it's like to be told
how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner?

310
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:02,023
To be told how much you owe them?

311
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,904
And then to go back home
to your real father...

312
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,368
I will kill that man.

313
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,911
I swear to the Drowned God,

314
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,496
the Old Gods, the New Gods,

315
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,708
to every fucking god
in every fucking heaven, I will kill that man.

316
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,544
Theon, listen to me.

317
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,547
I serve Winterfell.

318
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,341
Now Winterfell is yours.

319
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:31,219
I'm bound by oath to serve you.

320
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:33,972
And what's your counsel, trusted friend?

321
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:35,598
Run.

322
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:40,728
Five hundred Northmen
wait outside the walls. You have 20 men.

323
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:42,981
You can't win.

324
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,732
Wait for nightfall and run.

325
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,068
There's nowhere to run.

326
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,487
I'd never make it back to the lron islands.

327
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:54,868
And even if I did, even if by some miracle
I slipped through the lines and made it home,

328
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:56,995
I'd be a coward.

329
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,497
The Greyjoy who ran.

330
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,710
The shame of the family.

331
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,338
Don't go home.

332
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:10,758
Join the Night's Watch.

333
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,597
Once a man has taken the black,

334
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,726
he's beyond reach of the law.

335
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:23,271
All his past crimes are forgiven.

336
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,775
I won't make it to the Wall.

337
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,029
I won't make it 10 feet past
the Winterfell gates.

338
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,655
There are ways.

339
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,493
Hidden passageways built
so the Lords of Winterfell could escape.

340
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,955
The road will be dangerous.

341
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:45,418
But with a little luck...

342
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:52,467
The Night's Watch
is an ancient, honorable order.

343
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,846
You'll have opportunities there.

344
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:01,976
The opportunity for Jon Snow
to cut my throat in my sleep.

345
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:06,147
The opportunity to make amends
for what you've done.

346
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:10,860
I've done a lot, haven't I?

347
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,906
Things I never imagined myself doing.

348
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,578
I've known you many years, Theon Greyjoy.

349
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:26,376
You're not the man you're pretending to be.

350
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:30,296
Not yet.

351
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:36,094
You may be right.

352
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:42,642
But I've gone too far
to pretend to be anything else.

353
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,319
You hear that?

354
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,490
That's the mating call of the Northmen.

355
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,450
They want to fuck us.

356
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:04,414
Well, I haven't had a good fuck in weeks.
I'm ready for one.

357
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,419
They say every ironborn man
is worth a dozen from the mainland.

358
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:10,545
Aye!

359
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,756
- You think they're right?
- Aye.

360
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,885
We die today, brothers.

361
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:22,140
We die bleeding from 100 wounds

362
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:25,893
with arrows in our necks
and spears in our guts,

363
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,064
but our war cries will echo through eternity.

364
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:33,901
They will sing about the battle of Winterfell

365
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,738
until the lron islands
have slipped beneath the waves.

366
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:40,783
Every man, woman
and child will know who we were

367
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,744
and how long we stood.

368
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:45,496
Aggar and Gelmarr,

369
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:46,998
Wex and Urzen,

370
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,000
Stygg and Black Lorren.

371
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:52,378
Ironborn warriors will cry out our names

372
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:55,882
as they leap onto the shores
of Seagard and Faircastle.

373
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,091
Aye!

374
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,719
- Mothers will name their sons for us.
- Aye!

375
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,722
Girls will think of us
with their lovers inside them.

376
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:03,806
Aye!

377
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:09,312
And whoever kills that fucking horn-blower
will stand in bronze above the shores of Pyke!

378
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:10,521
Aye!

379
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:14,233
- What is dead may never die!
- What is dead may never die!

380
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:20,573
Thought he'd never shut up.

381
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:24,494
It was a good speech. Didn't want to interrupt.

382
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:29,832
What is this?

383
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,501
What are you doing?

384
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,509
Let's go home.

385
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:43,721
Come on.

386
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,482
Why should I believe you?

387
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,401
Why would I lie about it?

388
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:58,486
To create strife between my sister and me.

389
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,322
Where before there was nothing but love.

390
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:05,993
Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you
on your sister's orders.

391
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:10,164
If it weren't for your squire's bravery,
you'd be a dead man.

392
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,168
- Pod.
- Yes, my lord?

393
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:20,174
Would it be excessive of me to ask you
to save my life twice in a week?

394
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:24,137
- No, my lord.
- You're a good lad.

395
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:26,722
Get Bronn, tell him

396
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:30,059
I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks
outside my door at all times.

397
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:33,813
I'm afraid your friend has been relieved
of his command of the City Watch.

398
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:39,652
The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands
of your father or your sister.

399
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,989
It varies from cloak to cloak.

400
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,908
- Then my hill tribesmen.
- Have gone home.

401
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:49,787
Your father paid them quite handsomely.

402
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:56,919
I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other
for some time, my lord.

403
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:01,382
Don't want to swim too close
to a drowning man?

404
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,594
And I thought we were friends.

405
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,928
We are.

406
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,056
Podrick, would you mind?

407
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,952
There are many who know that without you
this city faced certain defeat.

408
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:33,331
The king won't give you any honors,

409
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,583
the histories won't mention you,

410
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:38,753
but we will not forget.

411
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:42,673
Come along now, Podrick.

412
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:48,930
My love.

413
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:51,849
It was good of you to come.

414
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:54,143
Good of me? Of course I come.

415
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:02,026
- I want to see you.
- Believe me, you don't.

416
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:04,278
Have you looked?

417
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,156
I will be the first.

418
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:32,807
Well?

419
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:35,977
You are a mess.

420
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,523
I'm a monster as well as a dwarf.

421
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:43,985
- You should charge me double.
- You think I'm here for money?

422
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,903
That was the arrangement we made.

423
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,614
I pay you and you lie to me.

424
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:49,699
Oh.

425
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,577
I'm a poor little rich man
and nobody loves me,

426
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:55,413
so I make jokes all the time
and pay them to laugh.

427
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,164
Fuck your money.

428
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,251
- Let's leave.
- Leave?

429
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:04,171
Leave King's Landing. They tried to kill you.
They will try again.

430
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:07,675
Going into wars, fighting soldiers,
you're terrible at this.

431
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:12,263
Let's take a boat to Pentos
and never come back.

432
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,433
- You don't belong here.
- What would we do in Pentos?

433
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,643
Eat, drink,

434
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,146
fuck, live.

435
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:26,861
I want to go with you.

436
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,404
So do it.

437
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:32,658
Your father, your sister, all these bad people,
they can't stop you.

438
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,244
Forget about them. Come with me.

439
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:38,998
I can't.

440
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,126
I do belong here.

441
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:46,672
These bad people are what I'm good at.

442
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,799
Outtalking them, outthinking them.

443
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,218
It's what I am.

444
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,722
And I like it.

445
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,310
I like it more than anything I've ever done.

446
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:06,233
Are you going to leave?

447
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,450
You have a shit memory.

448
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,497
I am yours and you are mine.

449
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:34,095
In the sight of the Seven,

450
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:37,556
I hereby seal these two souls,

451
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:42,937
binding them as one for eternity.

452
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,776
Look upon one another

453
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:51,320
and say the words.

454
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:57,118
- Father, smith...
- Father, smith...

455
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,994
- warrior, mother...
- warrior, mother...

456
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:02,039
- maiden, crone, stranger.
- maiden, crone, stranger.

457
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,543
- I am hers and she is mine...
- I am his and he is mine...

458
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:09,213
- from this day until the end of my days.
- from this day until the end of my days.

459
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:37,825
A house of ghosts, Khaleesi. it is known.

460
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,718
Where are the guards?

461
00:34:55,802 --> 00:35:01,348
No guards.
The warlocks kill with sorcery, not steel.

462
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:04,560
Let them try.

463
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,283
Is this a riddle?

464
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:04,245
Khaleesi!

465
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:08,749
Khaleesi!

466
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:16,006
Are you trying to frighten me
with magic tricks?

467
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:20,386
You want me? Here I am.
Are you afraid of a little girl?

468
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,996
How did he find us?

469
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,690
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you.

470
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:17,943
How did you know we'd come this way?

471
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,614
After all the things you have seen,
this is your question?

472
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:24,116
How did you kill those guards?

473
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,076
Was it hard?

474
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,580
No harder than taking a new name,
if you know the way.

475
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,081
Show me how.

476
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:35,502
- I want to be able to do it, too.
- If you would learn, you must come with me.

477
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,004
Where?

478
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,090
Far and away across
the Narrow Sea to Braavos.

479
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,927
My dancing master was from Braavos.

480
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:47,973
To be a dancing master is a special thing,
but to be a faceless man,

481
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:50,017
that is something else entirely.

482
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:53,604
The girl has many names on her lips.

483
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,106
Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin Lannister,

484
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,317
llyn Payne, the Hound.

485
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:01,153
Names to offer up to the Red God.

486
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:05,532
She could offer them all one by one.

487
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,703
I want to.

488
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:14,249
But I can't.

489
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:18,003
I need to find my brother and mother.

490
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:20,965
And my sister.

491
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,760
I need to find her, too.

492
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,721
Then we must part.

493
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:30,099
A man has duties as well.

494
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,643
- Here.
- What is it?

495
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:35,980
A coin of great value.

496
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,400
Could it buy a horse?

497
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,361
It is not meant for the buying of horses.

498
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,321
Then what good is it?

499
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:46,699
If the day comes
when you must find me again,

500
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:50,119
just give that coin to any man from Braavos
and say these words to him,

501
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:52,496
"Valar Morghulis."

502
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:55,040
Valar Morghulis.

503
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:00,838
Please don't go, Jaqen.

504
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:06,051
Jaqen is dead.

505
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,263
Say it again. Valar Morghulis.

506
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,640
Valar Morghulis.

507
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,435
Good.

508
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,569
Farewell, Arya Stark.

509
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,971
Osha, what are you doing?

510
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:17,266
Tell us what medicine
to get from your chambers.

511
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:20,227
- We'll make you better.
- I feel just fine.

512
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,984
They burned it down. They burned everything.

513
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:29,736
Not everything. Not you.

514
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:35,367
But they may come back. You have to go.

515
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,369
Put on your warmest clothes.

516
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,705
Pack as much food as you can carry
and go north.

517
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,665
North's the wrong way.

518
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,709
And Mother and brother are south.

519
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:45,586
We don't know where.

520
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,589
There are too many enemies in the south.

521
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,716
Go to the Wall, to Jon.

522
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,594
He'll look after you
and let your mother know you're safe.

523
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,721
I don't want to leave you.

524
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:59,099
No more than I want to leave you.

525
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,435
I pulled you into the world.

526
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:04,354
Both of you.

527
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,108
I've seen both your faces
almost every day since.

528
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:10,777
And for that, I consider myself very,

529
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,071
very lucky.

530
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,825
Go now with Hodor. Go on.

531
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:19,620
I'll be right here.

532
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:28,545
Osha.

533
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,673
You must protect them.

534
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,134
You're the only one who can.

535
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:40,015
You may have to protect them
against your own kind.

536
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,517
I've got no great love for my own kind.

537
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:48,148
I'll get you milk of the poppy.

538
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:51,985
- Tell me where to find it.
- I don't want milk of the poppy.

539
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,872
Do it quickly.

540
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,823
Moon of my life.

541
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:21,588
This is dark magic, like the magic
that took you from me.

542
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:25,467
Took you from me before I could even...

543
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:31,389
Maybe I am dead and I just don't know it yet.

544
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:34,768
Maybe I am with you in the Night Lands.

545
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:39,564
Or maybe I refused to enter the Night Lands
without you.

546
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:45,946
Maybe I told the Great Stallion to go fuck
himself and came back here to wait for you.

547
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:49,533
That sounds like something you would do.

548
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:04,589
Or maybe it is a dream.
Your dream, my dream...

549
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:06,466
...I do not know.

550
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:11,596
These are questions
for wise men with skinny arms.

551
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:17,018
You are the moon of my life.

552
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:19,896
That is all I know...

553
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:22,983
...and all I need to know.

554
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:27,654
And if this is a dream...

555
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:32,784
...I will kill the man who tries to wake me.

556
00:48:56,684 --> 00:49:00,186
Until the sun rises in the west
and sets in the east,

557
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:04,858
until the rivers run dry

558
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:08,695
and the mountains blow
in the wind like leaves.

559
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,322
They miss their mother.

560
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:55,200
They want to be with you.

561
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:57,118
Do you want to be with them?

562
00:49:57,203 --> 00:49:58,578
You will be.

563
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:03,667
When your dragons were born,
our magic was born again.

564
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:05,669
It is strongest in their presence.

565
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:08,922
And they are strongest in yours.

566
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:12,092
You will be with them,

567
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:15,011
through winter, summer,

568
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,597
winter again.

569
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,850
Across a thousand, thousand seasons

570
00:50:21,102 --> 00:50:22,686
you will be with them.

571
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:25,897
And we will be with you
until time comes to an end.

572
00:50:31,904 --> 00:50:34,781
Welcome home, Daenerys Stormborn.

573
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:37,283
This is not my home.

574
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:40,787
My home is across the sea,
where my people are waiting for me.

575
00:50:41,122 --> 00:50:42,997
They will be waiting a long time.

576
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:02,267
Dracarys.

577
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:53,109
We should be there by sundown.

578
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:57,697
Won't be a fun night for you.
Mance knows how to make crows sing.

579
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:03,745
If you know what to say,
you might just make it through the night.

580
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,042
Not talking's not the way to go.

581
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:12,420
Careful with that.

582
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:14,380
You might cut yourself.

583
00:52:15,508 --> 00:52:17,425
Never swung a sword before, have you?

584
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,052
You look like a baby with a rattle.

585
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,345
Enough of that!

586
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,857
- Stop!
- Why, traitor?

587
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:36,402
So you can give Mance Rayder
an invitation to Castle Black?

588
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:37,654
Let 'em fight.

589
00:52:58,259 --> 00:53:00,885
That's it? That's what you can do?

590
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,929
You little shit.

591
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:10,061
Your traitor father teach you that?

592
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:15,775
Or was it your whore mother?

593
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:37,505
We are the watchers on the Wall.

594
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,437
You can tell Mance

595
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:56,149
that's the man who killed Qhorin Half hand.

596
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:12,540
- Burn the body.
- Aye.

597
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:15,668
You don't want this one coming back for you.

598
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:30,808
Come along, Jon Snow.

599
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:59,629
Time to meet the King-beyond-the-Wall.

600
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,719
What the...

601
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:55,977
Khaleesi, please.

602
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:58,146
He said you'd never leave Qarth alive.

603
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,272
Come.

604
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,305
Nothing.

605
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:43,149
Thank you, Xaro Xhoan Daxos.

606
00:56:44,026 --> 00:56:46,360
Thank you for teaching me this lesson.

607
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:52,825
I am king of Qarth.
I can help you now, truly help you.

608
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:54,786
We can take the lron Throne.

609
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:57,246
- I'll bring you a thousand ships.
- Please, Khaleesi, I beg you.

610
00:56:57,331 --> 00:56:59,248
All that you have dreamed
is within your reach!

611
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:01,000
I beg you, please!

612
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,962
- Khaleesi.
- Please! Please!

613
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:06,881
Khaleesi!

614
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:28,653
It's all a lie.

615
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:32,031
Looks real enough to me.

616
00:57:36,662 --> 00:57:38,704
Real enough to buy a ship?

617
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:42,708
Aye, a small ship.

618
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:53,136
Take all the gold and jewels.

619
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:30,256
I thought we were coming north
to fight wildlings.

620
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:34,719
Is this goat?

621
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:36,846
It's moose.

622
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:41,017
People shouldn't live anywhere
you need to burn shit to keep warm.

623
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:44,228
Well, you see a tree, let me know.

624
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:49,567
If you step back and think about it,

625
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:51,861
the thing about Gilly that's so interesting is...

626
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:54,030
- Just bloody kill me.
- No, truly.

627
00:58:54,615 --> 00:59:00,077
The thing about her that I find so interesting
is that after all that Craster's done to her,

628
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:02,622
she's still got hope that life might get better.

629
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:05,875
The thing about Gilly
that you find so interesting

630
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,377
is that she said six words to you.

631
00:59:09,213 --> 00:59:12,256
And the thing about you
that I find so interesting

632
00:59:12,341 --> 00:59:14,217
is absolutely nothing.

633
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:20,473
It's Jon and the Half hand. They're back.

634
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:26,896
Two blasts is wildlings.

635
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,815
You're not fighting them alone. Come on.

636
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:35,488
Three blasts?

637
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,031
Run!

638
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:45,998
Wait! Wait for me!

639
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:50,962
Grenn!

640
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:53,631
Edd!

1
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,969
Fall back!

2
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,808
Brother?

3
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,007
Did you send the ravens?

4
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,683
Tarly, look at me.

5
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,246
Did you send the ravens?

6
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,643
That was your job.

7
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,404
Your only job.

8
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,084
We need to get back to the Wall.

9
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,366
It's a long march.

10
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,522
We know what's out there,

11
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,409
but we have to make it, have to warn them

12
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,288
or before winter's done,

13
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,760
everyone you've ever known will be dead.

14
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,924
First time you've seen a giant, Jon Snow?

15
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,280
Well, don't stare too long. They're shy.

16
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,888
When they stop being shy, they get angry.

17
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,201
And when they're angry,

18
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,130
I've seen them pound a man
straight into the ground

19
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,242
like a hammer on a nail.

20
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,686
Crow!
Crow!

21
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,171
Look over there!

22
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,645
Crow!

23
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,326
Crow! Look over here! Look!

24
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,571
Look, crow coming!

25
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,171
Crow!

26
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,760
You're wearing the wrong color.

27
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,160
<i>Manse was a ranger.</i>

28
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,845
In your hearts, all you crows want to fly free.

29
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,368
When I'm free, will I be free to go?

30
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,441
- Crow!
- Crow!

31
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,681
Sure, you will.

32
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,681
And I'll be free to kill you.

33
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,362
Got no respect, this lot.

34
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,002
Got no fathers to slap them when they're foul.

35
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,208
What happened to their fathers?

36
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,206
Some of them were killed by crows like you.

37
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,850
Don't look so grim, Jon Snow.

38
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,924
If Mance Rayder likes you,
you'll live another day.

39
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,370
And if he don't...

40
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,124
I smell a crow.

41
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,921
We killed his friends.
Thought you'd want to question this one.

42
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,208
What do we want with a baby crow?

43
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,170
This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand.

44
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,962
He wants to be one of us.

45
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,050
That half-handed cunt killed friends of mine.

46
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,441
Friends twice your size.

47
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,369
My father told me
big men fall just as quick as little ones

48
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,607
if you put a sword through their hearts.

49
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,651
Plenty of little men
tried to put their swords through my heart.

50
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,563
And there's plenty of little skeletons

51
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,163
buried in the woods.

52
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,121
What's your name, boy?

53
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,406
Jon Snow.

54
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,690
Your Grace.

55
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,649
Your Grace?

56
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,045
Did you hear that?

57
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,805
From now on, you'd better
kneel every time I fart.

58
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,090
Stand, boy.

59
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,324
We don't kneel for anyone beyond the Wall.

60
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,251
So, you're Ned Stark's bastard.

61
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,642
Thank you for the gift,
Lord of Bones. You can leave us.

62
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,324
The girl likes you.

63
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,921
You like her back, Snow?

64
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,082
That why you want to join us?

65
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,924
Don't panic, boy.

66
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,241
This isn't the damned Night's Watch

67
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,687
where we make you swear off girls.

68
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,004
This chicken eater you thought was
king is Tormund Giantsbane.

69
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,331
Can't believe this pup killed the Halfhand.

70
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,280
He was our enemy

71
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,811
and I'm glad he's dead.

72
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,649
He was my brother once.

73
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,525
Back when he had a whole hand.

74
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,047
What were you doing with him?

75
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,930
The Lord Commander
sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.

76
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,490
Why?

77
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,724
He wants me to lead one day.

78
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,043
But here you are, a traitor,

79
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,771
kneeling before the King-beyond-the-Wall.

80
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,049
If I'm a traitor, then you are, too.

81
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,723
Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow?

82
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,842
I want to be free.

83
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,969
No, I don't think so.

84
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,290
I think what you
want most of all is to be a hero.

85
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,528
I'll ask you one last time,

86
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,251
why do you want to join us?

87
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,487
We stopped at Craster's Keep
on the way north.

88
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,445
I saw...

89
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,245
You saw what?

90
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,246
I saw Craster take his own baby
boy and leave it in the woods.

91
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,248
I saw what took it.

92
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,205
You're telling me you saw one of them?

93
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,486
And why would that make you
desert your brothers?

94
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,726
Because when I told the Lord Commander,

95
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,689
he already knew.

96
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:04,049
Thousands of years ago,
the First Men defeated the White Walkers.

97
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,764
I want to fight for the side
that fights for the living.

98
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,801
Did I come to the right place?

99
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,411
We'll need to find you a new cloak.

100
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,206
What if you took off that bit there?

101
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,483
Don't you
want to leave something to the imagination?

102
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,326
Trouble is, I've never had much imagination.

103
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,327
I want you to take it off.

104
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,450
Mouth.

105
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,569
Ser Bronn. Ser Bronn.

106
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,250
I didn't hear that.

107
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,408
- Apologies, ser.
Back away.

108
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,245
Keep backing away
till you're outside this establishment.

109
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,049
Then back away some more.

110
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,929
Lord Tyrion sent me.

111
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,082
I will murder you, boy.

112
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,804
He said it was a matter of life and death.

113
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,850
Pod?

114
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,405
It's your sister.

115
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,723
The queen.

116
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,365
What are they doing here?

117
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,250
Protecting me, I assume. Will you let me in?

118
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,411
No, I don't think so.

119
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,451
If I wanted to kill you,
do you think I'd let a wooden door stop me?

120
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,200
They stay outside.

121
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,282
I'm not afraid of you, little brother.

122
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,290
Why are you here?

123
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,004
I wanted to see your face.

124
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,162
They said you'd lost your nose,

125
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,328
but it's not as gruesome as all that.

126
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,881
The man who cut me lost more than his nose.

127
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,207
I should hope so.

128
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,568
The rebels came
for Joffrey's head, they lost their own.

129
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,971
Thanks to Father.

130
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,844
Thanks to Father.

131
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,921
Of course, it wasn't a rebel
who tried to kill me.

132
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,480
No? Curious.

133
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,281
Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand.

134
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,761
But then I don't suppose
you need much room.

135
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,446
Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke.

136
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,967
You must be proud to be as funny as a
man whose balls brush his knees.

137
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,724
You're meeting Father today?

138
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,920
How do you know that?

139
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,526
Because I have
hundreds of spies in my employ.

140
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,641
The Master of Whisperers
owes me a favor or two.

141
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,850
Father told me. What do you want from him?

142
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,769
What do I want from him? He's my father.

143
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,167
Do I need to want something?

144
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,361
I'm sure he loves me dearly,
as any father loves his child, his baby boy.

145
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,089
Yet he hasn't come to visit once...

146
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,964
- Hmm.
- ...since arriving in King's Landing.

147
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,010
I lay here, my face split in half,

148
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,450
but Father never came.

149
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,127
You're going to make me cry.

150
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,641
Why do you care what I want from him?

151
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,201
Because
you've slandered me to Father before.

152
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,442
Slandered? When?

153
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,366
You told him I had my guards
beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.

154
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,683
You did have your
guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe.

155
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,569
I was nine, too.

156
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,483
She lost an eye, if I remember correctly.

157
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,289
If I remember correctly,

158
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,129
she never stole a necklace again.

159
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,845
It's not slander if it's true.

160
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,685
And what's this truth
you plan on telling him today?

161
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,526
Why are you so nervous
about what I'm going to say to Father?

162
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,807
Because you're a liar.

163
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,043
I expect you'll
tell lies about me, about Joffrey.

164
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,566
Any lies in particular?

165
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,810
You're a clever man,

166
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,882
but not as clever as you think you are.

167
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,804
Mmm. Still makes me more clever than you.

168
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,641
Ah.

169
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,722
Look at these two shining warriors.

170
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:15,449
Ser Taryn Mant and Ser Whosit of Whocares.

171
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,331
Ser Meryn Trant.

172
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,882
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

173
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,724
- You're no knight.
- Pod.

174
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,048
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater
was anointed by the king himself.

175
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,205
You're an up-jumped cutthroat, nothing more.

176
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,328
That's exactly who I am.

177
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,289
And you're a grub in fancy armor

178
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,603
who's better at
beating little girls than fighting men.

179
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,365
Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion.

180
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,091
You put your hand on that door,

181
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,491
you lose the hand.

182
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,251
As much as I appreciate
a walk in the sunshine,

183
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,288
I am wondering why you sent for me.

184
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,921
Many people in this
city want to kill me. You're here to protect me.

185
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,249
I've been doing that for a while now.

186
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,600
Do you grow bored protecting me?

187
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,006
I grow poor protecting you.

188
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,601
Poor? Poor?

189
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,444
Under my patronage you've become a knight,

190
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,488
you've served as Commander
of the City Watch.

191
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,846
Briefly.

192
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,331
I'm sure you filled your pockets.

193
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,448
And now my pockets are empty.

194
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,761
You've given me a taste for the finer things.

195
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,322
And if you want me
protecting you, you'll need to pay more.

196
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,481
I thought we were friends.

197
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,681
We are.

198
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,002
But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword.

199
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,282
I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.

200
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,771
- How much?
- Double.

201
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,841
Double?

202
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,961
I'm a knight now.

203
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,451
Knights are worth double.

204
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,927
I don't even know
how much I'm paying you now.

205
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,048
Which means you can afford it.

206
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,486
Here. Here!

207
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,124
Help me!

208
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,166
Who are you?

209
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,930
I was in the battle at Blackwater.

210
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,967
I was a captain and a knight.

211
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,964
Aye, ser, and serving which king?

212
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,130
The one true king of Westeros,

213
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,162
Stannis Baratheon.

214
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,289
I thought you were dead.

215
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,840
Everyone thought you were dead.

216
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,327
And your son?

217
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,729
He may have swam ashore as you did.

218
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,844
No, the wildfire took him. I saw it.

219
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,284
I'm so sorry, my friend.

220
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,924
I, too, have lost a son.
There is nothing worse in this world.

221
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,402
<i>But, Dawes, you were a good father.</i>

222
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,364
If I was a good father, he'd still be here.

223
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,610
Stannis lives?

224
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,045
He licks his wounds at Dragonstone.

225
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,611
Will you take me there?

226
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,841
There is nothing for me at Dragonstone.

227
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,445
This war is not over.

228
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,684
Not for you, maybe.
But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over.

229
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,603
We're both sworn to King Stannis.

230
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,967
I am sworn to no man.

231
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,880
I promised you 30 ships
and you promised me riches and glory.

232
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,411
I delivered the ships.

233
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,642
Stannis never gives up. Never.

234
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,881
Now he will regroup...

235
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,161
He's a broken man.

236
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,686
His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.

237
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,088
They say he sees no one,
not his generals, not even his wife.

238
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:13,601
Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear,
telling him what she sees in the flames

239
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,525
and burning men alive.

240
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,806
What?

241
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,566
They built a great fire when Stannis returned.

242
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,931
All those who spoke
against her she called servants of darkness.

243
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,924
They say she sang to them as they burned.

244
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,965
I'm a pirate.

245
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,126
You're a smuggler. Servants of darkness.

246
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,291
I'm thinking Dragonstone
is a good place for us to avoid.

247
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,886
Take me back there, please.

248
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,691
You cannot turn
Stannis against her.

249
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,922
Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out.

250
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,126
You could try.

251
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,400
If you fail, they will burn you.

252
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,205
If you succeed, they'll burn you.

253
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,442
And you've only just come back to life.

254
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,727
Stay alive
a little longer, my friend.

255
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,485
You call me friend.
You drank with me on my wedding day.

256
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,562
And you drank with me on four of mine,

257
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,728
but I don't ask you for favors.

258
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,964
I have to stop her. Please, do this for me.

259
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,721
When you are dead,

260
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,246
I will gather your bones in a little sack

261
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,210
and let your widow
wear them around her neck.

262
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,448
We should set
the siege lines 1,000 yards from Harrenhal.

263
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,251
There won't be a siege.
The Mountain can't defend a ruin.

264
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,682
The Mountain will defend
whatever Tywin Lannister tells him.

265
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,127
The Lannisters
have been running from us since Oxcross.

266
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,891
I'd love a fight. The men would love a fight.

267
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,450
I don't think we're going to get one.

268
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,929
Two hundred Northmen
slaughtered like sheep.

269
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,006
The debt will be repaid, my friend.

270
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,924
For them and for your sons.

271
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,082
Will it?

272
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,848
They rot in the ground
while their killer runs free.

273
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,685
The Kingslayer won't remain free for long.

274
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,286
My best hunters are after him.

275
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,124
A Mallister?

276
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,964
Ser Jeremy.

277
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,647
My father's bannerman.

278
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,602
Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell.

279
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,811
She's your mother.

280
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,571
She freed Jaime Lannister.

281
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,608
The Lannisters robbed them of their sons

282
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,762
and she robbed them of their justice.

283
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,761
Water.

284
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,610
Water.

285
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,160
This needs to be cleaned and closed.

286
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,806
What's your name, friend?

287
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,444
Qyburn.

288
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,851
You're lucky to be alive.

289
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,690
Lucky?

290
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,563
The badge looks good on you.

291
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,121
Almost as good as it looked on me.

292
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,404
Are you enjoying your new position?

293
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,645
Am I enjoying it?

294
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,881
I was very happy as Hand of the King.

295
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,129
Yes. I heard how happy you were.

296
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,646
You brought a whore into my bed.

297
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,051
It wasn't your bed at the time.

298
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,731
I sent you here to advise the king.

299
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,882
I gave you real power and authority.

300
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,167
You chose to spend your days

301
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,483
as you always have,

302
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,083
bedding harlots and drinking with thieves.

303
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,971
Occasionally I drank with the harlots.

304
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,327
What do you want, Tyrion?

305
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,404
Why does everyone assume
I want something?

306
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,290
Can't I simply visit with my beloved father?

307
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,051
My beloved father who

308
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,327
somehow forgot to visit his wounded son

309
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,681
after he fell on the battlefield.

310
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,128
Maester Pycelle assured me
your wounds were not fatal.

311
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,727
I organized the defense of this city

312
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,644
while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal.

313
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,166
I led the foray
when the enemies were at the gate

314
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,246
while your grandson,
the king, quivered in fear behind the walls.

315
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,362
I bled in the mud for our family.

316
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,124
And as my reward,
I was trundled off to some dark little cell.

317
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,963
But what do I want?

318
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,411
A little bloody gratitude would be a start.

319
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,609
Jugglers and singers require applause.

320
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,160
You are a Lannister.

321
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,241
Do you think I demanded a garland of roses

322
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,727
every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield?

323
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,841
Hmm?

324
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,571
Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after

325
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,405
and three of them are in open rebellion.

326
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:13,848
So tell me what you want.

327
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,531
I want what is mine by right.

328
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,841
Jaime is your eldest son,
heir to your lands and titles.

329
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:30,005
But he is a Kingsguard,
forbidden from marriage or inheritance.

330
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,361
The day Jaime put on the white cloak,

331
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,721
he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock.

332
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,089
I am your son and lawful heir.

333
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,484
You want Casterly Rock?

334
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,483
It is mine by right.

335
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,767
We'll find you accommodations
more suited to your name

336
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,091
and as a reward for your accomplishments

337
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,931
during the battle of Blackwater Bay.

338
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,090
And when the time is right, you will be given a
position fit for your talents

339
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:09,006
so that you can
serve your family and protect our legacy.

340
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,851
And if you serve faithfully,
you will be rewarded with a suitable wife.

341
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,367
And I would let myself
be consumed by maggots

342
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,048
before mocking the family
name and making you heir to Casterly Rock.

343
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,326
Why?

344
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,607
You ask that?

345
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,849
You, who killed your mother
to come into the world?

346
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:36,084
You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature

347
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,164
full of envy, lust, and low cunning.

348
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,206
Men's laws give you the right to bear my
name and display my colors

349
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,290
since I cannot prove that you are not mine.

350
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,400
And to teach me humility,
the Gods have condemned me

351
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,927
to watch you waddle about
wearing that proud lion

352
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,761
that was my father's sigil
and his father's before him.

353
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,683
But neither Gods nor men

354
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,650
will ever compel me to
let you turn Casterly Rock

355
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,529
into your whorehouse.

356
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,327
Go, now.

357
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,287
Speak no more of
your rights to Casterly Rock.

358
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,925
Go.

359
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,487
One more thing.

360
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,482
The next whore I catch in your bed I'll hang.

361
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,090
Dorne. It's going to Dorne.

362
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,446
Why Dorne?

363
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,891
It's carrying silk

364
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,442
and it's supposed to bring
back wine in exchange.

365
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,921
But it's not coming back.

366
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,401
The captain's tired of risking his life

367
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,562
so King's Landing lords and ladies

368
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,849
can get drunk
on better wine than they deserve.

369
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,248
He's going to stay in Dorne.

370
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,767
Wait out the winter
where it's beautiful and warm.

371
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,481
I met some people in Dorne
who weren't so beautiful and warm.

372
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,881
Don't ruin the game.

373
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,571
I told you, I don't want to play.

374
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,443
What about that one there?

375
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,967
That one? It's going to Volantis.

376
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,201
Why?

377
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,882
Because when I got
on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one.

378
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,450
That's not how the game works.

379
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,121
You're not supposed to just
blurt out the right answer.

380
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,091
You've got to invent a story about
where the ship is going and why.

381
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,290
Why should I make up a story
when I know the truth?

382
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,807
Because the truth
is always either terrible or boring.

383
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,564
Lovely day for it.

384
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,569
Watching the ships.

385
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,290
Lord Baelish.

386
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:07,165
Might I speak
with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?

387
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,685
I saw your mother not long ago.

388
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,368
She's very eager to see you.

389
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,964
And your sister.

390
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,726
Arya's alive?

391
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,204
You said you'd take me home.

392
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,923
You said King's Landing was your home.

393
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,686
You are the property
of the crown. Stealing you would be treason.

394
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,364
If you were to tell just one person...

395
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,566
I won't tell anyone.

396
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,841
How do I know?

397
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,888
Because I'm a terrible liar.

398
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,242
You said so yourself.

399
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,282
Please, Lord Baelish.
Tell me what to do. Tell me when.

400
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,807
I'm waiting for word on an assignment
that will take me far away from the capital.

401
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,283
When I set sail,
I might be able to take you with me.

402
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,609
But you'll need to
be ready to leave on a moment's notice.

403
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,802
You're her handmaiden?

404
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,850
Yes. And you're his...

405
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,002
I help manage his affairs.

406
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,526
He's an important person.

407
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,971
So is she.

408
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,450
I grew up in the shadow of her father's castle.

409
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,844
The day she was born,
they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset.

410
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,805
We've both done rather well, you and I.

411
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,084
Yes.

412
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,049
Given where we started.

413
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,004
And where is that?

414
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:57,165
It's not easy
for girls like us to dig our way out.

415
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,691
Watch out for her.

416
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,724
I always do.

417
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,162
Watch out for her with him.

418
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,841
They're growing fast.

419
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,240
Not fast enough.

420
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,767
I can't wait that long.

421
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,605
I need an army.

422
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,407
We'll be in Astapor by nightfall.

423
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,610
Some say the Unsullied
are the greatest soldiers in the world.

424
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,407
The greatest slave-soldiers in the world.

425
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,687
The distinction
means a good deal to some people.

426
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,206
Do those people have any better ideas

427
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,766
about how to put you on the Iron Throne?

428
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,801
It's too beautiful a day to argue.

429
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,764
You're right.

430
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,881
Another lovely day on the high seas.

431
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,849
Don't mock them.

432
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,127
They're the first Dothraki on a ship.

433
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,521
They followed me across the poison water.

434
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,410
If they'll do it,
others will. And with a true khalasar...

435
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,565
The Dothraki follow strength
above all, Khaleesi.

436
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,565
You'll have a true
khalasar when you prove yourself strong.

437
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,688
And not before.

438
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,365
Your Grace.

439
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,046
I heard you were dead.

440
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,849
Not yet.

441
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,124
I had hoped to speak
to you alone, Your Grace.

442
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,042
We are alone.

443
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,202
Your Grace, you are the rightful king.

444
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,522
Not only by blood.

445
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,208
You're an honorable man, a just man.

446
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,448
And there is still a war to fight.

447
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,683
I am fighting.

448
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,851
By burning prisoners alive?

449
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,804
How would you punish
the infidels, Ser Davos?

450
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,531
I do not judge people
for the Gods they worship.

451
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,887
If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea

452
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,327
before you ever set foot on Dragonstone.

453
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,606
I'm not your enemy.

454
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,051
You are my enemy.

455
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,288
Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay?

456
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,167
Did I set your ships ablaze?

457
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,808
I wasn't there when the wildfire

458
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,968
killed our men by the thousands.

459
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,763
I could have saved those men.

460
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,122
You would have taken the city, Stannis would
sit upon his rightful throne,

461
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,730
and you would stand beside him.

462
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,489
But I wasn't there

463
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,928
because you convinced
your king to leave me behind.

464
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,170
Do you hear them screaming?

465
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,645
All those burning men
in the water crying for their mothers,

466
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,125
for their Gods for help?

467
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,283
Until the moment
the Blackwater swallowed them.

468
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,571
Don't despair, Ser Davos.

469
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,642
What I told your son is true.

470
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,802
Death by fire is the purest death.

471
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,891
This woman is evil!

472
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,684
She's the mother of demons.

473
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,083
Take him and lock him in a cell.

474
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,571
- Your Grace!
- Come on.

475
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,165
You've chosen the darkness, Ser Davos.

476
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,605
She will destroy us all!

477
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,125
I will pray for you.

478
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,324
Your Grace!

479
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,331
Halt. Down.

480
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,324
Halt. Down.

481
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,885
Why have we stopped?

482
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,246
It's Lady Margaery, Your Grace.

483
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,844
What is she doing?
Who gave her permission?

484
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,523
My lady.
We should have guards, my lady.

485
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,681
<i>MARGAERY: Why?</i>

486
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,731
Pardon me.

487
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,641
Stop, my lady. You'll ruin your dress.

488
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,085
I have others.

489
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,202
Would you like to speak with her, Your Grace?

490
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,486
No.

491
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,368
He was a soldier.

492
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,240
He went to fight on the walls when the
ships came into Blackwater Bay.

493
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,089
He never came back.

494
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,003
And your mother?

495
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,287
She died when she had me.

496
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,606
Bad men wanted to
come into this city and do terrible things,

497
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,763
but your father stopped them.

498
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,441
Whenever you look at this knight,

499
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,887
I want you to remember your father.

500
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,206
He wasn't a knight. He was just a soldier.

501
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,886
And what do knights swear to do?

502
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,203
Protect the weak and uphold the good.

503
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,965
Your father did that. Be proud of him.

504
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,810
Was your father a soldier, too?

505
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,961
You should be proud, too.

506
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,480
Under King Joffrey's
leadership, your fathers saved the city.

507
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,849
They saved us all.

508
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,089
From now on, we're going to take care of you.

509
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,643
All of you.

510
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,520
Come to me for what you need to feed
them, clothe them, or house them.

511
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,164
Directly to me.

512
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,404
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

513
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,164
Please, sit. Sit.

514
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,686
I do apologize, my lady.

515
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,127
Small Council meetings.

516
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,409
At what point does
it become treason to waste the king's time?

517
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,405
That's a lovely gown, my lady.

518
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,608
Yes, it suits you perfectly.

519
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,967
I imagine you might be rather cold.

520
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,690
The climate is a bit more forgiving

521
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,370
back in Highgarden, Your Grace.

522
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,643
Shall I have them
bring you a shawl, my lady?

523
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,121
I am touched by your concern, Your Grace.

524
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,488
Luckily for us Tyrells,
our blood runs quite warm.

525
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,607
Doesn't it, Loras?

526
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,767
Yes.

527
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,127
Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent?

528
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,207
The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork.

529
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,482
I've never seen anything like it.

530
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,801
You might find a bit of armor quite useful

531
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,247
once you become queen. Perhaps before.

532
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,768
Joffrey tells me you
stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom

533
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,922
on your way back from the sept this morning.

534
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,006
Yes. I paid a visit to an orphanage
the High Septon told me about.

535
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,926
Margaery does a great deal of work

536
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,320
with the poor back in Highgarden.

537
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,521
The lowest
among us are no different from the highest

538
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,840
if you give them a chance

539
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,922
and approach them with an open heart.

540
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,889
An open heart is what you'll get

541
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,889
if you're not careful, my dear.

542
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,646
Not long ago,
we were attacked by a mob there.

543
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,485
We had a full complement
of guards that didn't stop them.

544
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,409
The king barely escaped with his life.

545
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:53,371
My mother's always had a penchant for drama.

546
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,650
Facts become less and
less important to her as she grows older.

547
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,610
Our lives were never truly in danger.

548
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,763
You're right, of course.

549
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,049
But you are your father's son.

550
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,646
We can't all have a king's bravery.

551
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,681
Hunger turns men into beasts.

552
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:23,522
I'm glad House Tyrell
has been able to help in this regard.

553
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:27,047
They tell me 100
wagons arrive daily now from the Reach.

554
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,687
Wheat, barley, apples.
We've had a blessed harvest.

555
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:35,527
And it's our duty
to assist the capital in time of need.

556
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,250
Well, as Ser Loras said,

557
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,084
Lady Margaery has done this sort

558
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,243
of, uh, charitable work before.

559
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,006
I'm sure she knows what she's doing.

560
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,002
I'm sure she does.

561
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:22,401
The Unsullied have stood here
for a day and a night with no food or water.

562
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,363
They will stand until they drop.

563
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,723
Such is their obedience.

564
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:40,408
They may suit my needs.
Tell me of their training.

565
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,841
The Westerosi woman is pleased with them,

566
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:48,124
but speaks no praise to keep the price down.

567
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,524
She wishes to know how they are trained.

568
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:58,481
Tell her what
she would know and be quick about it.

569
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,089
The day is hot.

570
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,647
They begin their training at 5.

571
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,609
Every day they drill from dawn to dusk

572
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,603
until they have mastered the shortsword,

573
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,686
the shield, and the three spears.

574
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,003
Only one boy in four
survives this rigorous training.

575
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,041
Their discipline
and loyalty are absolute.

576
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,049
They fear nothing.

577
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,521
Even the bravest men fear death.

578
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:29,447
The knight says even brave men fear death.

579
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,684
Tell the old man he smells of piss.

580
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,281
Truly, Master?

581
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,361
No, not truly.

582
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:41,008
Are you a girl or a goat to ask such a thing?

583
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:50,449
My master says the Unsullied
are not men. Death means nothing to them.

584
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,249
Tell this ignorant whore of a Westerner

585
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,283
to open her eyes and watch.

586
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,409
He begs you attend
to this carefully, Your Grace.

587
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,728
Tell the good master there is no need.

588
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,646
She's worried about their nipples?

589
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,569
Does the dumb bitch know
we've cut off their balls?

590
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,325
My master
points out that men don't need nipples.

591
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:35,807
Here, I'm done with you.

592
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,442
This one is pleased to have served you.

593
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,445
To win his shield,

594
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:52,320
an Unsullied must go
to the slave marts with a silver mark,

595
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,890
find a newborn
and kill it before its mother's eyes.

596
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,762
This way, my master says, we make certain

597
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,962
there is no weakness left in them.

598
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,250
You take a babe from its mother's arms,

599
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,961
kill it as she watches,
and pay for her pain with a silver coin?

600
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,441
She is offended.

601
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,724
She asks
if you pay a silver coin to the mother,

602
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,881
for her dead baby.

603
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:23,042
What a soft mewling fool this one is.

604
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,006
My master would
like you to know that the silver is paid

605
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,560
to the baby's owner, not the mother.

606
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,322
How many do you have to sell?

607
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,360
Eight thousand.

608
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:51,565
Tell the Westerosi whore
she has until tomorrow.

609
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,325
Master Kraznys
asks that you please hurry.

610
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,171
Many other buyers are interested.

611
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,641
Eight thousand dead babies.

612
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,410
The Unsullied are a means to an end.

613
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,403
Once I own them, these men...

614
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,370
They're not men. Not anymore.

615
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,523
Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be?

616
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,206
You think these slaves will have better lives

617
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,971
serving men like Kraznys or serving you?

618
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,124
You'll be fair to them.
You won't mutilate them to make a point.

619
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,281
You won't order them to murder babies.

620
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,801
You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered.

621
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,486
A great injustice has been done to them.

622
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,201
Closing your eyes will not undo it.

623
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,043
The warlocks.

624
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:06,404
I owe you my life, ser.

625
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,326
The honor is mine, my queen.

626
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,001
You know this man?

627
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,003
I know him

628
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,128
as one of the greatest fighters

629
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,328
the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen

630
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,724
and as the Lord Commander
of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard.

631
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,242
King Robert is dead.

632
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:34,689
I have been searching for you, Daenerys
Stormborn, to ask your forgiveness.

633
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,571
I was sworn to protect your family.

634
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,403
I failed them.

635
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:52,403
I am Barristan Selmy,
Kingsguard to your father.

636
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:57,651
Allow me to join your Queensguard
and I will not fail you again.

1
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,365
Don't think too much, Bran.

2
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,085
Relax your bow arm.

3
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,287
And which one of you
was a marksman at 10?

4
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,407
Father?

5
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,761
You can't kill it, you know.

6
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,250
Why not?

7
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,888
Because the raven is you.

8
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,001
Hodor.

9
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,647
It's all right, Hodor.

10
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,525
Hodor.

11
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,891
Were you
inside the wolf again, little lord?

12
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,645
No, it was the three-eyed raven.

13
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,162
He's back.

14
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,283
I tried to kill it, but I couldn't.

15
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,489
- There was a boy.
I don't want to hear about it.

16
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,250
- But you asked.
- We've got plenty of worries.

17
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,891
We don't need to pour
black magic on top of them.

18
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,241
I didn't ask for black magic dreams.

19
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,487
I know you didn't, little lord.

20
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,482
We need to move. We don't know
who might be after us.

21
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,091
No one knows we're alive.

22
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,164
And who told you that?

23
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,602
The three-eyed raven tell you?

24
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,170
- No.
- Some good he is, then.

25
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,846
I don't know what people know and don't.

26
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,688
I only know the Wall is a long way off.

27
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,691
My mother always
told me you Westerosi were a grim lot.

28
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,123
Grim, bearded,

29
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,761
stinking barbarians
that would row across the Narrow Sea

30
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,083
and steal us from our beds.

31
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,686
Did you ever think you'd marry one?

32
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,566
I never thought I'd marry anyone at all.

33
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,449
Never?

34
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,611
Not until I met the king
of the grim, bearded, stinking barbarians.

35
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,923
Pardon me, Your Grace.

36
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,085
My queen.

37
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,531
Lord Bolton.

38
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,564
Let me guess which is the good news.

39
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,642
Word from Riverrun and Winterfell.

40
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,527
I hadn't seen him in years.

41
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,561
I don't even know how many.

42
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,162
We'll travel to the funeral together.

43
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,805
Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return.

44
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,288
Will I be wearing manacles
when I lay my father to rest?

45
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,204
Something else?

46
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,128
Before Bolton's bastard got to
Winterfell, the ironborn were gone.

47
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,969
They massacred everyone
and put the castle to the torch.

48
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,088
And Bran and Rickon have not been found.

49
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,961
They may have escaped.

50
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,723
Or Theon may have taken
them to the Iron Islands as hostages.

51
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,882
Have you received any demands?

52
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,321
No.

53
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,444
Have you heard anything from Theon at all?

54
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,842
Where am I?

55
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,322
Who are you?

56
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,240
What do you want?

57
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,209
I want to do this.

58
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,606
Do you know how
long it'll take to get to King's Landing

59
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,330
walking through fields and forests?

60
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,050
Yes.

61
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,011
How shall we pass the time?

62
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,048
By putting one foot in front of the other.

63
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,043
It's going to be a very dull walk.

64
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,690
I'm here to take you to King's Landing

65
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,366
and bring back
Lady Stark's daughters in exchange.

66
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,410
Dull is fine.

67
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,563
You know, it doesn't matter
how loyal a servant you are,

68
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,371
no one enjoys the company
of a humorless mute.

69
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,845
Trust me on this.

70
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,127
People have been serving me
since I was born.

71
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,363
You think Lady Stark
is going to want a giant towheaded plank

72
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,841
following her around for the rest of her life?

73
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,244
A week's journey with you
and she'll order you to fall on your sword.

74
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,166
If Lady Stark is
unhappy with any aspect of my service,

75
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,528
I'm sure she'll let me know.
She's an honest woman.

76
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,523
For all the good it's done her.

77
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,604
How did you come into Lady Stark's service?

78
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,489
There's something we can talk about.

79
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,164
Not your concern, Kingslayer.

80
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,005
It had to be recently.
You weren't with her at Winterfell.

81
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,566
How would you know?

82
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,646
Because I visited Winterfell.

83
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,361
I would have noticed your dour
head smacking into the archways.

84
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,441
Move.

85
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,602
- Were you pledged to Stannis?
- Gods, no.

86
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,648
Ah, Renly. Really?

87
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,245
He wasn't fit to rule over anything

88
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,850
more important than a 12-course meal.

89
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,610
- Shut your mouth.
- Why?

90
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,964
I lived with him at
court since he was a boy, don't forget.

91
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,202
Could hardly escape the little tulip.

92
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,204
Skipping down the corridors
in his embroidered silks.

93
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,770
I knew him better than you.

94
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,808
I knew him as well as anyone.

95
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,362
As a member of his Kingsguard,
he trusted me with everything.

96
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,726
He would have been a wonderful king.

97
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,040
Sounds like you quite fancied him.

98
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,726
I did not fancy him.

99
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,801
Oh, Gods, you did.

100
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,961
Did you ever tell him? No, of course not.

101
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,851
You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid.

102
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,561
He preferred curly-haired
little girls like Loras Tyrell.

103
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,165
You're far too much man for him.

104
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,890
I'm not interested in foul rumors.

105
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,241
Unless they're about me.

106
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,402
It's all true about Renly.

107
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,404
His proclivities
were the worst kept secret at court.

108
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,289
It's a shame
the throne isn't made out of cocks.

109
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,805
They'd have never got him off it.

110
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,331
Shut your mouth!

111
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,086
I don't blame him.
And I don't blame you, either.

112
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,490
We don't get to choose who we love.

113
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,206
Where are you headed, then?

114
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,481
South.

115
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,642
- You?
- Riverrun.

116
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,930
Staying off the King's Road, are you?

117
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,690
They get you no matter where you go.

118
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,841
You can't win.

119
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,047
No, you really can't.

120
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,849
Looks like you're safe enough.

121
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,766
Meaning no offense, my lady, but
I wouldn't tangle with you.

122
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,723
- Seven blessings to you.
- And you.

123
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,486
He knows who I am.

124
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,806
He doesn't.

125
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,930
Maybe you're right.
What if you're not? What if he tells someone?

126
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,048
We're not doing it.

127
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,369
He's an innocent man.

128
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,920
More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?

129
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,848
Make it tighter here.

130
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,286
Mmm. That's better.

131
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,081
It makes you look very strong.

132
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,241
No flowers.

133
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,728
I said no flowers.

134
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,165
All these are wrong. Bring others.

135
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,083
Yes, Your Grace.

136
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,446
Bloody flowers. On the king.

137
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,286
Looks like a Tyrell rose.
Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown.

138
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,842
Should be more than enough fabric.

139
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,970
Tell me what you think of her.

140
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,087
Who?

141
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,529
Margaery.

142
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,284
She's an ideal match.

143
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,365
With the Tyrells beside us,
we'll crush the Northerners.

144
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,128
Hang their lords, burn their
strongholds, sow their fields with salt,

145
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,727
and no one will think
of rebelling for another century.

146
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,124
It is a good match,
but what do you think of her?

147
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,922
She's beautiful and intelligent.

148
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,001
Yes, she is.

149
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,730
Her concern with the well-being

150
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,524
of the common people is interesting.

151
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,005
Not to me.

152
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,327
I only meant
to go out of your way to endanger...

153
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,167
This is becoming one of the
most boring conversations I've ever had.

154
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,167
Margaery Tyrell dotes
on filthy urchins for a reason.

155
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,650
She dresses like a harlot for a reason.

156
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,449
Married a traitor and known degenerate

157
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,284
like Renly Baratheon for a reason.

158
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,842
She married Renly Baratheon
because she was told to.

159
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,683
That's what
intelligent women do. What they're told.

160
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,050
You need to ask yourself...

161
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,884
I don't need to do anything.

162
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,131
Better.

163
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,885
Much better.

164
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,164
I still don't believe it.

165
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,924
He didn't want anything.

166
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,447
He just takes an interest
because he loved my mother.

167
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,325
Men only want one thing from a pretty girl.

168
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,565
Littlefinger's not in love with me.

169
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,605
Love is not the thing he wants.

170
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,811
He's too old.

171
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,882
They never see it that way.

172
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,002
He didn't ask you to do something for him?

173
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,242
Spy on someone or...

174
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,765
No.

175
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,448
If he does ask you for anything or try anything

176
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,927
or touch you, I want you to tell me.

177
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,207
Why? What will you do?

178
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,964
I will make him stop.

179
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,082
Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady.

180
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,447
Send him in.

181
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,206
Lady Sansa.

182
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,611
Ser Loras.

183
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,445
My sister invites you
to take the air with her and our grandmother,

184
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,807
the Lady Olenna, in the gardens.

185
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,442
May I escort you to them?

186
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,370
I believe you
grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa.

187
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,562
You are too kind, Ser Loras.

188
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,322
You probably don't remember
the first time we met.

189
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,803
At the Hand's tourney,
you gave me your favor.

190
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,884
A rose, a red rose.

191
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,121
Of course I did.

192
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,007
It's more your color. You take it.

193
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,650
Thank you.

194
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,404
You're such a dear.

195
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,881
I'll take my leave.

196
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,450
Lady Sansa.

197
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,602
Thank you, Ser Loras.

198
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,003
Come.

199
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,089
Lady Sansa, it is my honor
to present my grandmother.

200
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,931
The Lady Olenna of House Tyrell.

201
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,923
Kiss me, child.

202
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,050
It's so good of you
to visit me and my foolish flock of hens.

203
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,288
We're very sorry for your losses.

204
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,762
And I was sorry when
I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery.

205
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,009
- He was very gallant.
Yes.

206
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,287
And charming and very clean.

207
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,601
He knew how to dress
and smile and somehow

208
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,047
this gave him the notion he was fit to be king.

209
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,043
Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother.

210
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,049
Father liked him and so did Loras.

211
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,044
Loras is young and good
at knocking men off horses with a stick.

212
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,847
That does not make him wise.

213
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,809
As to your fathead father...

214
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,560
Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?

215
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,611
She might think we have some wits about
us. One of us, at any rate.

216
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,166
It was treason. I warned them.

217
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,411
Robert has two sons
and Renly has an older brother.

218
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,204
How can he possibly have any
claim to that ugly iron chair?

219
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,409
We should have stayed
well out of all this if you ask me.

220
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,448
But once the cow's been milked, there's no

221
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,528
squirting the cream back up her udders.

222
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,046
So here we are to see things through.

223
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,168
What do you say to that, Sansa?

224
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,242
Shall we have some lemon cakes?

225
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,730
Lemon cake's my favorite.

226
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,410
So we've been told.

227
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,970
Are you going to bring the food

228
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,605
or do you mean to starve us to death?

229
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,247
Here, Sansa, come sit with me.

230
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,768
I'm much less boring than these others.

231
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,004
Do you know my son?

232
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,003
The Lord of Highgarden?

233
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,208
I haven't had the pleasure.

234
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,931
Mmm. No great
pleasure, believe me. A ponderous oaf.

235
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,442
His father was an oaf
as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor.

236
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,444
He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking.

237
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,843
They say he was looking up at the sky

238
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,367
and paying no mind
to where his horse was taking him.

239
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,249
And now my son is doing the same,

240
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,881
only this time
he's riding a lion instead of a horse.

241
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,566
Now...

242
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,291
I want you to tell me the truth

243
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,046
about this royal boy, this Joffrey.

244
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,044
I... I...

245
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,329
You, you. Who else would know better?

246
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,885
We've heard some
troubling tales. Is there any truth to them?

247
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,090
Has this boy mistreated you?
Has he ripped out your tongue?

248
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:51,566
King Joffrey,
His Grace is very fair and handsome

249
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,290
and as brave as a lion.

250
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,409
Yes, all Lannisters are lions.

251
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,245
And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose.

252
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,328
But how kind is he? How clever?

253
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,682
Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?

254
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,207
I'm to be his wife.
I only want to know what that means.

255
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,886
Bring me some cheese.

256
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,088
Cheese will be sewed
after the cakes, my lady.

257
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,521
The cheese will be sewed
when I want it sewed.

258
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,931
I want it served now.

259
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,568
Are you frightened, child? No need for that.

260
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,327
We're only women here.
Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you.

261
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,127
My father always told the truth.

262
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,047
Yes, he had that reputation.
And they named him traitor and took his head.

263
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,167
Joffrey.

264
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,124
Joffrey did that.

265
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,884
He promised he would be merciful

266
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,724
and he cut my father's head off.

267
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,404
And he said that was mercy.

268
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,527
Then he took me
up on the walls and made me look at it.

269
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,081
Go on.

270
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,325
I can't. I never meant...

271
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,609
My father was a traitor.

272
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,648
My brother as well. I have traitor's blood.

273
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,808
Please don't make me say any more.

274
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,167
She's terrified, Grandmother. Look at her.

275
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,689
Speak freely, child.

276
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,084
We would never
betray your confidence, I swear it.

277
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,804
He's a monster.

278
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,761
Ah.

279
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,287
That's a pity.

280
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,448
Please, don't stop the wedding.

281
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,285
Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden

282
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,205
is determined that Margaery shall be queen.

283
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,969
Even so, we thank you for the truth.

284
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,081
Ah.

285
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,288
Here comes my cheese.

286
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,686
We're at war.
This march is a distraction.

287
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,923
My grandfather's
funeral is not a distraction.

288
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,240
Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?

289
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,640
No.

290
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,047
Then it's a distraction.

291
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,964
My Uncle Edmure
has his forces garrisoned there.

292
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,849
We need his men.

293
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,962
Unless he's been breeding them,

294
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,162
he don't have enough to make a difference.

295
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,882
Have you lost faith in our cause?

296
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,483
If it's revenge, I still got faith in it.

297
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,080
If you no longer believe...

298
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,208
I can believe till it snows in Dorne.

299
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,841
Don't change the fact
that we've got half the men.

300
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,245
You don't think we can win?

301
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,163
May I speak my mind, Your Grace?

302
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,767
Have you not been
speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?

303
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,682
I think you lost this war
the day you married her.

304
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,804
Whoa! Whoa!

305
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,760
Your Grace.

306
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,211
You're afraid of her.

307
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,366
And she knows it.

308
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,766
I'm not afraid of her.

309
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,963
May I help you, Lady Stark?

310
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,530
No.

311
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,201
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have...

312
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,487
You can't help because a mother

313
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,807
makes one for her children to protect them.

314
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,128
Only a mother can make them.

315
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,721
You've made them before?

316
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,244
Twice.

317
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,487
Did they work?

318
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,083
After a fashion.

319
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,046
I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall.

320
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,685
Many years before that,
one of the boys came down with the pox.

321
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,969
Maester Luwin said
if he made it through the night, he'd live.

322
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,447
But it would be a very long night.

323
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,528
So I sat with him all through the darkness.

324
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,082
Listened to his ragged little breaths.

325
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,925
His coughing, his whimpering.

326
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,730
Which boy?

327
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,889
Jon Snow.

328
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,204
When my husband brought that baby home
from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him.

329
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,328
I didn't want to see those brown

330
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,602
stranger's eyes staring up at me.

331
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,491
So I prayed to the Gods,
take him away. Make him die.

332
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,206
He got the pox.

333
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,810
And I knew I was
the worst woman who ever lived.

334
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,688
A murderer.

335
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,406
I'd condemned this poor,
innocent child to a horrible death

336
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,642
all because I was jealous of his mother.

337
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,286
A woman he didn't even know.

338
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,491
So I prayed to all seven Gods,

339
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,971
let the boy live.

340
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,728
Let him live and I'll love him.

341
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,724
I'll be a mother to him.

342
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,600
I'll beg my husband to give him a true name,

343
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,251
to call him Stark and be done with it,

344
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,011
to make him one of us.

345
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,369
And he lived.

346
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,367
And I couldn't keep my promise.

347
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,884
And everything that's happened since then,

348
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,768
all this horror that's come to my family,

349
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,886
it's all because I couldn't
love a motherless child.

350
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,886
Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand?

351
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,651
Yes.

352
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,848
You liked him?

353
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,488
I like you, but if you're playing us false,

354
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,602
it won't be hard for me to kill you.

355
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,287
I've got wildling
blood in my veins. These are my people.

356
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,566
I understand.

357
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,849
Well, how could you understand?

358
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,888
You want to protect your people.

359
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,961
Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans,

360
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,807
half of whom want to massacre the other
half for one insult or another?

361
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,521
They speak seven
different languages in my army.

362
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,526
The Thenns hate the Hornfoots. The
Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans.

363
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,361
Everyone hates the cave people.

364
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,810
So you know how I got moon
worshippers and cannibals and giants

365
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,247
to march together in the same army?

366
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,367
No.

367
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,562
I told them we
were all going to die if we don't get south.

368
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,290
Because that's the truth.

369
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,287
Shouldn't be long now.

370
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,881
What's wrong with him?

371
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,724
He's a warg.

372
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,651
He can enter
the mind of animals, see through their eyes.

373
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,326
He's scouting for us.

374
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,881
What, you've never met a warg?

375
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,166
Orell.

376
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,406
Where were you this time?

377
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,921
The Fist of the First Men.

378
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,241
What did you see?

379
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,522
Dead crows.

380
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,887
What's the matter, Piggy?
You crying 'cause you're cold?

381
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,491
There's 200 brothers killed by dead men

382
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,967
and you're still here

383
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,646
whimpering.

384
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,802
That seem fair to you?

385
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:17,166
I seen 'em torn to pieces fighting
while you was off somewhere hiding in a hole.

386
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,525
Why don't you lie down
and rest for a while, eh?

387
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,407
You know you want to.

388
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,209
Hey-

389
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,960
Get up, Sam.

390
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,246
No.

391
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,600
Get up.

392
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,285
I can't.

393
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,687
If you stop, you'll die.

394
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,526
'Course if you don't stop,
you'll probably die, too.

395
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,931
You don't care.

396
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,445
'Course we care.

397
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,841
You left me.

398
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,126
When the White Walkers came,
you left me.

399
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,967
Aye, we left you. You're fat and you're slow.

400
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,202
We didn't want to die.

401
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,361
Help me get him up.

402
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,090
Looks like that piggy is done for.

403
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,366
Help us get him up.

404
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,720
He's slowing us down.

405
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,484
Just get him up!

406
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,369
Why? So the rest of us can die?

407
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,241
We'll move faster without him.

408
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,369
What is this? Get up, Tarly.

409
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,646
Is he all right?

410
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,801
Aye, I think so.

411
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,486
- We may as well just go without him.
- That's enough.

412
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,326
Tarly, I forbid you to die.

413
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,282
Do you hear me?

414
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,442
Why should the rest of us...

415
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,642
Rast, you're responsible for him.

416
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,164
What am I supposed to do?

417
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,402
Make sure he gets back alive.

418
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,165
If he doesn't, you don't.

419
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,683
Move on!

420
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,004
I'm not dying for you, Piggy. You hear me?

421
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,044
Where's Rickon and Hodor?

422
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,889
Looking for food.

423
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,003
What's out there?

424
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,809
Not another step, boy.
Unless you want to drown in your own blood.

425
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,166
I'm unarmed.

426
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,570
That was poor planning.

427
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,290
My sister carries the weapons.

428
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,925
I'm better with them.

429
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,523
Drop the spear.

430
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,445
Drop it.

431
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,482
If you kill me, that wolf will tear you to bits.

432
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,603
You must be Summer.

433
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,850
I'm Jojen Reed. This is my sister, Meera.

434
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,771
We've come a long way to find you, Brandon.

435
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,566
And we have much farther to go.

436
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,686
I'm just trying to understand.

437
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,649
Would you please shut up about it?

438
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,649
Jaqen H'ghar offered you three kills.

439
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,926
I'm not listening.

440
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,280
But just explain it to me.

441
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,762
He offered to kill
any three people you wanted. Dead.

442
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,411
All you had to do
was give him the names. Anyone.

443
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,481
You could have picked King Joffrey.

444
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,561
Shut up.

445
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,324
You could have picked Tywin Lannister.

446
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,290
Jaqen got us out
of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining?

447
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,249
But you could have ended the war.

448
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,161
Where are we going?

449
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,281
North.

450
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,011
We should have come
to the Red Fork River by now.

451
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,206
Maybe we passed it.

452
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,967
It's 100 feet wide.
How could we have passed it?

453
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,130
If we hit the Red Fork,
we can follow it west to Riverrun.

454
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,091
My mother grew up there.
My grandfather's a lord. He'll protect us.

455
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,808
- Could be a minstrel.
- Shut up.

456
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,722
A minstrel's got gold sometimes.

457
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,724
We could jump him,
tie him up, steal his gold, and buy some food.

458
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,801
Shh!

459
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,083
And so he spoke, and so he spoke

460
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,687
That lord of Castamere

461
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:15,203
But now the rains weep o'er his hall

462
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,363
With no one there to hear

463
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:26,763
What's
lurking behind that wall? A lion? A wolf?

464
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,086
Just a dirty little cub, I think.

465
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,049
Loose a few more shafts.
- Don't.

466
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,643
Put the sword down, girl.

467
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,525
You go on down the road.
Keep singing so we know where you are.

468
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,487
Leave us be and I won't kill you.

469
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,441
Generous.

470
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,687
You're a dangerous person.

471
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,647
I like dangerous people.

472
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,807
Why are your friends so shy?

473
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,607
What friends?

474
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,805
The fat one to your left
and the lad beside him.

475
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:42,167
Three young ones
on the run carrying castle-forged swords.

476
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,083
You escape from Harrenhal?

477
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,321
Who are you?

478
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,601
Thoros of Myr.

479
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,644
The fellow with the bow is Anguy.

480
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,245
No, who do you fight for?

481
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,970
The Brotherhood Without Banners.

482
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,361
Now come along.

483
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:01,847
I want to hear how two boys
and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal.

484
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,890
I'm not going with them. The Brotherhood?

485
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,406
That's who the Mountain were looking for.

486
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,289
They'll bring us back and put rats in us.

487
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,243
You've got nothing to fear from us.

488
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,051
The lords of Westeros
want to burn the countryside.

489
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,122
We're trying to save it.

490
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,363
Now come on.
We'll talk more over brown bread and stew.

491
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,362
And then you can go on your way.

492
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,804
Here's the thing, fat boy.

493
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,160
When I'm done talking,
that arrow's falling down on your fat head.

494
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,963
So I advise you move,
because I'm done talking.

495
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,768
Half the country's starving
and look at this one.

496
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,049
Maybe he's the reason
half the country's starving.

497
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,922
My lion.

498
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,203
We've spoken of this.

499
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,405
You cannot come here.

500
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,166
But you said I should come
to you with any problems.

501
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,925
Did anyone see you?

502
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,283
- No.
- You sure?

503
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,601
My father does not make idle threats.

504
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,970
Having you killed would be
the high point of his week.

505
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,883
You have to be absolutely certain.

506
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,641
All right. What is this problem?

507
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,601
I'm worried about Sansa.

508
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,331
When she spoke with Lord Baelish,

509
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,131
his friend warned me about him.

510
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,123
Baelish doesn't have friends.

511
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,925
I don't know her name.

512
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,490
Oh, Ros? The redhead?

513
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,045
How do you know her?

514
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,969
I try to know as many people as I can.

515
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,963
You never know which one you'll need.

516
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,881
She's a whore.

517
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,804
Yes, well, we shouldn't
be judgmental about these things.

518
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,245
You fucked her.

519
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,725
Oh, please.

520
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,844
All right, yes, I fucked her once.

521
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,521
Twice.

522
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:30,490
But since I met you,
my lady, I've been with no one else.

523
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,251
And was she good? Did you like her?

524
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,448
Not as much as I like you, obviously,

525
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,688
or she'd be the one torturing me right now.

526
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,841
What did she say about Littlefinger?

527
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,090
That Sansa shouldn't trust him.

528
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,249
Is there
an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?

529
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,369
We have to protect her.

530
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,646
We can't.

531
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:06,007
Now that the Lannisters have discarded
her, Sansa will have many suitors.

532
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,368
A great beauty with a very old name.

533
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,125
A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty?

534
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,647
Yes, she is, objectively, very.

535
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,611
Her face is quite pleasing,
to other men and to women,

536
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,723
people in general.

537
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,450
But not to me, of course.

538
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,006
I only have eyes for you.

539
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,401
You pervert. You want her?

540
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,050
This child?

541
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,844
I don't even want to talk about her.

542
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,206
But you are.

543
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,560
Only because you're making me.

544
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,847
I didn't force you to open

545
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,207
your mouth and make words come out.

546
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,365
This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.

547
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,368
Aw! "The cruelty. Shae is so cruel to me."

548
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,409
Mmm. Yes.

549
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,967
Now do you think I'm cruel?

550
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,684
Only if you stop.

551
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,360
But you mustn't come here again.

552
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,642
Do you hear me?

553
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,326
You've come to a dangerous place
full of dangerous people.

554
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,081
Dangerous people. Mmm.

555
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,770
Lady Tyrell, my king.

556
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,370
Send her in.

557
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,562
You wanted to see me, Your Grace?

558
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,324
I'm leaving on a hunting trip.

559
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,689
I just wanted to make sure
you had everything you need before I left.

560
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,643
That's very thoughtful, Your Grace.

561
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,564
I have everything I could want.

562
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,005
Good. Good.

563
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,887
How are you finding life in the capital?

564
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,321
It must be quite a change after Renly's camp.

565
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,209
A welcome one.

566
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,524
A military encampment is no place for a lady.

567
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,207
And the bedside of a traitor?

568
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,962
Is that a place for a lady?

569
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,365
Your Grace,

570
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,363
I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all.

571
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,569
What was your duty to
this traitor as you saw it?

572
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,771
The duty of any wife
to any husband. To provide him with children.

573
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,763
You failed to do this.

574
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,289
- Why?

575
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,408
I would not speak ill of the dead.

576
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,765
You think one
ought to speak kindly of a traitor

577
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,729
'cause he had a sword put through his heart?

578
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,647
No. I do beg your pardon.

579
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,042
The subtleties of politics are often lost on me.

580
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,804
Renly...

581
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:16,168
I don't believe
he was interested in the company of women.

582
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,491
What makes you say this?

583
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:25,566
Whenever I wanted to
make a child with him, he...

584
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,845
He had so many excuses,
so many late-night war councils.

585
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,368
He never wanted to try.

586
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,450
Except one evening,

587
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:43,367
after he'd had far too much wine to
drink, he suggested something...

588
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,731
Something that sounded very painful

589
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,491
and couldn't possibly result in children.

590
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,450
Maybe the fault was with me.

591
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:01,128
No, he was a known degenerate.

592
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,523
It's such a relief
to hear you say so, Your Grace.

593
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,250
Mmm.

594
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:10,962
I've considered
making his perversion punishable by death.

595
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,284
As is your right.

596
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:19,208
You must do whatever you need to do.

597
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,286
You are the king.

598
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,566
Yes.

599
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,000
I am.

600
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,521
Do you like it?

601
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,523
I just had it made. Probably one of

602
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,483
the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.

603
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,006
It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works?

604
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,371
It's a new design.
Much easier to load. There's no crank.

605
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,206
You use this lever to draw the string.

606
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,322
The bolt goes here.

607
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:12,482
And then you just aim...

608
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,851
And...

609
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,691
Would you take me hunting sometime?

610
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,967
Forgive me, Your Grace.
I know a hunt is no place for a woman.

611
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,451
It's not unheard of.

612
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,887
My father would never let me before...

613
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,201
You no longer belong to him.

614
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,284
Do you want to hold it?

615
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,089
May I? Please.

616
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,644
I imagine it must
be so exciting to squeeze your finger here

617
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,200
and watch something die over there.

618
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,129
Could you do it?

619
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,441
Could you kill something?

620
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,801
I don't know, Your Grace.
Do you think I could?

621
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,166
Yes.

622
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,647
Would you like to watch me?

623
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,409
Yes.

624
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,525
Stop! Stop!

625
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,641
Tell us the truth.

626
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,807
About what?

627
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,847
I don't know what you want.

628
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,161
I want the truth.

629
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,605
What truth?

630
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,051
Why'd you take Winterfell?

631
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,442
I took it to... I took it...

632
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,965
- Who gave the orders?
- No one.

633
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,485
- I took it on my own.
- Why?

634
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,683
To take the North while vulnerable.

635
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,125
And once you took it?

636
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,725
Hold it. Rule it.

637
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,564
Good. That's very good.

638
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,203
Why did you do that? I told you.

639
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,884
Why did you take Winterfell?

640
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,282
I took it to bring glory
to my house and my father.

641
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:16,605
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
I took it because I hated the Starks.

642
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,322
I hated them for
holding me prisoner. I wanted to hurt them.

643
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,483
What are you doing?

644
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,642
Please.

645
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:44,010
I'll tell you
anything. Just take it off.

646
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,650
Please. Please, just take it off.

647
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,403
- Your sister sent me.
- Yara?

648
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,602
I'll come for you tonight
when the castle sleeps.

649
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,241
No, don't go. Please, please.
No, please don't leave me.

650
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,764
Please, please. Please, please don't go!

651
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,322
Please. Please. Don't leave me.

652
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,488
Please don't go.

653
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,042
Rickon, stay with us.

654
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,489
It's all right. The wolves will protect him.

655
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,331
You can get inside his head,
see through his eyes.

656
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,640
Only when I'm asleep.

657
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,326
That's how it begins
until you learn to control it.

658
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,447
You're a warg.

659
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:58,926
It's not just wolves.
Sometimes in my dreams there's a...

660
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,331
A three-eyed raven?

661
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,805
You've seen it?

662
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,127
We saw him together. You haven't forgotten?

663
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,848
Does it have anything to do with warging?

664
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,766
No, the raven is
something different, something deeper.

665
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,481
The raven brings the sight.

666
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,681
Seeing things that haven't happened yet?

667
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,842
Or things that happened
long before you were born

668
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:22,367
or things that are happening right
now thousands of miles away.

669
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,004
What's he telling him?

670
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,242
Why don't you ask?

671
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:32,002
Isn't he ashamed,
your brother, needing you to protect him?

672
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,124
Where's the shame in that?

673
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,882
Any boy his age who needs
his sister to protect him

674
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,322
is gonna find himself
needing lots of protecting.

675
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,326
Some people will always need help.

676
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,601
That doesn't mean they're not worth helping.

677
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,489
When my father died, I dreamt it.

678
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,568
You didn't dream it. You saw it. So did I.

679
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,801
You have the sight, too?

680
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,365
When I told my father about your father,

681
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,569
for the first time in my life, I saw him cry.

682
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,449
Your father is Howland Reed?

683
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,165
Yeah.

684
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,323
He saved my father's life during the rebellion.

685
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,131
Your father told you about the rebellion?

686
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:28,005
Mine never did. But I saw that, too.

687
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,331
What else have you seen?

688
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,485
Only one thing that matters,

689
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,811
You.

690
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,047
I never liked the skinny ones.
Like drinking from a puddle.

691
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,524
Not that I'm averse to
drinking from a puddle every now and again.

692
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,284
I don't drink ale.

693
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,330
There's no story so good
a drink won't make it better.

694
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,050
- Yeah!
- You see?

695
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,368
They've suffered through my bouts of

696
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,528
sobriety. It's very tedious for all concerned.

697
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,204
Now, how did three children...

698
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,010
We're not children.

699
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,287
How did three young persons
such as yourselves,

700
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:15,490
untrained in the art of war,
escape from Harrenhal?

701
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,807
Gendry's a smith.
He was apprenticed in the armory.

702
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,321
A smith, eh? Where'd you train?

703
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,562
King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop.

704
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,608
That criminal. He charges twice as much

705
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,722
as every other armorer in the city.

706
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,723
- That's because he's twice as good.
- Ah-ha!

707
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,131
A smith and a salesman.

708
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,650
- Gendry stole us weapons.
- Ah!

709
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,002
Fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see.

710
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,007
He knows how to use a sword and so do I.

711
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,880
My brothers taught me.

712
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,083
Ooh!

713
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,491
To your brothers!

714
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,929
You can finish your meals before you go.

715
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,963
It may be awhile before you see another.

716
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,205
You'll free us?

717
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,765
I gave you my word.

718
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,289
But before you go,

719
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,446
allow me to raise a cup to your...

720
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,409
Hey, hey.

721
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,931
Now that is an uncommonly large person.

722
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,368
How does one manage to subdue
such an uncommonly large person?

723
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,006
One waits for him to drink until he passes out.

724
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,686
Poor man. You have my sympathy.

725
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,005
Aha!

726
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,404
Not a man at all.

727
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,322
A Hound!

728
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,726
So good to see you again, Clegane.

729
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,768
Thoros?

730
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,731
The fuck you doing here?

731
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,245
Drinking and talking too much. Same as ever.

732
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,850
A pretty prize, lads.

733
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,650
Yeah!

734
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,844
Girl.

735
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:26,570
What in seven hells
are you doing with the Stark bitch?

736
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,928
It's a tough decision.

737
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,925
Take the bridge
and risk being seen or cross the great water.

738
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,206
Silence.

739
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,521
Anyone can see us on the bridge,

740
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,770
but cross by water
and the current could take us.

741
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,604
Or I could escape down the river.

742
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,489
Good luck.

743
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,771
It's wonderful to watch you
wrestle with these dilemmas.

744
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,047
Which will she choose?

745
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,209
Gambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed.

746
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,282
Be quick about it.

747
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,689
- Oh, I need to rest.
- Get up.

748
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,331
I have these,
on your feet when you walk too far.

749
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,811
- What do you call them?
- Get up now.

750
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,167
Corns. I never used to get corns.

751
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:31,846
I used to ride everywhere,
not march around like a common foot soldier

752
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,281
wearing the same shit boots for over a year.

753
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,886
This heel is ruined. There's no way...

754
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,609
I never understood why some knights

755
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,404
felt the need to carry two swords.

756
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,201
Ooh!

757
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,043
You move well

758
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,202
for a great beast of a woman.

759
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,291
You shouldn't grimace before you
lunge. It gives away the game.

760
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:42,764
Bit of a quandary for you.
If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark.

761
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,087
But if you don't kill me,

762
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,245
I'm going to kill you.

763
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:58,047
You're good. Graceless, but good.

764
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:11,321
See? If you were willing to hurt
me, you might have had me there.

765
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,969
Looks like your woman's
getting the better of you,

766
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,929
if you can call that a woman.

767
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,210
We enjoy a good fight.
Gets our juices flowing.

768
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:09,004
The Flayed Man
of House Bolton. A bit gruesome for my taste.

769
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,401
You sure he's the one?

770
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,130
That's him, all right.

771
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,249
I saw him fight at
the tourney for Ser Willem Frey's wedding.

772
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,488
Give the man his silver.

773
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,651
Let us go and
my father will pay you whatever you want.

774
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,929
Enough to buy me a new head?

775
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,844
If the King in the North
hears I let the Kingslayer go,

776
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:33,526
he'll be taking it right off.

777
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,244
I'd rather he takes yours.

1
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,005
If I may, nephew,

2
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,686
I encountered a situation
with one of my lieutenants

3
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,922
at the Stone Mill which
may have some bearing...

4
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,402
Why don't you shut your mouth
about that damned mill?

5
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,131
And don't call him "nephew." He is your king.

6
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,645
Robb knows I meant him no...

7
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,281
You're lucky I'm not your king.

8
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,842
I wouldn't let you wave your blunders
around like a victory flag.

9
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,651
My blunder sent Tywin's mad dog

10
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,564
back to Casterly Rock
with his tail between his legs.

11
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,961
I think King Robb understands
we won't win this war

12
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,246
if he's the only one winning any battles.

13
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,045
No, there's glory enough to go around.

14
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,963
It's not about glory.

15
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,451
Your instructions were to
wait for him to come to you.

16
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,806
I seized an opportunity.

17
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,206
What value was the mill?

18
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,042
The Mountain was garrisoned
across the river from it.

19
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,565
Is he there now?

20
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,042
Of course not. We took the fight to
him. He could not withstand us.

21
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,363
I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west,

22
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,445
into our country,
where we could surround him and kill him.

23
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,727
I wanted him to chase us,

24
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,043
which he would have done
because he is a mad dog

25
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,242
without a strategic thought in his head.

26
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,369
I could have that head on a spike by now.

27
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,241
Instead, I have a mill.

28
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,326
We took hostages.
Willem Lannister. Martyn Lannister.

29
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,880
Willem and Martyn Lannister are 14 years old.

30
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,361
Martyn is 15, I believe.

31
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,201
Tywin Lannister has my sisters.

32
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,803
Have I sued for peace?

33
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,245
No.

34
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,843
Do you think he'll
sue for peace because we have his father's

35
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,764
brother's great-grandsons?

36
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,005
No.

37
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,969
How many men did you lose?

38
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,167
208.
But for every man we lost, the Lannisters...

39
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,050
We need our men more than Tywin needs his!

40
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,322
I'm sorry.

41
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,401
I didn't know.

42
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,561
You would have.

43
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,008
Right here today
at this gathering, if you had been patient.

44
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,163
We seem to be running short of patience here.

45
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,641
You know who isn't?

46
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,209
Tywin Lannister.

47
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,447
Intimate. Lovely table.

48
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,331
Better chairs than
the old Small Council chamber.

49
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,205
Conveniently close
to your own quarters. I like it.

50
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,404
What news of Jaime?

51
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,771
20,000 unwashed Northerners
have known about his escape for weeks.

52
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,048
You control more spies and informants

53
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,242
than the rest of the world combined.

54
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,291
Do you mean to tell me that none of you
has any notion of where he is?

55
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,691
We are trying, my lord.

56
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,171
Try harder.

57
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,364
What do we have, then?

58
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,489
Robb Stark and
most of his bannermen are in Riverrun

59
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,321
for the funeral
of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully.

60
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:08,406
In Stark's absence,
Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal,

61
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,927
which would seem
to make him Lord of Harrenhal,

62
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,001
in practice, not in name.

63
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,167
Let him have it.

64
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,968
The name suits our purposes
far more than that useless pile of rubble.

65
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,530
The Lord of Harrenhal will make

66
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,130
a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.

67
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,283
For which I am
extremely grateful to you, my lord.

68
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,727
Lady Arryn and I have known each
other since we were children.

69
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,840
She has always been
positively predisposed toward me.

70
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,446
A successful courtship would make

71
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,086
Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale.

72
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,970
Titles do seem to breed titles.

73
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,929
You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible

74
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,929
and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold.

75
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,082
Then the young wolf can add his own aunt

76
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,891
to the list of people who have
taken up arms against him.

77
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,930
Far be it from me to hinder true love,

78
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,244
but Lord Baelish's
absence would present certain problems.

79
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,687
The royal wedding may end up being

80
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,286
the most expensive event in living memory.

81
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,250
Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead.

82
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,086
Not a good time
to leave the crown's finances unattended.

83
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,208
Fully agreed.

84
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,409
Which is why I'm naming you
new Master of Coin.

85
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,482
Master of Coin?

86
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,166
It would appear to best suits your talents.

87
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,969
I'm quite good at spending money,

88
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,883
but a lifetime of outrageous wealth

89
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,883
hasn't taught me much about managing it.

90
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,487
I have no doubt
you will prove equal to this challenge.

91
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,324
Hear, hear.

92
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,483
He lifted her high in the air

93
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,767
He sniffed and roared and smelled her there

94
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,002
She kicked and wailed, the maid so fair

95
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,560
But he licked the honey from her hair

96
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,647
From there to here, from here to there

97
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,848
All black and brown and covered with hair

98
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,048
He smelled that girl on the summer air

99
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,600
The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair

100
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,165
I hope you're pleased.
If I were armed, they'd never have taken us.

101
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,242
You were armed
when we were taken.

102
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,209
I was in chains, if you recall.

103
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,080
Our little match would have ended quite
quick if my hands weren't bound.

104
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,369
All my life I've been
hearing, "Jaime Lannister,

105
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,169
"what a brilliant swordsman."

106
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,170
You were slower
than I expected. And more predictable.

107
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,924
I've been sitting in a muddy pen,

108
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,690
wrapped in chains, for the past year.

109
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,683
I'm a woman. I was beating you.

110
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,001
You were not beating me.

111
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,287
Maybe you were as good as people said...

112
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,283
Once.

113
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,443
Or maybe people just
love to over-praise a famous name.

114
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,685
When we make camp tonight,
you'll be raped. More than once.

115
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,644
None of these fellows
have ever been with a noblewoman.

116
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,207
- You'd be wise not to resist.
- Would I?

117
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,645
They'll knock your teeth out.

118
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,131
You think I care?

119
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,567
No, I don't think you care about your teeth.

120
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,206
If you fight them,
they will kill you. Do you understand?

121
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,891
I'm the prisoner of value, not you.

122
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,406
Let them have
what they want. What does it matter?

123
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,527
What does it matter?

124
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,601
Close your eyes.

125
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,284
Pretend they're Renly.

126
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,527
If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist?

127
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,927
You'd let them do what they wanted?

128
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,245
If I was a woman, I'd make them kill
me. But I'm not, thank the Gods.

129
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,002
If I had a proper forge,
I'd make it good as new.

130
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,404
Doesn't have to look pretty.
It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart.

131
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,409
Why are you helping him?

132
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,602
He takes us prisoner, now he's our friend?

133
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,250
You're not our prisoner.

134
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,481
What am I?

135
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,607
Our guest.

136
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,648
No one's put any chains on you.

137
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,165
So I can walk away, then?

138
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,045
These woods aren't safe
for Ned Stark's daughter.

139
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,401
You're lucky we found you.

140
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,727
You think
you're good with that bow, you little twat?

141
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,290
Better than anyone you've met.

142
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,605
A coward's weapon.
I like to fight up close.

143
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,127
I like to see a man's face
when I put the steel in him.

144
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,771
Why? So you can kiss him?

145
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,683
You remember the last time you were here?

146
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,282
Looks like every other shit inn on the road.

147
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,840
Now, apologies,
but you're one ugly fucker

148
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,082
and I'd rather not see you no more.

149
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,648
Watch your head.

150
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,051
Off we go.

151
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,451
Walk up!

152
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,487
What are you doing? We're about to leave.

153
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,891
I'm staying.

154
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,486
You're what?

155
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,082
I baked brown bread
for the innkeep, she said she never had better.

156
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,128
Told Thoros she's
keeping me as payment for all his free meals.

157
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,728
Anyway, it's not me the Brotherhood
wants. My brother ain't no king.

158
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,450
I'm not a Stark of Winterhell.

159
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,800
Winterfell.

160
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,162
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

161
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,570
Well, I made you something.

162
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,161
What is it?

163
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,570
It's a wolf.

164
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,964
Yes, it is.

165
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,771
That's the tail?

166
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,245
Yeah.

167
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,605
Well, be safe.

168
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,281
Yeah, you, too. Don't get stabbed.

169
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,001
You don't burn your fingers.

170
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,486
Good-bye, Hot Pie.

171
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,491
<i>Good-bye, Arty.</i>

172
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,768
Up you go, little lady.

173
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,005
Hey, Hot Pie.

174
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,684
It's really good.

175
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,686
A person could almost be forgiven
for forgetting we're at war.

176
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,648
It often comforts me
to think that even in war's darkest days,

177
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,090
in most places in
the world absolutely nothing is happening.

178
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,123
I've missed you, Uncle.

179
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,966
Father missed you, too, from the day you left.

180
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,247
Maybe he never said it in so many words...

181
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,924
Maybe?

182
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,287
Your father was a stubborn old ox.

183
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,729
I was surprised when
he died. Didn't think death had the patience.

184
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,409
I'm glad you were
with him. I wish to the Gods I had been.

185
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,044
Did you make peace in the end?

186
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,411
After 30 years of fighting,
I don't think he remembered what started it.

187
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,121
He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish.

188
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,649
He said it was an old joke
and it was never funny to begin with.

189
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,322
I told him people
had been calling me Blackfish for so long,

190
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,562
they don't remember my real name.

191
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,601
Every time he would
leave for the capital or fight in a campaign,

192
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,848
I'd see him off.

193
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,003
"Wait for me, little Cat," he'd say.

194
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,803
"Wait for me, and I'll come back to you."

195
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,088
And I would sit at this window every day
when the sun came up, waiting.

196
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,971
I wonder,

197
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,681
how many times did Bran or Rickon

198
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,041
stare across the moors of Winterfell,

199
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,441
waiting for me to return?

200
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,808
I will never see them again.

201
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,129
You mustn't think it.

202
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:25,324
We don't know the truth.
They could be in hiding.

203
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,843
Robb believes they're alive.

204
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,888
And he must go on believing.

205
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,884
He's got to remain strong if he's to prevail.

206
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,760
And you must remain strong for him.

207
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,685
You're Robb Stark's wife.

208
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,006
Hold still.

209
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,529
Is it true what they say about him?

210
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,008
I don't know. What do they say about him?

211
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,321
That he can turn into a wolf at night.

212
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,084
True.

213
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,447
And he eats the flesh of his enemies.

214
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,363
True.

215
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,328
You're a Lannister, aren't you?

216
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,926
Martyn Lannister.

217
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,207
You've nothing to fear.
My husband doesn't eat children.

218
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,287
Unless it's a full moon.

219
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,204
It's not a full moon tonight, is it?

220
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,205
See? Nothing to fear.

221
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,721
Always the artists.

222
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,571
It's only horses.

223
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,040
No men.

224
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,802
You said there was dead crows.

225
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,121
There was.

226
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,009
How many men were here?

227
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,162
About 300.

228
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,607
And you know what those men are now?

229
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,683
We're all the same to them,
meat for their army.

230
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,641
Do you think anyone got away?

231
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,520
It's not impossible.
You don't go far betting against Mormont.

232
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,162
But dead or alive,
he took a big gamble coming north.

233
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,208
And he lost.

234
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,681
His best fighting men are dead.

235
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,883
And whether
he's Lord Commander of the Night's Watch

236
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,883
or a blue-eyed corpse,

237
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,645
he's a long way from home.

238
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,530
Tormund. Climb the Wall.

239
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,720
Take Orell and 20 good men.
And take this one.

240
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,804
He knows Castle
Black's defenses better than any of us.

241
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,602
And if he's useful,
good. If not, throw him off the Wall.

242
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,445
See if crows can fly.

243
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,842
We're finally going to war, old friend?

244
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,925
Hide near Castle Black.
When I give the signal, hit them in the night.

245
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,403
They've got a big old wall to hide
behind, but it only guards one side.

246
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,285
We'll meet again.

247
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,767
- Aye. If you do your job.
- Ah.

248
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,922
How will we see your signal?

249
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,765
Send your eagle
above the Wall every night.

250
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,446
When it's time, I'm going
to light the biggest fire

251
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,722
the North has ever seen.

252
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,361
Ghost?

253
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,567
What have we here? Frozen crows?

254
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,563
We've come a long way.

255
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,366
Smaller flock
than you went north with.

256
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,568
We can talk inside.

257
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,610
Oh, can we?

258
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,611
They need some water.
Tether it, and I'll be inside.

259
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,362
Keep your eyes where they belong.

260
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,841
They're not for you.

261
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,526
Bet you feed that pig better than you feed us.

262
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,763
Aye, pig's got value to me.

263
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,601
You should all
be kissing my feet for letting you in.

264
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,970
I'd have turned you all away
if I wasn't a godly man.

265
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,327
You are a godly man?

266
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,847
I am. I got no fear of what's out there.

267
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,048
When the white cold comes,

268
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,966
your swords and cloaks
and bloody fires won't help you.

269
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,204
The only ones left
will be those who are right with the Gods.

270
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,924
The real Gods.

271
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,201
Go tell her she can bite down on a rag

272
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,687
or she can bite down on my fist.

273
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,485
Women.

274
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,525
That sow right
there gave birth to a litter of eight.

275
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,683
Barely a grunt.

276
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:37,084
And she's almost as fat as this one here.

277
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,606
Now why don't you dine on him?

278
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,331
Carve off what you need as you go.

279
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,489
Well, look at him. He's a walking feast.

280
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,450
Here we are.
Sharpen these for me, would ya?

281
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,923
I see the head. Push. That's it.

282
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,241
You're nearly there.

283
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,648
One more push should do it.

284
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,922
What is it? What is it?

285
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,969
Keep quiet.

286
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,890
If you can't ride, we don't stand a chance.

287
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,883
I can ride.

288
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,247
You're sure?

289
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,568
Ride east. Follow
the rising sun. Your sister's waiting for you.

290
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,206
I'll make you
a Lord of the Iron Islands for this.

291
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,486
We're not in the Iron Islands.

292
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,806
Go.

293
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,081
Come on.

294
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,562
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

295
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,449
Come on back.

296
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,368
You refuse to
tell me where you're going?

297
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,523
I don't know yet.
The fires will show me.

298
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,840
How long will you be gone?

299
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,240
I don't know.

300
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,444
You're abandoning me.

301
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,164
I will never abandon you.

302
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,162
You are the Son of Fire.

303
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,480
I am sworn to serve you.

304
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,840
Then serve me.

305
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,888
When I return, you will understand.

306
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,567
My enemies think they've destroyed me.

307
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,400
They're laughing at me,
the way Renly laughed at me.

308
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:18,286
I want Joffrey dead. I want Robb Stark dead.

309
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,922
Make me another son.

310
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,604
I cannot.

311
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,886
Why?

312
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,009
You don't have the strength. It would kill you.

313
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,731
I'm not easily killed. Men have tried for years.

314
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,921
I want you.

315
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,488
Your fires burn low, my king.

316
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,406
There is another way. A better way.

317
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,131
You told me your magic
requires a king's blood.

318
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,804
- Yes.
- I'm the one true king.

319
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,370
You are.

320
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,602
There are others
with your blood in their veins.

321
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,521
You will sit on the Iron Throne,

322
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,927
but first there must be sacrifices.

323
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,731
The Lord of Light demands it.

324
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,691
The Walk of Punishment
is a warning, Your Grace.

325
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,250
To whom?

326
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,890
To any slave who contemplates doing

327
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,566
whatever these slaves did.

328
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,927
Give me your water.

329
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,766
Khaleesi, this man
has been sentenced to death.

330
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,651
Here, drink.

331
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,687
Leave this place, Your Grace.

332
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,325
Leave tonight, I beg you.

333
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,010
And what is she to do for soldiers?

334
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,243
We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr.

335
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,846
Is it "we" already, Ser Barristan?

336
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,764
If you want to sit on the throne

337
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,609
your ancestors built, you must win it.

338
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,001
That means blood on
your hands before the thing is done.

339
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,004
The blood of my enemies,
not the blood of innocents.

340
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,641
How many wars
have you fought in, Ser Barristan?

341
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,802
- Three.
- Have you ever seen a war

342
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,360
where innocents didn't die by the thousands?

343
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,044
I was in King's Landing
after the sack, Khaleesi.

344
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,283
You know what I saw? Butchery.

345
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,761
Babies, children, old men.

346
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,161
More women raped than you can count.

347
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,848
There's a beast in every man,
and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand.

348
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,891
But the Unsullied are
not men. They do not rape.

349
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,964
They do not put
cities to the sword unless they're ordered.

350
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:02,602
If you buy them, the only men they'll
kill are those you want dead.

351
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,330
You disagree, Ser Barristan?

352
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,324
When your brother
led his army into battle at the Trident,

353
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,880
men died for him
because they believed in him,

354
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,405
because they loved him,

355
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,051
not because they'd been
bought at an auction.

356
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,566
I fought beside the last dragon on that day.

357
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,329
I bled beside him.

358
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,041
Rhaegar fought valiantly,
Rhaegar fought nobly,

359
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,884
and Rhaegar died.

360
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,529
Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?

361
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,201
I did, Your Grace. Finest man I ever met.

362
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:40,284
I wish I had known him.
But he was not the last dragon.

363
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,401
All?
Did this one's ears mishear, Your Grace?

364
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,641
They did not. I want to buy them all.

365
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,808
She wants to buy them all.

366
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,329
She can't afford them.

367
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,322
The slut thinks she can flash her tits,

368
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,246
and make us give her whatever she wants.

369
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,886
There are 8,000 Unsullied in Astapor.
Is this what you mean by all?

370
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,045
Yes. 8,000.
And the ones still in training as well.

371
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,651
If they fail on the battlefield,

372
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,403
they will shame Astapor.

373
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,962
Master Greizhen says
they cannot sell half-trained boys.

374
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,208
If they fail on the battlefield,

375
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,482
they will bring shame upon all of Astapor.

376
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,562
I will have them all or take none.

377
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,324
Many will fall in battle. I'll need the boys

378
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,164
to pick up the swords they drop.

379
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,602
The slut cannot pay for all of this.

380
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,009
Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this.

381
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,084
Her ship will buy her 100 Unsullied, no more,

382
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,242
Your ship will buy you 100 Unsullied.

383
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,482
And this because I like the curve of her ass.

384
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,686
Because Master Kraznys is generous.

385
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,888
What is left will buy her 10.

386
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,803
The gold
you have left is worth 10.

387
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,450
I will give her 20
if it stops her ignorant whimpering.

388
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,602
But good Master Kraznys will give you 20.

389
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,766
Her Dothraki smell of shit,

390
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,285
The Dothraki you have with you...

391
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,921
but may be useful as pig feed.

392
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,645
The Dothraki you have
are not worth what they cost to feed...

393
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,561
I will give her 3 for those.

394
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,687
...but Master
Kraznys will give you

395
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,841
three Unsullied for all of them.

396
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,047
So, ask this beggar queen,

397
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,531
Master Kraznys asks
how you propose to pay...

398
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,171
how will she pay
for the remaining 7,877?

399
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:39,086
...for
the remaining 7,877 Unsullied?

400
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,570
I have dragons. I'll give you one.

401
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,126
You will win the throne with
dragons, not slaves, Your Grace.

402
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,811
Khaleesi, please.

403
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,604
Three dragons.

404
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,920
- One.
- Two.

405
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,206
One.

406
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,002
They want the biggest one.

407
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,447
Done.

408
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,926
I'll take you as well, now.

409
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,401
You'll be Master Kraznys' gift to me.

410
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,921
A token of a bargain well struck.

411
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,450
She asks that you give me
to her, as a present.

412
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,762
She asks that you do this now.

413
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,961
Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more

414
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,287
than any army. Aegon Targaryen proved that.

415
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,450
You're both here to advise me.

416
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,409
I value your advice, but if you ever

417
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,409
question me in front of strangers again,

418
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,084
you'll be advising someone else.

419
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,211
Is that understood?

420
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,724
Do you have a name?

421
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,406
This one's name is Missandei, Your Grace.

422
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,482
Do you have a family? A mother and a father

423
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,642
you'd return to if you had the choice?

424
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,042
No, Your Grace. No family living.

425
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,164
You belong to me now.
It is your duty to tell me the truth.

426
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,766
Yes, Your Grace. Lying is a great offense.

427
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,242
Many of those on the Walk of
Punishment were taken there for less.

428
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,971
I offered water to
a slave dying on the Walk of Punishment.

429
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,203
Do you know
what he said to me? "Let me die."

430
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,965
There are no masters
in the grave, Your Grace.

431
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,367
Is it true what Master Kraznys told me

432
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,767
about the Unsullied? About their obedience?

433
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:49,448
All questions have
been taken from them. They obey, that is all.

434
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,171
Once they are yours, they are yours.

435
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,368
They will fall on their swords
if you command it.

436
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,887
And what about you?
You know that I'm taking you to war.

437
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,282
You may go hungry. You may fall sick.

438
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,088
You may be killed.

439
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,889
Valar Morghulis.

440
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,407
Yes, all men must die.

441
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,562
But we are not men.

442
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,048
A surprising place
to keep the royal ledgers.

443
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,043
I'm surprised you're surprised.

444
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,321
This is the safest place in the city.

445
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,129
Not for bastards.

446
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,650
That's all of them, my lord.

447
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,530
Thank you, my dear. Pod.

448
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,841
Pod. Take them outside.

449
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,126
I'll be there in a moment.

450
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,446
Yes, my lord.

451
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,562
I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.

452
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,326
Only my life.
Not all that significant, I'm afraid.

453
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,368
You should have him knighted.

454
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,683
If only the Master of Coin had such power.

455
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,608
If only.

456
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,961
I owe you a significant debt.

457
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,407
Our redheaded friend.

458
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,211
You secured her release
when the Queen detained her.

459
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,044
Oh, that.

460
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,243
Of course. A simple misunderstanding.

461
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,129
Apparently, Her Grace believed

462
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,205
that you two had
some sort of special relationship.

463
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,170
We don't. I did fuck her once.

464
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,288
- I know.
- But we don't.

465
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,885
I know.

466
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,564
How'd the Queen get that idea?

467
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,405
Why don't you ask her?

468
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,922
Any advice for me on my new position?

469
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,924
Keep a low profile.

470
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,051
If I had a gold dragon

471
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,408
for every time
I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are.

472
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,323
Well, you are richer than I am.

473
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,402
Good point.

474
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,563
They're only numbers. Numbers on paper.

475
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,247
Once you understand that,
it's easy to make them behave.

476
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,087
Trivial even.
You want a real challenge? Try whores.

477
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:20,803
I've tried quite a few.
Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie.

478
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,766
Come on, I'm here later. Come on.

479
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,845
Tonight, then.

480
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,765
Looks like dull reading.

481
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,081
You think all reading is dull reading.

482
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,970
It's an opinion I share
with some of the finest men I know.

483
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,566
The secret history
of the Seven Kingdoms is in these pages.

484
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,371
Unless Lord Twatbeard
made up a bunch of numbers

485
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,010
to hide what he's really up to.

486
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,128
Unless he made it all up, yes.

487
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,281
Podrick, do keep up.

488
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,407
Yes, my lord.

489
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,606
Podrick.

490
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,761
Yes, my lord?

491
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,128
After a long consultation
with my colleague Ser Bronn,

492
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,771
I finally found
a suitable reward for the services

493
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,089
you've provided over and
above what might be considered reasonable.

494
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:09,371
Tell me, Pod,
have you ever been with a woman?

495
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,521
No, my lord.

496
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,687
Wonderful.

497
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:17,285
Genna specializes in first-timers.

498
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,966
She's not bad with second-timers, either.

499
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,849
Uh, my lord...

500
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,526
A fair enough repayment
for putting your spear

501
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,968
through my
would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say?

502
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,564
Now, as it happens,

503
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,085
Marei

504
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,243
is quite the spear-handler herself.

505
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,483
She's here to thank you for staying by my side

506
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,809
as the battle raged all around me.

507
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,769
He's handsome.

508
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,281
You didn't tell me he was handsome.

509
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,882
Kayla is famous
from here to Volantis in certain circles.

510
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:02,646
One of four women in the world who can
perform a proper Meereenese Knot.

511
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,724
My lord, I don't even...

512
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,328
She's here to thank
you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow,

513
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,051
who's never once failed
to address me as "my lord."

514
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,283
Be back in time for my supper.

515
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,404
Pace yourself, lad.

516
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,123
For years
I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician.

517
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,490
Whenever the crown needs
money, he rubs his hands together

518
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,126
and, poof, mountains of gold.

519
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,521
Let me guess. He's not a magician.

520
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,726
No.

521
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,291
He's stealing it?

522
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,845
Worse, he's borrowing it.

523
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,610
What's wrong with that?

524
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,082
We can't afford
to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it.

525
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,441
The crown owes millions to my father.

526
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,966
Seeing as it's
his grandson's ass on the throne,

527
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,048
I imagine he'll forgive that debt.

528
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,282
Forgive a debt, my father?

529
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,931
For a man of the world,
you're strangely naive.

530
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,650
I've never borrowed money.

531
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,163
- I'm not clear on the rules.
- Well...

532
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,642
The basic principle is, I lend you money,

533
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:22,011
and after an agreed upon period of
time, you return it with interest.

534
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,361
What if I don't?

535
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,491
Well, you have to.

536
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,001
But what if I don't?

537
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,448
This is why I don't lend you money.

538
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,600
Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about.

539
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,728
It's the Iron Bank of Braavos.

540
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,689
We owe them tens of millions.

541
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,808
If we fail to repay these loans,

542
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,002
the bank will fund our enemies.

543
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,209
One way or another,
they always get their gold back.

544
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,930
Ah, the return of the conquering hero.

545
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,321
Does he have a little jaunt in his step?

546
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,970
The lad's practically skipping.

547
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,522
You were gone a long time.
I trust you got your money's worth.

548
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,130
Or should I say my money's worth?

549
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,884
Oh, it was a gift, Podrick.
This is more than I give you in a year.

550
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,247
He's a squire. You don't pay him.

551
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,408
Oh, then it's much more
than I give you in a year.

552
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,051
They wouldn't take it, my lord.

553
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,763
Maybe they're trying to curry some
favor with the new Master of Coin.

554
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,808
Have you ever known a whore
to turn down gold?

555
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,847
They were happy enough
to take it when I gave it to them.

556
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,684
What did you tell them?

557
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,330
I didn't tell them anything.

558
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,811
What did you do to them?

559
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,405
Lots of things.

560
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,323
And they seemed to like these things?

561
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,970
Yes, my lord.

562
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,010
Of course they did.
They're paid to seem to like it.

563
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,447
Only they weren't paid.

564
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,285
What are you saying?
These ladies enjoyed him so much,

565
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,044
they gave him the time for free?

566
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,321
Is that what you're telling us?

567
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,166
Sit down, Podrick.

568
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,929
We're going to need details.

569
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,528
Copious details.

570
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,729
Come on! Come on!

571
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,566
Come on! Come on.

572
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,329
You know how we deal with runaways?

573
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,091
Take off his pants.

574
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,165
No! No! No, no, no!

575
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,322
I'm gonna fuck you into the dirt.

576
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,240
No, please! No, no, no! No, don't!

577
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,726
No, please! No! No!

578
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,608
You little bastard.

579
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,449
Come, my lord.

580
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:34,442
You're a long way from home,
and winter is coming.

581
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,567
I'll take the big bitch first.

582
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,087
When she's good
and wet, you lot can finish her off.

583
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,680
My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth.

584
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,081
Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me

585
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,521
to deliver Ser Jaime to King's Landing.

586
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,762
Catelyn Stark's a treasonous cunt.

587
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,287
Orders were to take the Kingslayer
alive. Nobody said shit about you.

588
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,245
You're only making it worse.

589
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:35,130
Take her over there,
where it's dark. I'd like a little privacy.

590
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,171
Come on!

591
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,962
You know who she is, don't you?

592
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,887
A big dumb bitch from who cares where.

593
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,249
Never been with a woman that big.

594
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,084
She's Brienne of Tarth.

595
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:09,290
Her father is
Lord Selwyn Tarth. Heard of Tarth?

596
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,164
I'm gonna cut your throat!

597
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,323
They call it
the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why?

598
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,881
Every sapphire in Westeros
was mined on Tarth.

599
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,527
Sapphires are gemstones.

600
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,125
The blue ones.

601
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,810
I know what they are.

602
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,571
Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight

603
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,251
in sapphires if she's returned to him.

604
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:39,365
But only if she's alive,
her honor unbesmirched.

605
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,888
Bring her back here.

606
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,530
Yes, my lord.

607
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,687
Get up.

608
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:55,881
Come on.

609
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,440
Come on, on your feet.

610
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,968
Unbesmirched.

611
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,727
Not defiled.

612
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,485
Fancy word for a fancy man.

613
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,246
I hated to read as a child,

614
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:15,005
but my father forced me
to study every morning

615
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,646
before I could practice with sword or horse.

616
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,760
Two hours every day
holed up in the maester's chambers.

617
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:25,003
I learned a lot of fancy words.

618
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,242
I bet you did.

619
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:40,208
Your father,
he'd pay your weight in gold to get you back?

620
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,930
You'll be a rich man till the end of your days.

621
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,005
And your sons
will be rich men, and their sons after them.

622
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,447
Lands, titles...

623
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,682
You'll have them all.

624
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,443
The North can't win this war.

625
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,648
You're a smart man. You understand that.

626
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,842
We have the numbers. We have the gold.

627
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,008
Aye, you have both.

628
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:10,684
Fighting bravely
for a losing cause is admirable.

629
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:16,481
Fighting for a winning cause
is far more rewarding.

630
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,885
Hard to argue with that.

631
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,210
Now that we're speaking together man to man,

632
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,649
I wonder if you need
to keep me chained to this tree?

633
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,963
I'm not asking to be freed
from my constraints,

634
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,281
but if I could sleep lying down,

635
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,641
my back would thank you for it.

636
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,404
I'm not as young and resilient as I was once.

637
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,408
None of us are.

638
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,888
Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree.

639
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,291
Come on, men.

640
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:00,163
Suppose you'll be wanting something to eat.

641
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,208
I'm famished, actually.

642
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:05,204
I think we've got a spare partridge on the fire.

643
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,965
Well, I do like partridge.

644
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:17,406
Bring the bird over here and the carving knife.

645
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,491
Will this work as a table, my lord?

646
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,324
Oh, yes. Yes, this will do...

647
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,611
On the stump.

648
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,969
You think you're the smartest man there is.

649
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:46,085
That everyone alive
has to bow and scrape and lick your boots.

650
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,286
My father...

651
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,561
And if you get in any trouble,

652
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,723
all you've got to do is say "my father"

653
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,644
and that's it, all your troubles are gone.

654
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,720
Don't.

655
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,171
Have you got something to say?

656
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,484
Careful. You don't want
to say the wrong thing.

657
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:15,080
You're nothing without your
daddy, and your daddy ain't here.

658
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,088
Never forget that.

659
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,690
Here, this should help you remember.

1
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,169
How many of those fingers do you think
we could shove up his ass?

2
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,811
Depends if he's had any practice.

3
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,963
That the sort of thing
you and your sister go in for?

4
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,405
She loosened you up for us?

5
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,326
He's going to fall.

6
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,681
He's going to fall off his horse. Help him.

7
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,883
Water.

8
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,327
Water. Please, water.

9
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,691
Water. Water, please. Please. Please.

10
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,203
If I die, you won't be getting...

11
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,691
Oh, enough.

12
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,728
Here.

13
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,128
Can't say that I've ever seen a
man drink horse piss that fast.

14
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,360
Stop!

15
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,525
Far enough.

16
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,761
Do that again and I'll take your other hand.

17
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,041
Come on, you.

18
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,486
Oh, Lord Tyrion. Come in, come in.

19
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,360
I hope we might speak in confidence.

20
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,926
Oh. Always in confidence.

21
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,446
About the events of the Blackwater.

22
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,005
Perhaps this is the wrong time?

23
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,610
Oh, no, it's a wonderful time.

24
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,888
I thought one of your little birds might

25
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,088
have knowledge of my sister's intentions to...

26
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,964
End your life?

27
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,849
I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies

28
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,769
along with his position, I'm afraid.

29
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,329
Which is why I'm coming to you. I need proof.

30
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,641
Proof? Will there be a trial?

31
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,767
I need to know.

32
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,084
I have no proof, only whispers.

33
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,683
Before all this nastiness,

34
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,606
I was going to tell you
the story of how I was cut.

35
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,966
Do you want to hear it still?

36
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,804
I don't know. Do I?

37
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,162
As a boy, I traveled with a troupe of
actors through the Free Cities.

38
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,208
One day in Myr,

39
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,928
a certain man made
my master an offer too tempting to refuse.

40
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,287
I feared the man meant to use me

41
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,681
as I'd heard some men used small boys.

42
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,286
But what he wanted was far worse.

43
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,241
He gave me a potion
that made me powerless to move or speak,

44
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,324
yet did nothing to dull my senses.

45
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,971
With a hooked blade he sliced me,

46
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,726
root and stem, chanting all the while.

47
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,247
He burned my parts in a brazier.

48
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,486
The flames turned blue,
and I heard a voice answer his call.

49
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,086
I still dream of that night.

50
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,802
Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade.

51
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,361
I dream of the voice from the flames.

52
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,240
Was it a god? A demon? A conjuror's trick?

53
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,561
I don't know.

54
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,928
But the sorcerer called and a voice answered.

55
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,246
And ever since that day, I have hated magic
and all those who practice it.

56
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,051
But you can see why I was eager to aid in your

57
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,925
fight against Stannis and his red priestess.

58
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,571
A symbolic revenge of sorts.

59
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,801
Yes.

60
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,483
I feel the need for actual revenge against

61
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,763
the actual person who tried to have me killed,

62
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,603
which will require
a degree of influence, which...

63
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,810
You do not possess at the moment.

64
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,284
But influence is
largely a matter of patience, I have found.

65
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,250
Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose,

66
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,284
he threw me out of his house to die.

67
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,524
I resolved to live to spite him.

68
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,125
I begged.

69
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,283
I sold what parts of my body remained to me.

70
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,647
I became an excellent thief,

71
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,281
and soon learned that
the contents of a man's letters

72
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,166
are more valuable
than the contents of his purse.

73
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,485
Step by step,
one distasteful task after another,

74
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,124
I made my way from the slums of Myr
to the Small Council chamber.

75
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,090
Influence grows like a weed.

76
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,011
I tended mine patiently

77
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,368
until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep

78
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,802
all the way across to the far side of the world,

79
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,966
where I managed
to wrap them around something very special.

80
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,844
Ugh.

81
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,081
The sorcerer.

82
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,843
Hello, my old friend.

83
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,163
It's been a long time.

84
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,962
I have no doubt
the revenge you want will be yours in time,

85
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,004
if you have the stomach for it.

86
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,447
When people talk about the Night's Watch,

87
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,887
they never mention the shoveling.

88
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,201
Or the shit.

89
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,282
They tell you about honor,

90
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,368
pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm,

91
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,843
but shoveling really is most of it.

92
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,003
And getting attacked or killed or worse.

93
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,161
And that.

94
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,449
But when you're not getting attacked or
killed, usually you're shoveling.

95
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,803
Ah, look. More shit.

96
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,726
I was starting to wonder
what to do with the rest of me day.

97
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,928
We need to get out of here.

98
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,686
When the Lord Commander
says we go, we go.

99
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,730
The Lord Commander
told us to go to the Fist of the First Men.

100
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,086
How'd that turn out for us?

101
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,440
He had no way of knowing.

102
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,569
We do now. We know what's out there.

103
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,928
Craster's been out here surviving.

104
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,925
So he's your
new protector now? Our good friend Craster?

105
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,764
We're like the sons he never had.

106
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,161
Mormont isn't gonna save you.

107
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,449
This lummox here isn't gonna save you.

108
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,082
When the Walkers come calling, Craster will
serve us up like so many pigs.

109
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,162
If we want to live,

110
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,441
we'll have to look out for ourselves.

111
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,521
You woke him.

112
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,401
I'm sorry.

113
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,047
- He's beautiful.
- Shh!

114
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,564
He's beautiful.

115
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,568
- Does he have a name?
- No.

116
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,330
Are you going to give him one?

117
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,731
Why?

118
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,445
- Here.
- Gilly.

119
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,602
You said to hold it for you
until you came back.

120
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,091
- You're back.
- I wanted you to have it.

121
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,605
I don't want your stupid thimble.

122
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,567
I want to save
my baby's life. Can you do that?

123
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,646
Can you?

124
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,288
I don't have time for you.

125
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,091
I don't have time for anyone but him

126
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,931
because he doesn't have much time.

127
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,367
You have to go after him.

128
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,329
How?

129
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,289
You know how.

130
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,286
Brandon.

131
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,329
- Mother.
- How many times have I told you?

132
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,881
No climbing.

133
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,724
Mother, I need to find it.
It's here. It's calling me.

134
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,804
I want you to promise me.
No more climbing. Promise me.

135
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,564
Promise me! Promise me!

136
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,641
Mother! Mother!

137
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,801
Promise me, Bran!

138
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,081
Promise me!

139
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,285
Is he very large?

140
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,328
No larger than usual, apparently.

141
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,845
And yet, they said that he was...

142
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,325
Extraordinary.

143
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,445
The most extraordinary man they've ever
had. And they've had a lot of men.

144
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,409
We're talking about the same Podrick?

145
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,530
The quiet boy in
Lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple?

146
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,485
What did he do to them?

147
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,965
I don't know, my lord.

148
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,287
The girls are usually quite descriptive.

149
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,203
So what did they say?

150
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,363
They said it was hard to describe.

151
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,441
Huh.

152
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,804
Prodigies appear in the oddest of places.

153
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,965
And what did
Littlefinger say about this loss of income?

154
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,008
He was too preoccupied to notice.

155
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,088
He's leaving for the Eyrie soon.

156
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,049
I'm helping him prepare for his journey.

157
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,044
Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the

158
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,124
Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her.

159
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,328
Sad, really.

160
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,721
Is that all it takes to make our friend

161
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,281
lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?

162
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,728
He hasn't spoken to her
since the last time, as far as I know.

163
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,801
Hmm.

164
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,325
But I don't think he's lost interest.

165
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,528
What makes you say so?

166
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,685
His shipboard inventory.

167
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,527
You can read.
Rare for a woman in your profession.

168
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,648
- Former profession.
- Of course.

169
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,162
I'm missing something obvious
you're about to point out?

170
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,685
Two featherbeds.

171
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,603
He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.

172
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,086
Who is important enough to Littlefinger

173
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,851
to merit a featherbed, besides Littlefinger?

174
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,082
Could he be bringing one of his girls?

175
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,328
He's not interested in them, my lord.

176
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,164
How do you know?

177
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,527
Because I'm one of his girls.

178
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,968
Prodigies in odd places indeed.

179
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,285
Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered

180
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,171
by her brother, or rather, his dragon.

181
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,846
It ate her while her son watched.

182
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,966
What's left of her is
buried in the crypts right down there.

183
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,883
The ceremony
is traditionally held in the main sanctum,

184
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,043
which seats 700 comfortably.

185
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,600
There appears
to be a good deal of room elsewhere

186
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,365
on the premises for everyone else.

187
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,410
There aren't
more than 700 people of any importance.

188
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,769
No, the rest are there
to look adoringly upon the 700

189
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,765
to remind them how
superior they must be to have the best seats.

190
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,686
Over there, in that urn,
the ashes of Aerion Targaryen.

191
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,762
Aerion Brightflame, they called him.

192
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,929
He thought drinking wildfire
would turn him into a dragon.

193
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,242
He was wrong.

194
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,245
And, of course,
there's the Mad King, killed by my uncle.

195
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,324
Would you like to
see where the last Targaryens are buried?

196
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,449
Are you sure Lady Margaery
doesn't find all this a bit macabre?

197
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,602
No, it's quite all right, Your Grace.

198
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,802
I'd love to see their tombs, really.

199
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,008
It's like taking a walk through history.

200
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,206
The tomb's just up here.

201
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,441
This is so exciting.

202
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,885
You were married here, Your Grace?

203
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,411
Yes.

204
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,244
Must seem like only yesterday.

205
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,169
Hmm. Seems like a lifetime ago.

206
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,288
Your husband was buried here as well?

207
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,523
No, he wanted his remains
returned to Storm's End.

208
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,726
Such a tragedy.

209
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,127
A fairly predictable tragedy.

210
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,725
Hunting and drinking don't mix.

211
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,370
I should say not.

212
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,886
My son's a hunter. It helps him forget

213
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,401
he's never been within a mile of a real battle.

214
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,849
I seem to recall he laid siege to Storm's End
for the better part of a year.

215
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,970
All he laid siege to
was the banquet table in the command tent.

216
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,766
I told him to stay out of Robert's Rebellion.

217
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,645
He had no business fighting an actual warrior.

218
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,567
We mothers do what
we can to keep our sons from the grave.

219
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,608
But they do seem to yearn for it.

220
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,570
We shower them with good sense,

221
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,644
and it slides right off, like rain off a wing.

222
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,161
And yet the world belongs to them.

223
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,170
A ridiculous arrangement, to my mind.

224
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,602
The Gods have seen fit to make it so.

225
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,364
My father didn't want them here.

226
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,485
He was going to have their bodies burned
and thrown in the Blackwater,

227
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,325
but the High Septon
convinced him otherwise.

228
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,845
I'm glad he did.

229
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,285
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

230
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,125
I know they did terrible things at the end,

231
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,971
but their ancestors built this.

232
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,966
Sometimes severity
is the price we pay for greatness.

233
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,409
I couldn't agree more.

234
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,441
Shall we go and see them?

235
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:29,285
If you give them your love,
they will return it a thousand fold.

236
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,167
I've spoken with them.
I know how they feel about you.

237
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,610
You led the defense of King's Landing.

238
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,322
They adore you.

239
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,441
Open the doors.

240
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,721
Joffrey.

241
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,125
Wait.

242
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,163
Lady Margaery!
Lady Margaery!

243
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,005
Bless you, Lady Margaery!

244
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,286
Lady Margaery!

245
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,601
Lady Margaery!

246
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,045
Margaery!

247
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,571
Long live Lady Margaery!

248
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,687
King Joffrey!

249
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,921
King Joffrey!

250
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,690
King Joffrey!

251
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,330
King Joffrey!

252
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,448
King Joffrey!

253
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,648
Gods bless King Joffrey!

254
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,324
How far is it to Deepwood Motte?

255
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,124
Not far, my lord.

256
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,043
Your sister is waiting for you there.

257
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,043
- She sent you to save me?
- Yes.

258
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,726
I served them,
the men who were torturing you.

259
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,480
I did what they told and waited.

260
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,881
Why would you risk your life for me?

261
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,964
I grew up on Saltcliffe, my lord.

262
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,129
I was only a boy when they took you away.

263
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,964
My father brought us up to the bluffs

264
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,889
so we could watch you carried off.

265
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,244
I remember the look
on my father's face when he told us,

266
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,051
"That's Balon Greyjoy's last living son."

267
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,607
And those are the words I heard over again

268
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,007
when I saw what they were doing to you.

269
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,927
Those men, they said my father
knew what they were doing to me.

270
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,007
Did he?

271
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:28,326
I don't know, my lord.
They... They never told me much.

272
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,364
My sister's men are loyal to her.

273
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,244
We don't need to hide from them.

274
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,561
Not all those are your sister's men.

275
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,921
Some of them are loyal to your father.

276
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,206
Hmm.

277
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,361
What is it?

278
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,283
I was just thinking how jealous I was

279
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,249
when my father told Yara to take this place.

280
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,288
What did he tell you to do?

281
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,363
Raid fishing villages.

282
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,684
He didn't trust me. Thought I was a Stark.

283
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,922
I could never be a Stark.

284
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,367
Robb Stark always reminded me of that.

285
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,601
He lorded it over you?

286
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,846
Didn't have to.

287
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,003
All he had to do was be.

288
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,204
Be who he was born to be.

289
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,721
His life fit him better than his clothes.

290
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,326
How could someone like that
ever be a brother to me?

291
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,528
He's the King in the North.

292
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,840
And me...

293
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,845
My father gave me a choice and I made it.

294
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,804
I could never be a Stark.

295
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,401
But ironborn, that's what I was born to be.

296
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,320
I paid the iron price for Winterfell.

297
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,930
I murdered those boys.

298
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,810
The Stark boys?

299
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,045
Never found them.

300
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,605
Just some poor orphans living with a farmer.

301
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,806
I let Dagmer slit
their throats and I let him burn the bodies,

302
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,531
so I could keep Winterfell

303
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,047
and make my father proud.

304
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,481
Maybe it's not too late.

305
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,051
It is.

306
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,722
My real father lost his head at King's Landing.

307
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,769
I made a choice,

308
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,367
and I chose wrong.

309
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,526
And now I've burned everything down.

310
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,607
Not everything, my lord.

311
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,766
She's up here.

312
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,609
- Yara.
- Shh!

313
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,290
Wait.

314
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,168
I brought him back. He... He killed the others.

315
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,282
What? No, I didn't.

316
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,570
You can't!

317
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,165
No! Please, stop!

318
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,771
No!

319
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,244
Put him back where he belongs.

320
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,121
Eat.

321
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,690
What are you doing?

322
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,364
I'm dying.

323
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,602
You can't die.

324
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,447
You need to live to take revenge.

325
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,761
I don't care about revenge.

326
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,683
You coward.

327
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,646
A little misfortune and you're giving up.

328
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,925
Misfor...

329
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,171
Misfortune?

330
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,646
You lost your hand.

331
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,485
My sword hand. I was that hand.

332
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,127
You have a taste,

333
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,931
one taste of the real world

334
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,810
where people have
important things taken from them,

335
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,724
and you whine and cry and quit.

336
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,209
You sound like a bloody woman.

337
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,124
I know what you did for me.

338
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,524
You told them Tarth was full of sapphires.

339
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,691
It's called the Sapphire Isle
because of the blue of its water.

340
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,802
You knew that.

341
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,242
Why did you help me?

342
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,204
You wanted to speak to me?

343
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,442
Yes, about Jaime.

344
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,210
What about him?

345
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,089
I wanted to make sure we're doing

346
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,009
everything we can to get him back.

347
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,330
When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner,

348
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,246
what did I do in response?

349
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,725
You started a war.

350
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,010
And if I would start
a war for that lecherous little stump,

351
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,289
what do you think I am doing
for my oldest son and heir?

352
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,646
Whatever you can.

353
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,929
Whatever I can.

354
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,205
You're still here.

355
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,645
Yes.

356
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,085
Why?

357
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,686
Did it ever occur to you that

358
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,171
I might be the one who deserves

359
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,765
your confidence and your trust,

360
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,205
not your sons?

361
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,090
Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me.

362
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,370
Years and years of lectures
on family and legacy...

363
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,321
The same lecture, really,
just with tiny, tedious variations.

364
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,004
Did it ever occur to you that your daughter

365
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,721
might be the only one
listening to them, living by them?

366
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,407
That she might have the most
to contribute to your legacy

367
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,290
that you love so much more
than your actual children?

368
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,165
All right. Contribute.

369
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,047
The Tyrells are a problem.

370
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,610
The Tyrells helped us
defeat Stannis Baratheon.

371
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,923
The Tyrells saved your life,
your children's lives.

372
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,046
Margaery has her claws in Joffrey.

373
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,722
She knows how to manipulate him.

374
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,247
Good. I wish you knew
how to manipulate him.

375
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,481
I don't distrust you because you're a woman.

376
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,167
I distrust you because
you're not as smart as you think you are.

377
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,720
You've allowed that boy to ride roughshod

378
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,446
over you and everyone else in this city.

379
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:48,325
Perhaps you should try
stopping him from doing what he likes.

380
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,250
I will.

381
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,322
Do you like it, Nana?

382
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,210
Another golden rose. How original.

383
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,487
I eat from plates stamped with roses.

384
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,841
I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses.

385
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,730
I have a golden rose
painted on my chamber pot,

386
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,007
as if that makes it smell any better.

387
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,844
Roses are boring, dear.

388
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,361
"Growing strong."

389
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,603
Ha! The dullest words of any house.

390
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,605
"Winter is coming!" Now that's memorable.

391
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,724
"We do not sow." Strong. Strong.

392
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,723
Those are houses you watch out for.

393
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,885
Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts.

394
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,566
But a golden rose growing strong,

395
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,251
that strikes fear in the heart.

396
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,723
Look, little loves.

397
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,643
A spider in the garden.

398
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,441
Run along now. Grow strong.

399
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,170
My lady.

400
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,528
I wanted to personally
welcome you to King's Landing.

401
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,046
The city has
been made brighter by your presence.

402
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,090
The city is made brighter by my presence?

403
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,131
Is that your usual line,
Lord Varys? Are you here to seduce me?

404
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,770
A little obvious, perhaps.

405
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:12,165
Oh, no, please.
Seduce away. It's been so long.

406
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,641
Though I rather think it's all for naught.

407
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,088
What happens when
the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit?

408
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,568
A question for the philosophers.

409
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,610
But you've come mincing
all this way for something.

410
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,682
- So?
- Might I sit?

411
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,841
No.

412
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,565
Come, I've heard you're such a clever man.

413
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,524
I'm curious why you've sought me out.

414
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,326
You've taken an interest in Sansa Stark.

415
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,449
Have I?
Because I spoke to her once in this garden

416
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,444
and one of your little spies
came running to tell you?

417
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,966
Why shouldn't I? She's an interesting girl.

418
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,201
Is she?

419
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,600
No, not particularly.

420
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,569
But she's had an interesting childhood.

421
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,643
She has, sadly.

422
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,682
Well, forgive me for wasting your time, then.

423
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,843
I thought we shared
certain hopes for her well-being.

424
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,925
Come, come.
You surrender rather easily.

425
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,891
Walk with me.

426
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,124
I know the walls have ears,
but apparently the shrubbery does, too.

427
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,003
I choose my allies
carefully, and my enemies more carefully still.

428
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,003
Which is Sansa Stark?

429
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,651
Neither. A babe in the woods.

430
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,721
I admired her father.

431
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,881
Yes.

432
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,008
Ned Stark had many admirers,

433
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,051
and how many stepped forward
when the executioner came for his head?

434
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,442
I could not help Lord Stark.
Perhaps I can help his daughter.

435
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,005
How?

436
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,562
You're not the only one
who has taken an interest in her.

437
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,770
That's hardly surprising.
She's a beautiful girl with a famous name.

438
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,242
Indeed.
She'd make a lovely match for the right suitor.

439
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,210
It almost feels
as if you're about to arrive at the point.

440
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,851
Littlefinger is not long for the capital.

441
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,002
A confidant of mine has told me that

442
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,288
when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him.

443
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,121
And why have you come
to me with this matter?

444
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,046
Littlefinger was born
with no lands, no wealth, no armies.

445
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,522
He has acquired the
first two. How long before he has the army?

446
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,688
Perhaps you'll laugh,
but I know him better than most,

447
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,047
and this is the truth.

448
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,569
Littlefinger is one of
the most dangerous men in Westeros.

449
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:22,282
If Robb Stark falls,
Sansa Stark is the key to the North.

450
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,370
And if he marries her,
he'll have the key in his pocket.

451
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,044
Which seems such a shame.

452
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,168
Why should a man with such a low reputation

453
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,402
steal away such a lovely bride?

454
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,644
You must despise him.
You're working so hard to undermine him.

455
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,610
Actually, I rather enjoy him.

456
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,603
But he would see this country burn

457
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,643
if he could be king of the ashes.

458
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,203
You are a clever man, Lord Varys.

459
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:49,808
You are too kind.
I believe I have a possible solution.

460
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,009
One doesn't need to
be clever for that. It's obvious, isn't it?

461
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,966
I didn't mean to disturb you.

462
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,445
You haven't.

463
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,044
We'd like some privacy, please.

464
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,044
If you wouldn't mind
waiting back inside the keep.

465
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,649
Or if you'd be kind enough
to give me your names,

466
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,451
I'll ask the King to speak with you himself.

467
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,284
What did you pray for?

468
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,646
I can't tell you.

469
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,086
Why not?

470
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,731
I'll tell you
what I prayed for in the Sept this morning.

471
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,600
Let's see,
for my family's health and happiness,

472
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,763
for an end to the war, for a short winter.

473
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,367
Boring and traditional, I'm afraid. And you?

474
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,290
I'm sorry, I just can't.

475
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,530
My cousin Alanna
was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen.

476
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,762
When I was 12, I was all elbows and knees,

477
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,207
and Alanna
looked like a goddess sent to torture me.

478
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,044
"Pig Face," she called me.

479
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,969
"Pig Face"? That's ridiculous.

480
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,162
It had something to do with my nose.

481
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,210
Whenever she passed me
in the halls, she'd oink.

482
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,530
So I prayed that
she'd catch a horrible skin disease.

483
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,126
A week after that,
she came down with porridge plague.

484
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,281
Porridge plague?

485
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,481
Oh, you don't have it in the North?

486
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,006
Your skin starts to look like boiled oats,

487
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,890
and eventually,
your face slides off and you die in agony.

488
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,769
But that's awful.

489
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,530
You're...

490
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,682
I believed you!

491
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,364
Porridge plague. I'm an idiot.

492
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,966
Don't say that. No, you're not.

493
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,361
So what happened to Alanna?

494
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,363
Oh, she grew up to be
the most beautiful woman

495
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,444
and married a handsome
lord and they have darling children

496
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,204
and live in a castle by the sea.

497
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,009
It's all terribly frustrating.

498
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,645
I'm sure she's jealous of you now.

499
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,961
You'll be married here in the capital,

500
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,804
and she'll have to come watch and

501
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,604
pretend to be happy that you're queen.

502
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,922
I want us to be friends, good friends.

503
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,290
That would make me very happy.

504
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,045
You must see Highgarden.
You'd love it there. I know you would.

505
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,044
We have a great
masquerade the night of the harvest moon.

506
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,964
You should see the
costumes. People work on them for months.

507
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,163
Uh, I don't think
the Queen would let me leave King's Landing.

508
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:23,290
The Queen Regent, you mean.
Once I marry Joffrey, I'll be queen.

509
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,405
And if you were to marry Loras,

510
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,567
your place would
be at Highgarden, wouldn't it?

511
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,885
We would be sisters,
you and I. Would you like that?

512
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,845
His name was Bannen.

513
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,288
He was a good man, a good ranger.

514
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,362
He came to us from...

515
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,088
Where did he come from?

516
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,889
Down White Harbor way.

517
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,088
He came to us from White Harbor.

518
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,130
Never failed in his duty.

519
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,283
He kept his vows the best he could.

520
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,887
He rode far, fought fiercely.

521
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,806
We shall never see his like again.

522
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,884
And now his watch has ended.

523
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,881
And now his watch has ended.

524
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,483
Didn't think a broke foot could kill a man.

525
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,484
It wasn't his foot that killed him.

526
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,131
That bastard Craster starved him to death.

527
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,725
Craster's got his daughters to feed.

528
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,484
You on his side?

529
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,882
We can't just show up and steal all his food.

530
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,167
We're brothers of
the Night's Watch, not thieves.

531
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:01,883
The day we leave,
Craster will tap a barrel of our wine,

532
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,009
and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes

533
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,203
and laugh at us starving in the snow.

534
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,809
He's a bloody wildling.

535
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,809
Never knew Bannen could smell so good.

536
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,728
You have one son, don't you, Mormont?

537
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,721
I had my 99th.

538
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,930
You ever meet a man with 99 sons?

539
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,242
And more daughters than I can count.

540
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,446
I'm glad for you.

541
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,681
Are you now?

542
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,287
Me, I'll be glad when
you and yours have gone.

543
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,442
As soon as our wounded are strong enough.

544
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,521
Ah!

545
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,483
They're as strong as they're gonna get.

546
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,249
Them that's dying, why don't you

547
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,044
cut their throats and be done with it?

548
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,842
Or leave them if you've not the
stomach, and I'll sort them myself.

549
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,011
Whose throat you gonna cut, old man?

550
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,925
Wait outside.

551
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,163
It's cold outside and there's nothing to eat.

552
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,844
My wives gave you bread.

553
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,490
There's sawdust in the bread.

554
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,920
You don't like it,
you go out there and eat the snow.

555
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,607
I'd rather eat what you've got hidden away.

556
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,889
I told you to wait outside.

557
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,362
He's sitting there
drinking our wine, eating his fill while we die.

558
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,204
I gave you crows enough.

559
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,361
I've got to feed my women!

560
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,090
You admit you've got a hidden larder?

561
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,884
How else you make it through winter?

562
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,807
- Enough! Out!
- I am a godly man.

563
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,211
You're a stingy bastard!

564
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,771
Bastard?

565
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,287
Out with you, you little thief.

566
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,330
And you! And you!

567
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,801
Go sleep in the cold on empty bellies.

568
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,325
I'll chop the hands off
the next man who calls me bastard.

569
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,045
You are a bastard.

570
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,288
A daughter-fucking, wildling bastard.

571
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,202
The Gods will curse us for this.

572
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,805
By all the laws...

573
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,490
There are no laws beyond the Wall.

574
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,404
Show us where he hides the food,
or you'll get the same as him.

575
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,845
Unhand her.

576
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,449
I shall have your head for this.

577
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,161
Quickly. Quickly.

578
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,401
What's happening?

579
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,130
I'm not going out there.

580
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,890
No, we have to go. Now!

581
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,527
Follow me. I know the best way.

582
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,289
Come on.

583
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,250
Run fast, Piggy, and sleep well!

584
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,091
I'll be cutting your throat one of these nights.

585
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,010
Can I take this hood off yet?

586
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,406
I do apologize, little lady,

587
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,484
but it's better for you
if you don't see where we're going.

588
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,371
Halt!

589
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,961
- What is it?
- Blackstrap rum.

590
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,481
Ugh!

591
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,961
Not easy finding molasses in wartime.

592
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,724
I'd have some.

593
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,447
Let's go home.

594
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,570
What is this place?

595
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,610
Somewhere neither wolves
nor lions come prowling.

596
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,525
You look like a bunch of swineherds.

597
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,602
Some of us were swineherds.

598
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:48,651
And some of us
tanners and masons. That was before.

599
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,681
You're still swineherds
and tanners and masons.

600
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,604
You think carrying a crooked
spear makes you a soldier?

601
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,681
No.

602
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,203
Fighting in a war makes you a soldier.

603
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,362
Beric Dondarrion?

604
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,283
You've seen better days.

605
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,283
And I won't see them again.

606
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:15,608
Stark deserters. Baratheon deserters.

607
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,690
You lot aren't
fighting in a war, you're running from it.

608
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,001
Last I heard,
you were King Joffrey's guard dog.

609
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:26,723
But here you are 1,000 miles from
home. Which of us is running?

610
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,848
Untie these ropes and we'll find out.

611
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,527
What are you doing
leading a mob of peasants?

612
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,685
Ned Stark ordered me to execute your
brother in King Robert's name.

613
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,161
Ned Stark is dead.

614
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,447
King Robert is dead.

615
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,602
My brother's alive.

616
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,884
You're fighting for ghosts.

617
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,086
That's what we are,
ghosts waiting for you in the dark.

618
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,085
You can't see us, but we see you.

619
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:03,200
No matter whose cloak
you wear, Lannister, Stark, Baratheon,

620
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,203
you prey on the weak,

621
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,931
the Brotherhood
Without Banners will hunt you down.

622
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,082
You found god? Is that it?

623
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,650
Aye.

624
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,485
I've been reborn
in the light of the one true god.

625
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,170
As have we all.

626
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,851
As would any man
who's seen the things we've seen.

627
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,526
If you mean to murder me, then get on with it.

628
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,649
You'll die soon enough, dog.

629
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:29,202
But it won't be murder, only justice.

630
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,727
And a kinder fate than you deserve.
Lions, you call yourselves.

631
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,043
At the Mummer's Ford,
girls of seven years were raped,

632
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:40,011
and babes still on the breast
were cut in two while their mothers watched.

633
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,128
I wasn't at the Mummer's Ford.

634
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,726
Dump your dead children at some other door.

635
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,167
House Clegane was built upon dead children.

636
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:51,290
I saw them lay Prince Aegon
and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne.

637
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:55,524
Do you take me for
my brother? Is being born Clegane a crime?

638
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,090
Murder is a crime.

639
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,725
I never touched the Targaryen babes.

640
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,442
I never saw them, never smelled
them, never heard them bawling.

641
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,161
You want to cut my throat, get on with it!

642
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:11,040
But don't call me murderer
and pretend that you're not.

643
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,326
You murdered Mycah.

644
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,608
The butcher's boy. My friend.

645
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:21,481
He was 12 years old.
He was unarmed. And you rode him down.

646
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,040
You slung him
over your horse like he was some deer.

647
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,600
Aye, he was a bleeder.

648
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,450
You don't deny killing this boy?

649
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,090
I was Joffrey's sworn shield.

650
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,049
- The boy attacked the prince.
- That's a lie!

651
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,522
I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away.

652
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,446
Then I should have
killed you. Not my place to question princes.

653
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,962
You stand accused of murder.

654
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,281
But no one here knows the truth

655
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,607
of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you.

656
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,411
Only the Lord of Light may do that now.

657
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,086
I sentence you to trial by combat.

658
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,601
So, who will it be?

659
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:07,049
Should we find out
if your fire god really loves you, priest?

660
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,442
Or you, archer? What are you
worth with a sword in your hand?

661
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,326
Or is the little girl the bravest one here?

662
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,081
Aye.

663
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,884
She might be.

664
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,803
But it's me you'll fight.

665
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,047
The master says they are untested.

666
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,411
He says you would be wise
to blood them early.

667
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,164
There are many small cities between

668
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,044
here and there, cities ripe for sacking.

669
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,208
Should you take captives, the masters will

670
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,322
buy the healthy ones and for a good price.

671
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,129
And who knows?

672
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,361
In 10 years, some of the boys you send them

673
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,761
may be Unsullied in their turn.

674
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,688
Thus, all shall prosper.

675
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,609
Is it done, then? They belong to me?

676
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,167
It is done.

677
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,366
It is done.

678
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,965
She holds the whip.

679
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,850
You hold the whip.

680
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,930
This bitch has her army.

681
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,321
Unsullied!

682
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,880
Forward march!

683
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:07,881
Halt!

684
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,683
Tell the bitch her beast won't come.

685
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,963
A dragon is not a slave.

686
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,921
You speak Valyrian?

687
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,726
I am Daenerys Stormborn
of the House Targaryen,

688
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,328
of the blood of Old Valyria.

689
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,891
Valyrian is my mother tongue.

690
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,001
Unsullied!

691
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,691
Slay the masters,

692
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:47,084
slay the soldiers,
slay every man who holds a whip,

693
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,764
but harm no child.

694
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,081
Strike the chains off every slave you see!

695
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,365
I am your master!

696
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,209
Kill her! Kill her!

697
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,286
Kill her!

698
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,885
Dracarys.

699
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,161
Unsullied!

700
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:39,121
You have been slaves all your life.
Today you are free.

701
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:45,845
Any man who wishes to leave may leave,
and no one will harm him.

702
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,330
I give you my word.

703
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,010
Will you fight for me?
As free men?

1
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,725
Lord,

2
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,968
cast your light upon us.

3
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,042
Lord of Light, defend us.

4
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,044
Show us the truth.

5
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,562
Strike this man down if he is guilty.

6
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,887
Give strength to his sword if he is true.

7
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,882
Lord of Light, give us wisdom,

8
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,970
for the night is dark and full of terrors.

9
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,725
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

10
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,325
Get back.

11
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,126
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

12
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,728
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

13
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,131
- Guilty.
- Kill him!

14
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,406
Lord, cast your
light upon this man, your servant.

15
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,882
Bring him back from
death and darkness. Restore his flame.

16
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,486
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

17
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,722
- Lord, cast...
- Arya, don't!

18
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,247
Bring him back
from death and darkness...

19
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,002
No! Let go of me! Let me go!

20
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,163
Looks like their god
likes me more than your butcher's boy.

21
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,844
Burn in hell!

22
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,129
He will.

23
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,122
But not today.

24
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,208
Orell says there are crows
patrolling on the Wall.

25
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,406
Tell me what you know.

26
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,480
There are four to a patrol,
two builders to check for structural damage,

27
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,164
two rangers to watch for enemies.

28
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,930
How often do these patrols go out?

29
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,049
It varies.

30
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,521
If I knew where on the Wall
we were heading, I could tell you.

31
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,806
You'd like to know that.

32
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,529
There are 19 castles guarding the Wall.

33
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,528
How many are manned?

34
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,005
Three.

35
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,411
You sure of that?

36
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,640
Which three?

37
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,961
Castle Black.

38
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,005
Aye, Castle Black.

39
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,970
Everyone knows Castle Black.

40
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,844
Which others?

41
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,644
Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and the Shadow Tower.

42
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,843
How many men remain in Castle Black?

43
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,490
- A thousand.
- Liar.

44
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,842
What happens to your eagle after I kill you?

45
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,526
Does he drift away
like a kite with his strings cut,

46
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,565
or does he just flop dead to the ground?

47
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,091
He's no crow.

48
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,640
Just 'cause you want him
inside, you don't make him one of us.

49
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,165
I'm not afraid of you.

50
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,369
I like you, boy.

51
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,366
But if you lie to me,
I'll pull your guts out through your throat.

52
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,202
A thousand men.

53
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,887
We'll find out soon enough.

54
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,770
I don't need you to protect me.

55
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,126
Of course you do.

56
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,880
Who stopped Rattleshirt
when he was about to cut your throat?

57
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,689
Who vouched for you with Mance?

58
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,888
It seems you owe me a debt.

59
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,441
Give it back.

60
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,721
Well, I stole it.

61
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,202
It's mine. If you want it, come steal it back.

62
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,004
Ygritte!

63
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,289
Ygritte!

64
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,646
Ygritte! Seven hells.

65
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,530
Ygritte!

66
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,450
Is Orell right? Are you still a crow?

67
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,607
It's time you proved yourself.

68
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,405
Ygritte.

69
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,851
You swore some vows.

70
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,566
I want you to break 'em.

71
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,808
I want you to see me.

72
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,370
All of me.

73
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,091
We shouldn't.

74
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,325
We should.

75
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,290
Why are you still dressed?
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

76
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,051
That thing you did with your mouth...

77
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,480
Is that what lords
do to their ladies in the South?

78
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,403
I don't know.
I just wanted to kiss you there is all.

79
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,527
Hmm.

80
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,567
You seemed to like it.

81
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,961
Aye, I liked it some.

82
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,003
Who taught you that?

83
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,765
There's been no one else. Only you.

84
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,367
A maid. You were a maid.

85
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,242
I was a man of the Night's Watch.

86
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,282
How about you? Were you a maid?

87
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,691
What do you think?

88
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,205
Who was he?

89
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,810
Just a boy.

90
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,326
He came trading with his brothers.

91
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,882
He had red hair like me. Kissed by fire. But...

92
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,611
He was weak. Not like you.

93
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,886
That was the first one.
Then there was this Thenn boy.

94
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,964
Spoke no Common,
but, Gods, he was built like a mammoth...

95
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,089
Yeah, thanks.
I think I've heard enough.

96
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,810
We'd best get back.

97
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,809
Tormund...

98
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,762
I'm not done with you yet.

99
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,921
How long's it been since you had a bath?

100
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,763
Let's not go back.

101
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,601
Let's stay here a while longer.

102
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,644
I don't ever want to leave this cave, Jon Snow.

103
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,363
Not ever.

104
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,560
I want my gold.

105
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,644
It says clearly on that
note, you'll be paid when the war is over.

106
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,007
Piss on that! You're nothing but thieves.

107
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,721
We're outlaws. Outlaws
steal. You're lucky we didn't kill you.

108
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,565
Come try it, archer.
I'll shove those arrows up your ass.

109
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,881
You can't let him go.
He's a murderer. He's guilty.

110
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,485
Not in the eyes of God.

111
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,607
- You can't!
- Enough!

112
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,209
The judgment isn't ours to make.

113
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,843
Go in peace, Sandor Clegane.
The Lord of Light isn't done with you yet.

114
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,246
Riders coming through!

115
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,971
The Kingslayer.

116
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,121
Down!

117
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,850
On your knees.

118
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,489
Lord Bolton, I give you the Kingslayer.

119
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,841
Pick him up, Locke.

120
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,131
You've lost a hand.

121
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,602
No, my lord, he has it here.

122
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,327
Take this away.

123
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,487
Send it to his father?

124
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,564
You'll hold your tongue
unless you want to lose it.

125
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,761
Cut her free.

126
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,521
Apologies, my lady.
You're under my protection now.

127
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,490
Thank you, my lord.

128
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,368
Find suitable rooms for our guests.

129
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,890
We'll speak later.

130
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,041
Lord Bolton.

131
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,964
Is there word from the capital?

132
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,731
You haven't heard?

133
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,442
Stannis Baratheon laid siege
to King's Landing.

134
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,650
Sailed into Blackwater Bay.
Stormed the gates with thousands of men.

135
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,764
And your sister...

136
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,084
How can I put this?

137
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,170
Your sister...

138
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,251
Is alive and well.

139
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,168
Your father's forces prevailed.

140
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,007
Ser Jaime isn't well.

141
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,525
Take him to Qyburn.

142
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,120
Will I die?

143
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,480
No.

144
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,285
The corruption has spread.
I fear it must be cut away.

145
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,043
The safest course
would be to take the whole arm off.

146
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,963
Then you'll die.

147
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,528
You're no maester.

148
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,684
Where's your chain?

149
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,484
The Citadel stripped me of it.

150
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,646
They found some of my experiments too bold.

151
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,202
I can leave your upper arm,
make the cut at your elbow.

152
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,642
I don't need my right hand to kill you.

153
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,766
I can take away the rotting flesh

154
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,049
and try and burn
out the corruption with boiling wine.

155
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,566
Mmm.

156
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,888
With any luck, that will suffice.

157
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,323
You'll need milk of the poppy.

158
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,601
No milk of the poppy.

159
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,846
There will be pain.

160
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,566
I'll scream.

161
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,886
Quite a bit of pain.

162
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,962
I'll scream loudly.

163
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,644
Lord Baelish.

164
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,051
Your Grace.

165
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,690
I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.

166
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,325
Of course, Your Grace.

167
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,961
I believe that House Tyrell don't hold the
crown's best interests at heart.

168
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,682
I see. And have you
shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?

169
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,366
My father's a practical man.
He appreciates facts.

170
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,011
Myself, I often find them a hindrance.

171
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,243
And he appreciates
those who aid his family, as you well know.

172
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,561
He's almost as generous to those who help us

173
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,007
as he is unpleasant towards those who don't.

174
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,481
You have a good
working relationship with the Tyrells.

175
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,564
I thought you might
look into it before you leave the capital.

176
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,569
- I shall do my best.
- Thank you.

177
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,409
And your best will prove better than

178
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,284
when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?

179
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,930
I assure you that it will.

180
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,771
Gods, boy, that's enough.
We're not in a tavern.

181
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,046
- Pardon, my lady.
- No need to speak.

182
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,282
Are there any figs? Fetch some.

183
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,921
I always take figs
midafternoon. They help move the bowels.

184
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,090
To what do I owe this summons?

185
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,162
Thank you for seeing me, my lady.

186
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,368
I had hoped we might discuss
a few financial matters.

187
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,126
I climbed all those steps
to discuss financial matters?

188
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,851
It's the royal wedding.
I'm told you had a hand in planning it.

189
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,524
Naturally.

190
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,682
It's shaping up to be a very involved affair.

191
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,644
The word "extravagant" has been used.

192
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,450
What good is the word "extravagant"

193
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,966
if it can't be used
to describe a royal wedding?

194
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,883
- I understand that.
- Good.

195
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,962
But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me

196
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,048
to calculate the cost for the crown.

197
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,691
As of now, it's a huge expense.

198
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,841
And?

199
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,649
And we're at war, Lady Olenna.

200
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,961
Oh, I'd nearly forgotten.

201
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,530
And maintaining supply lines...

202
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,165
I can't think how it slipped my mind.

203
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,564
What is it, 12,000
infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied?

204
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,089
1,800 mounted lances. 2,000 in support.

205
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,164
Provisions, so this city
might survive the winter.

206
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,651
A million bushels of wheat.

207
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,321
Half a million bushels each
of barley, oats, and rye.

208
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,722
20,000 head of cattle. 50,000 sheep.

209
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,246
You don't have to lecture me
about wartime expenses.

210
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,209
I'm quite familiar with them.

211
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,930
And we are grateful for your contributions,

212
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,606
which are necessary
for the preservation of the realm.

213
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,762
As is a royal wedding.

214
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,286
The people are hungry
for more than just food.

215
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,646
They crave distractions.

216
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,043
And if we don't provide them,
they'll create their own.

217
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,527
And their distractions are likely to

218
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,961
end with us being torn to pieces.

219
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,562
A royal wedding is much
safer. Wouldn't you say?

220
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,365
I would.

221
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,525
And traditionally paid for by the royal family.

222
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,364
I was told you were drunk,
impertinent, and thoroughly debauched.

223
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,522
Imagine my disappointment at finding

224
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,802
nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper.

225
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,489
Where did you go for them, Volantis?

226
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,885
- My lady...
- Oh, very well.

227
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,961
I won't have it said
that House Tyrell refuses to play its part.

228
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,283
We'll pay for half,
and the celebrations will go on as planned.

229
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,328
- Is that sufficient?
- Quite. Thank you.

230
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,448
Very good, then. That's settled. Good day.

231
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,604
Give me that.

232
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,404
What are you doing?

233
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,125
Just mending Lord Beric's armor.

234
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,685
Why?

235
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,088
I'm going to stay and smith
for the Brotherhood.

236
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,090
Have you lost your mind?

237
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,085
When the Lannisters find this place,

238
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,645
you think they'll spare the smiths?

239
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,166
They'll cave your head in.

240
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,971
They wanted to kill me
long before I joined the Brotherhood.

241
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,451
You don't have to.

242
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,329
I want to. They need good men.

243
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,609
Robb needs good men, too.
We're leaving tomorrow.

244
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,727
And then you...

245
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,887
What? Serve him?

246
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,601
I've served men my entire life.

247
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,120
I served Master Mott at King's Landing,
and he sold me to the Watch.

248
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,005
I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal,

249
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,448
wondering every day
if I'd get tortured or killed.

250
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,809
- I'm done serving.
- You just said you were serving Lord Beric.

251
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,129
He may be their leader, but they chose him.

252
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,805
These men are brothers. They're a family.

253
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,484
I've never had a family.

254
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,084
I can be your family.

255
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,600
You wouldn't be my family.
You'd be "my lady."

256
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,330
Willem.

257
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,321
Willem!

258
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,250
Is this a rescue?

259
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,970
Lannister filth! Take him!

260
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,121
Please, I didn't do anything.

261
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,565
I'm just a squire. Please...

262
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,361
Bring them in.

263
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,286
Is that all of them?

264
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,687
It took five of you
to murder two unarmed squires?

265
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,162
Not murder, Your Grace. Vengeance.

266
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,725
Vengeance?

267
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,651
Those boys didn't kill your sons.

268
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,326
I saw Harrion die
on the battlefield, and Torrhen...

269
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,482
Was strangled by the Kingslayer.

270
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,483
- They were his kin.
- They were boys!

271
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,411
Look at them.

272
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,686
Tell your mother to look at them.

273
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,368
She killed them as much as I.

274
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,843
My mother had nothing to do with
this. This was your treason.

275
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,763
It's treason to free your enemies.

276
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,249
In war, you kill your enemies.

277
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,845
Did your father not teach you that, boy?

278
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,608
Leave him.

279
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,445
Aye.

280
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,965
Leave me to the King.

281
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,442
He wants to give me
a scolding before he sets me free.

282
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:37,444
That's how he
deals with treason. Our King in the North.

283
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,006
Or should I call him

284
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,771
the King Who Lost the North?

285
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,931
Escort Lord Karstark
to the dungeon. Hang the rest.

286
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,890
Mercy! I didn't kill
anyone. I only watched for the guards.

287
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,007
This one was only the watcher.

288
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,362
Hang him last, so he can watch the others die.

289
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:03,761
Please! Please, no. They made me do it!
They made me! They made me!

290
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,086
Word of this can't leave Riverrun.

291
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,844
They were Tywin Lannister's nephews.

292
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,724
The Lannisters pay their debts.

293
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,290
They never stop talking about it.

294
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,811
Would you make me a liar as well?

295
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,804
It wouldn't be lying.

296
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,242
We will bury them
and remain silent until the war is done.

297
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,651
I'm not fighting for justice

298
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,650
if I don't serve justice
to murderers in my ranks,

299
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,724
no matter how highborn.

300
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,170
He has to die.

301
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:41,161
The Karstarks are Northmen.
They won't forgive the killing of their lord.

302
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:46,007
Your mother's right. If you do this,
the Karstarks will abandon you.

303
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,003
You tended to their wounds.

304
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,000
You brought them supper. Now they're dead.

305
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,368
And more boys will keep dying
until this war is over.

306
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,204
You need Karstark men to end it.

307
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,521
Spare his life. Keep him as a hostage.

308
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,726
A hostage.

309
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,762
Tell the Karstarks that as long as they're
loyal, he will not be harmed.

310
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,561
The blood of the First Men flows through

311
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,121
my veins as much as yours, boy.

312
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,046
I fought the Mad King for your father.

313
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,802
I fought Joffrey for you.

314
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,610
We are kin, Stark and Karstark.

315
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,651
That didn't stop you
from betraying me, and it won't save you now.

316
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:58,927
I don't want it to save me.
I want it to haunt you to the end of your days.

317
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,163
Kneel, my lord.

318
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,130
Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold,

319
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,483
here, in sight of gods and
men, I sentence you to die.

320
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,168
Would you speak a final word?

321
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,770
Kill me and be cursed.
You are no king of mine.

322
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,124
Joffrey.

323
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,849
Cersei.

324
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,649
Ilyn Payne.

325
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,129
Ser Meryn.

326
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,204
The Hound.

327
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,690
What are you going to do with me?

328
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,244
At first light we'll ride for
Riverrun. Your brother's there now.

329
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,441
He'll make a contribution to our
cause, and you can go home.

330
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,326
I'm a hostage and you're selling me.

331
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,845
Don't think of it that way.

332
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,160
But it is that way.

333
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,486
It is.

334
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,887
And it isn't.

335
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,126
More is than isn't.

336
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,649
Beric admired your father
a great deal, you know.

337
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,643
He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether.

338
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,245
So, why don't you?

339
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,970
We need the gold.

340
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,890
Do I frighten you, child?

341
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,531
No.

342
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,127
You're angry with me, and I don't blame you,

343
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,527
but letting him go was the right thing.

344
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,122
I have more reason to want him hanged.

345
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,326
I thought he killed you.

346
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,646
He did.

347
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,370
But how...

348
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,645
Thoros, how many times
have you brought me back?

349
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,891
It's the Lord of Light who brings you back.

350
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,731
I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words.

351
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,926
How many times?

352
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,201
Five, I think.

353
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,765
No, this makes six.

354
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,647
Six.

355
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,882
There was the first time. The Mountain.

356
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,167
Show her.

357
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,769
Lance right through the chest.

358
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,521
Then I was stabbed in the belly.

359
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,284
Then it was an arrow in the back.

360
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,681
And that ax in the side.

361
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,082
Then the Lannisters caught me
and executed me for treason.

362
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,763
Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?

363
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,969
Both. Fuckers couldn't decide.

364
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,245
And the Hound makes six.

365
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,849
Second time I've been killed by a Clegane.

366
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,763
You'd think you'd learn.

367
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,086
It's not getting any easier, you know.

368
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,050
I know.

369
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,203
Every time I come back,

370
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,166
I'm a bit less.

371
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,162
Pieces of you get chipped away.

372
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,924
Could you bring back a man without a head?

373
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,769
Not six times. Just once.

374
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,609
I don't think it works that way, child.

375
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:31,649
He was a good man, Ned Stark.
He's at rest now, somewhere.

376
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,640
I would never wish my life upon him.

377
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,530
I would.

378
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,130
You're alive.

379
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,490
Lord, cast your light upon me.

380
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,130
Protect me in the darkness.

381
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,246
Burn away my sins.

382
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,051
Help me serve you.

383
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,927
Use me as you will.

384
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,803
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

385
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,091
I have prayed day and night
for you to come to me.

386
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,963
My lady.

387
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,883
I meant to come sooner.

388
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,531
The battle...

389
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,125
I know of your troubles, my King.

390
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,771
The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.

391
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,085
Yes, of course.

392
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,408
You mustn't despair.
Your claim is true. You will be victorious.

393
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,646
I believed that once.

394
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,490
You are the One God's
champion and the finest man I've ever known.

395
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,641
Selyse.

396
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,363
I've broken a sacred vow.

397
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,561
I've sinned.

398
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,205
No.

399
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,685
I've wronged you.

400
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,241
I have shamed you.

401
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,284
You're doing God's work.

402
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,725
You don't understand.

403
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,288
The Red Woman...

404
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,607
The Lady Melisandre...

405
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,920
I know, Stannis.

406
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,080
The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.

407
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,284
No act done in service
of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin.

408
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,081
When she told me,

409
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,251
I wept with you.

410
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,647
Oh, my sweet boys.

411
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,650
Petyr, Tommard, Edric.

412
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:20,248
I thank God every day
for bringing Melisandre to us.

413
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,881
She gave you a son.

414
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,402
I gave you

415
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,369
- Nothing.
- That's not true.

416
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,166
So, you've come to see her as well?

417
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,523
There is no need.

418
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,407
You must keep away from such distractions.

419
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,966
She's my daughter.

420
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,561
I want to see her.

421
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,645
You are a king.
You don't need my permission.

422
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,848
The sea
I know, I know

423
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,522
Oh, oh, oh

424
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,846
The birds have scales

425
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,045
And the fish take wing

426
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,926
I know, I know

427
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,040
Oh, oh, oh

428
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,965
Shireen.

429
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,530
Father!

430
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,040
You've grown since I last saw you.

431
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,724
Mother said you fought in a battle.

432
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,721
Did you win?

433
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,571
No.

434
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,449
Did the Onion Knight come back with you?

435
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,727
He did. He fought bravely.

436
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,564
He hasn't come to visit me.

437
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,685
He said he'd bring
me back a present from the capital.

438
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,330
He won't be visiting, child.

439
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,801
Why not? He's my friend.

440
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,405
Look.

441
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,650
He made this for me.

442
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,443
But don't tell Mother I have it. It's a secret.

443
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,561
Mother doesn't like the Onion Knight.

444
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,731
Ser Davos is a traitor.

445
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,249
He's rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime.

446
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,762
Best forget him.

447
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,490
Not so hard. You'll scrub the skin off.

448
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,800
What are you doing here?

449
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,166
I need a bath.

450
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,648
Help me out of these rags.

451
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,761
Now get out.

452
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,321
There's another tub.

453
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,323
This one suits me fine.

454
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,886
Don't worry. I'm not interested.

455
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,721
If I faint, pull me out.

456
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,289
I don't intend to be
the first Lannister to die in a bathtub.

457
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,090
Why should I care how you die?

458
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,891
You swore a solemn vow, remember?

459
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,922
You're supposed to
get me to King's Landing in one piece.

460
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,165
Not going so well, is it?

461
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,810
No wonder Renly died,
with you guarding him.

462
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,367
That was unworthy. Forgive me.

463
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,922
- You protected me better than most...
- Don't you mock me.

464
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,843
I'm apologizing.

465
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,009
I'm sick of fighting. Let's call a truce.

466
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,889
You need trust to have a truce.

467
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,808
I trust you.

468
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,644
There it is. There's the look.

469
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,722
I've seen it for 17 years, on face after face.

470
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,802
You all despise me.

471
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,761
Kingslayer. Oathbreaker.

472
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,563
A man without honor.

473
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,086
You've heard of wildfire?

474
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,571
Of course.

475
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,325
The Mad King was obsessed with it.

476
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,529
He loved to watch people burn,

477
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:18,208
the way their skin blackened and
blistered and melted off their bones.

478
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,368
He burned lords he didn't like.

479
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,528
He burned Hands who disobeyed him.

480
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,683
He burned anyone who was against him.

481
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,685
Before long, half the country was against him.

482
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,161
Aerys saw traitors everywhere,

483
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,324
so he had his pyromancer
place caches of wildfire all over the city,

484
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,287
beneath the Sept of Baelor
and the slums of Flea Bottom.

485
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,648
Under houses, stables, taverns.

486
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,281
Even beneath the Red Keep itself.

487
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,125
Finally, the day of reckoning came.

488
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,727
Robert Baratheon marched on the capital

489
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,047
after his victory at the Trident.

490
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:12,291
But my father arrived first,
with the whole Lannister army at his back,

491
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:16,160
promising to defend the city
against the rebels.

492
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,841
I knew my father better than that.

493
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,167
He's never been one to pick the losing side.

494
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,322
I told the Mad King as much.

495
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,321
I urged him to surrender peacefully.

496
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,848
But the King didn't listen to me.

497
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,207
He didn't listen to Varys,
who tried to warn him.

498
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,330
But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle,

499
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,082
that gray, sunken cunt.

500
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,366
"You can trust the Lannisters," he said.

501
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,684
"The Lannisters
have always been true friends of the crown."

502
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,927
So, we opened the gates,
and my father sacked the city.

503
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:07,562
Once again,
I came to the King, begging him to surrender.

504
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:16,287
He told me to bring him my father's head.

505
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,566
Then he turned to his pyromancer.

506
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,646
"Burn them all," he said.

507
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:31,527
"Burn them in their homes.
Burn them in their beds."

508
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,808
Tell me, if your precious Renly

509
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,770
commanded you to kill your own father

510
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,281
and stand by while thousands of men,

511
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,846
women, and children burned alive,

512
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,570
would you have done it?

513
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,445
Would you have kept your oath then?

514
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,803
First, I killed the pyromancer.

515
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,245
And then, when the King turned to flee,

516
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,765
I drove my sword into his back.

517
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,445
"Burn them all,"
he kept saying. "Burn them all."

518
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,368
I don't think he expected to die.

519
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,684
He meant to burn with the rest of us

520
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,206
and rise again,

521
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,841
reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash.

522
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,328
I slit his throat to
make sure that didn't happen.

523
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,484
That's where Ned Stark found me.

524
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,366
If this is true...

525
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,809
Why didn't you tell anyone?

526
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,769
Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?

527
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,921
Stark?

528
00:39:53,360 --> 00:40:00,084
You think the honorable Ned Stark

529
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,322
wanted to hear my side?

530
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:08,440
He judged me guilty
the moment he set eyes on me.

531
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:17,127
By what right does the wolf judge the lion?

532
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,324
- By what right?
- Help! Help!

533
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,323
The Kingslayer!

534
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,161
Jaime. My name is Jaime.

535
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,965
Onion Knight. Ser Onion Knight.

536
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,451
Princess? Gods, what are you doing here?

537
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,681
Shh! You'll wake Bert.

538
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,006
Ben?

539
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,641
He's the fat one. He's on guard duty tonight.

540
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,161
He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.

541
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,891
Go back to your room.
You're not supposed to be here.

542
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,803
- If your father knew...
- He said you were a traitor.

543
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,846
Are you?

544
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,726
I am, child.

545
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,443
I disobeyed my king,
your father, and now I'm paying the price.

546
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,089
I don't care. You're my friend.

547
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,967
You must get bored
down here. I brought you something to read.

548
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,727
It's about Aegon and his dragons.

549
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,002
Aegon used to live here. Did you know that?

550
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,969
- And the Targaryens built this castle.
- Aye.

551
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,246
So they did.

552
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,521
You can hide the book under your cloak.

553
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,888
It's a good one. I'll bring you more.

554
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,804
Thank you, my lady. I'm sure it's a fine book,

555
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,803
- But it's wasted on me.
- Take it.

556
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,570
I have more.

557
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,570
My lady, I can't read the words.

558
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,244
You can't?

559
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,047
I'll teach you.
I'll come when Bert's on duty and teach you.

560
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,122
- No. No. No.
- It's easy. It'll be fun.

561
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,690
Go. We can't.

562
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,003
Why not? What will they do, lock us in cells?

563
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,768
- I wouldn't know where to start.
- At the beginning.

564
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,770
This word is "Aegon."

565
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:56,209
When you see
and "G" together like that,

566
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,089
it sounds like "egg."

567
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,770
And the title of the whole book

568
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:04,289
is An History of Aegon the
Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros.

569
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,443
It was a bitch of a siege.
Mmm.

570
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,363
You were first through the breach at Pyke?

571
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,441
The second.

572
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,965
Thoros of Myr went in
alone, waving that flaming sword of his.

573
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,771
Thoros of Myr. Bloody madman.

574
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,889
Robert knighted you after the battle?

575
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,689
Proudest moment of my life.

576
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,684
One knee in the dust,
the King's sword on my shoulder,

577
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,727
listening to the words,

578
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,407
"In the name of the Warrior,
I charge you to be brave."

579
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,720
All I could think of
was how badly I had to piss.

580
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,811
In full plate metal for 16 hours.

581
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,729
Never occurred to me
till the fighting was over.

582
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,529
I was very nearly the first man

583
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,404
knighted to piss on the King's boots.

584
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,166
Robert would have laughed.

585
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,522
He was a good man, a great warrior.

586
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,290
And a terrible king.

587
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,763
I burned away my years
fighting for terrible kings.

588
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,524
- You swore an oath.
- Yes.

589
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,080
And a man of honor keeps his vows,

590
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,726
even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic.

591
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,804
Just once in my life before it's over,

592
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,770
I want to know
what it's like to serve with pride,

593
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,968
to fight for someone I believe in.

594
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,410
Do you believe in her?

595
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,010
With all my heart.

596
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,561
These are the ones?

597
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,722
Yes, Khaleesi. The officers.

598
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,922
You did not choose this life.

599
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,725
But you are free men now.
And free men make their own choices.

600
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,122
Have you selected your own leader
from amongst your ranks?

601
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,481
Remove your helmet.

602
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,965
This one has the honor.

603
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,889
What is your name?

604
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,405
Grey Worm.

605
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,720
Grey Worm.

606
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,129
All Unsullied boys
are given new names when they are cut.

607
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,445
Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat.

608
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,285
Names that remind them what they are...

609
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,690
Vermin.

610
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,924
From this day forward,
you will choose your own names.

611
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,403
You will tell your fellow soldiers
to do the same.

612
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,923
Throw away your slave name.

613
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,726
Choose the name your parents gave you,
or any other.

614
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,361
A name that gives you pride.

615
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,488
"Grey Worm" gives me pride.
It is a lucky name.

616
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,290
The name this one was born
with was cursed.

617
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:59,610
That was the name he had when he
was taken as a slave.

618
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,090
But Grey Worm is the name this one had

619
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,404
the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free.

620
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,848
King Robert wanted her dead.

621
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,242
Of course he wanted her
dead. She's a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.

622
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,450
I suppose no one on the Small
Council could speak sense to him.

623
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,760
I didn't sit on the Small Council.

624
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,166
No?

625
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,527
Doesn't the Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard traditionally...

626
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,806
Traditionally, yes,

627
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,690
but I killed a dozen
of Robert's friends during his rebellion.

628
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,729
He didn't want advice on how to govern

629
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,649
from a man who had fought for the Mad King.

630
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,849
Can't say I minded much.

631
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,927
I always hated the politics.

632
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,923
Yeah, I imagine I would, too.

633
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,288
Hours spent jabbering about
backstabbings and betrayals the world over.

634
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,441
Mmm-hmm.

635
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,729
Still, she'll have to wade through that muck

636
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,683
if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms.

637
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,524
She'll have good men around her

638
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,444
to advise her, men with experience.

639
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,682
Which men do you have in mind?

640
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,928
Forgive me for what I'm about to say,

641
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,446
but your reputation
in Westeros has suffered over the years.

642
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,887
It suffered for a reason.
I sold men into slavery.

643
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,044
I don't know if your presence by her side

644
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,929
will help our cause when we go home.

645
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,968
Our cause?

646
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,611
Forgive me, Ser Barristan,
but I was busy defending the Khaleesi

647
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,170
against King Robert's assassins

648
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,805
while you were still bowing to the man.

649
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,964
We both want her to rule. Am I wrong?

650
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,604
You only joined us a few days ago.

651
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,449
I can't speak to your intentions.

652
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,006
If we're truly her loyal servants,

653
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,606
we will do whatever needs to be done,

654
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,200
no matter the cost, no matter our pride.

655
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,081
You're not Lord Commander
here. You're just another exile.

656
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,529
And I take my orders from the Queen.

657
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,081
Come to bed.

658
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,850
You were right.

659
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,405
The Karstarks are gone.

660
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,246
Almost half our forces.

661
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:09,248
Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to
do to make us unravel.

662
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,685
Nothing.

663
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,169
Only wait.

664
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,761
Don't let him.

665
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:20,562
What can I do? Attack King's Landing?

666
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:24,527
There's nothing
he'd like better. He'd crush us in a day.

667
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,081
We could ride north.

668
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,331
Take your land back
from the Greyjoys. Wait out the winter.

669
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,849
Winter could last five years.

670
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,445
Once my bannermen are home again,

671
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,166
sitting by the fire,
surrounded by their families,

672
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,289
warm and safe, they'll never ride south again.

673
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,248
When I gathered my lords
together, we had a purpose, a mission.

674
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,130
Now we're like a band of bickering children.

675
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,448
Give them a new purpose.

676
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,965
What?

677
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:59,281
I don't know.
I don't even know where Winterfell is.

678
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,050
Here.

679
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,045
And we're here.

680
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,641
King's Landing...

681
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,131
What is it?

682
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,883
I can't force them to meet us in the field

683
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,167
and I can't attack them
where they're strongest,

684
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,170
but I can attack them where they're not.

685
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,049
And Casterly Rock can't run away.

686
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,530
I'm going to take their home away from them.

687
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,450
Can you do it?

688
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,889
I need men to
replace the Karstarks who marched home.

689
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,369
There is only one person in this kingdom

690
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:51,649
with that kind of army
who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters.

691
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,681
The man whose daughter
I was supposed to marry.

692
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,605
Walder Frey.

693
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,962
He's such a splendid fighter.

694
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,205
Do you have any idea when we might...

695
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,840
I'll plant the seed
as soon as Joffrey and I are married.

696
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,410
It should grow quickly.

697
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,923
Joffrey won't let me leave.
He's got too many reasons to keep me here.

698
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,601
And only one to let you go.

699
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,485
Because it will please me.

700
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,889
Squire.

701
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,765
Well fought, ser.

702
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,524
That was no fight.

703
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,761
I don't know you.

704
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,207
Olyver, if it please you.

705
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,484
I should like to
see you spar with a proper partner, ser.

706
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,561
How did you know?

707
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,409
Know what?

708
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,729
That I wanted to.

709
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,609
My lord...

710
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,320
I'll have you know I'm to be married soon,

711
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,011
and even my intended
hasn't the slightest notion.

712
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,530
They rarely do, in my experience.

713
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,206
You have a good deal of experience, do you?

714
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,730
With the husbands.

715
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,003
That didn't take long.

716
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,563
Well, it took long enough.

717
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,210
It seems
our Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed.

718
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,805
Is he?

719
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,411
And...

720
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,043
Who's the lucky girl?

721
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,484
She may
not be the grandest ship in the world

722
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,444
or the fastest,

723
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,006
but she's mine.

724
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,566
I've always wanted a ship.
Now I want a dozen.

725
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,286
Strange, isn't it?

726
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,561
What is?

727
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,722
It doesn't matter what we want,

728
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,804
once we get it, then we want something else.

729
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,971
Your hair is different.

730
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,451
Is it?

731
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,251
Lady Margaery wears it that way.

732
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,322
Many ladies wear it this way.

733
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,687
I have good news. I'll be leaving the city soon.

734
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,046
You still want me to come with you?

735
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:28,329
It's not
a question of what I want. It's what you want.

736
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,805
You want to go home, don't you?

737
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,128
Of course. More than anything.

738
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,684
But maybe it would be better to wait.

739
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,969
I've been thinking how dangerous it would
be. Not just for me, but for you.

740
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,726
You've been so kind.
I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you.

741
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,843
I can't tell you how touched I am

742
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,963
by your concern for my welfare.

743
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,366
I hope you know that I'm your friend, Sansa.

744
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,969
Your true friend.

745
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,201
I do, Lord Baelish.

746
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,881
Petyr.

747
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,961
If you wish to stay,
then of course you will stay.

748
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,486
We'll speak again when I return.

749
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,085
You're late.

750
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,923
What's she doing here?

751
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,403
Our business concerns her, too.

752
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,126
Sit.

753
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,561
You'll be pleased to learn that

754
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,001
after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell,

755
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:50,844
I've saved the crown
hundreds of thousands on this wedding.

756
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,571
Never mind that now.
We have something important to discuss.

757
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,881
I'm Master of Coin.
Saving money is important.

758
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,289
Stop that. You're making me uncomfortable.

759
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:03,364
Your sister has learned
that your new friends the Tyrells

760
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,330
are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.

761
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,770
Very well. She's a lovely girl.

762
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,041
Missing some of Loras'
favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do.

763
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,360
Your jokes are not appreciated.

764
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:16,720
It wasn't my best, but...

765
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,883
I bring them into
the royal fold, and this is how they repay me,

766
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,611
by trying to steal
the key to the North out from under me.

767
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,365
Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to
remember she has an older brother.

768
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,283
The Karstarks have marched home.

769
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:32,523
The Young Wolf has
lost half his army. His days are numbered.

770
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,440
Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers.

771
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,888
That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell,

772
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,723
and I am not about
to hand her over to the Tyrells.

773
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,121
The Tyrell army is
helping us to win this war.

774
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,808
Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?

775
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,803
There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot.

776
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,561
Plots are not public knowledge.

777
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,565
And the Tyrells won't carry this one out
until after Joffrey's wedding.

778
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,326
We need to act first
and kill this union in its crib.

779
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,806
And how do we do that?

780
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,042
We find Sansa Stark a different husband.

781
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,281
Wonderful.

782
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,606
Yes, it is.

783
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,926
You can't mean it.

784
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,246
I can and I do.

785
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:20,085
Joffrey's made this poor girl's life miserable

786
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,931
since the day he took her father's head.

787
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,606
Now she's finally
free of him, and you give her to me?

788
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,045
That's cruel, even for you.

789
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,565
Do you intend on mistreating her?

790
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,244
The girl's happiness
is not my concern, nor yours.

791
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,606
She's a child!

792
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,365
She's flowered, I assure
you. She and I have discussed it at length.

793
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,050
There, you see? You will wed her,

794
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,685
bed her, and put a child in her.

795
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,566
Surely you're capable of that.

796
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:42,971
And if I refuse?

797
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,361
You wanted to be rewarded
for your valor in battle.

798
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,050
Sansa Stark is a finer
reward than you could ever dare hope for.

799
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,248
And it is past time you were wed.

800
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,845
I was wed.

801
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,890
Or don't you remember?

802
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,010
Only too well.

803
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:06,364
You should be thanking the Gods for this.
This is more than you deserve.

804
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,760
Tyrion will do as he's bid. As will you.

805
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,404
What do you mean?

806
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,289
You'll marry Ser Loras.

807
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,927
I will not.

808
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,081
The boy is heir to Highgarden.

809
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,606
Tyrion will secure the North,
you will secure the Reach.

810
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,125
No, I won't do it.

811
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,685
Yes, you will.

812
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,087
You're still fertile.
You need to marry again and breed.

813
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,162
I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare.

814
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,765
You're my daughter!

815
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,971
You will do as I command,
and you will marry Loras Tyrell

816
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:42,251
and put an end to the disgusting
rumors about you once and for all.

817
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,765
Father, don't make me do it again, please.

818
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,445
Not another word.

819
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,086
My children.

820
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,644
You've disgraced
the Lannister name for far too long.

1
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,646
You've got too
much wood in there.

2
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,408
But the more wood, the bigger the fire.

3
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,450
It needs to breathe.

4
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,523
Take off that big log.

5
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,241
Ah.

6
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,604
You know your fires.

7
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,962
Someone built your fires for you growing up?

8
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,766
It doesn't get so cold down in the Reach.

9
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,131
And there were servants, of course.

10
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,763
I knew you were highborn.

11
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,447
Oh, I found something
at the Fist of the First Men.

12
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,803
Buried treasure.
Thousands of years old. I think.

13
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,203
What does it do?

14
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,728
I'm not sure that it does anything.

15
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,047
It's beautiful, though, isn't it?

16
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,446
How much longer?

17
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,049
Not so far. A few more days.

18
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,203
Is the Wall as big as they say?

19
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,645
Bigger.

20
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,124
So big you can't even see the top sometimes.

21
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,051
It's hidden in clouds.

22
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,286
You're playing with me.

23
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,481
I'm not.

24
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:49,205
It's 700 feet high, all made of ice.

25
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,567
On a warm day you can see it weeping.

26
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,642
Castle Black is nice enough.

27
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,766
They keep a fire burning in the long
hall day and night.

28
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:10,883
And Hobb makes venison stew with onions.

29
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,291
Very tasty.

30
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,483
Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing.

31
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,365
Dareon sings best.

32
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,448
- Do you sing?
- No.

33
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,126
No, no, no. Not very well.

34
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,204
Sing me a song.

35
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,210
Oh, all right. Let's see.

36
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,201
Oh.

37
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,369
The Father's face is stern and strong

38
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,649
He sits and judges right from wrong

39
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,849
He weighs our lives, the short and long

40
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,204
And loves the little children

41
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,040
The Mother gives the gift of life

42
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,762
And watches over every wife

43
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,250
Her gentle smile ends all strife

44
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,089
And she loves her little children

45
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,771
That's not how you skin a rabbit.

46
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,331
I know how to skin a rabbit.

47
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,243
Not by the looks of it.

48
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,125
You grow up north of the Wall,

49
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,844
you learn the proper way to handle game.

50
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,082
I didn't see any game before I got here.

51
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,484
If I had a bow, I could have shot a dozen.

52
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,445
Well, I made this bow myself.

53
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,682
Guess you don't learn
how to do that north of the Wall.

54
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,763
You learn how to use your fists.

55
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,763
Oh, you're gonna punch the rabbits to death?

56
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,330
I had someone else in mind.

57
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,686
Well, someone else is sitting right here.

58
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,491
You're both very good at skinning rabbits.

59
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,291
Some of us are just a little better.

60
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,726
Well, some of us would say thank you

61
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,041
when someone else
hunts down their breakfast for them.

62
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,362
Or don't they teach you
to say thank you north of the Wall?

63
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,962
You've got
a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth.

64
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,645
Stop it!
Hmm.

65
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,570
- Hodor.
- You've been fighting since you met.

66
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,807
Just stop it.

67
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,928
Lady Reed here's got a stick so far up her ass,

68
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,042
it's a wonder her feet touch the ground.

69
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,761
You've been nasty
to her every day. Of course she's nasty back.

70
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,569
Me? It's my fault?

71
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,324
First time I met her,
she put a knife to my throat.

72
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,927
First time I met you, you held a knife at me.

73
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,125
We can't fight each other.
We'll never make it to the Wall.

74
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,004
I want you both to make peace.

75
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,890
Your way of skinning rabbits is quicker.

76
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,490
I said so, didn't I?

77
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,601
Osha!

78
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,931
You're a good little hunter.

79
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,925
Thank you. See? Not so hard, is it?

80
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,002
- Thank you.
- Don't push me.

81
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,324
I'm right here with you.

82
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,527
What's happening?

83
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,650
I'm right here with you.

84
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,521
What's wrong with him?

85
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,722
The visions take their toll.

86
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,005
He's having one now?

87
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,522
I saw Jon Snow.

88
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,762
You saw him? At Castle Black?

89
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,645
He was on the wrong side of the Wall,

90
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,081
surrounded by enemies.

91
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,448
Used to be you couldn't find a
tree within a mile of the Wall.

92
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,531
Crows would come out
every morning with axes.

93
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,890
Your flock gets smaller every year.

94
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,530
You ever climbed it before?

95
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,211
No.

96
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,445
But Tormund's done it half a hundred times.

97
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,489
You're afraid.

98
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,281
Aren't you?

99
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,441
Aye.

100
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,564
Well, it's a long way up and a long way down.

101
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,647
But I've waited
my whole life to see the world from up there.

102
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,211
Here, sit down. I brought a pair for you.

103
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,765
They're too big for you, but they're good.

104
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,490
You kill someone for them?

105
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,565
Nah.

106
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,725
I didn't kill him,
but I bet his balls are still bruised.

107
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,531
He wasn't good to me
the way you're good to me.

108
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,009
Well, he didn't do
that thing you do with your tongue.

109
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,010
Can we not talk about that here?

110
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,445
"Can we not talk about that here?

111
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,251
"I'm Jon Snow.

112
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,402
"I've killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand,

113
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,602
"but I'm scared of naked girls."

114
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,920
Did I seem scared the other day?

115
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,570
You were trembling like a leaf.

116
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,244
Only in the beginning.

117
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,726
Huh.

118
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,529
Only in the beginning.

119
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,209
You're a proper lover, Jon Snow.

120
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,444
And don't worry.

121
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,724
Your secret's safe with me.

122
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,129
What secret?

123
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,202
Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls

124
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,402
in silk dresses you knew growing up?

125
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,644
You're loyal and you're brave.

126
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,965
You didn't stop being a crow
the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent.

127
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,247
But I'm your woman now, Jon Snow.

128
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,808
You're going to be loyal to your woman.

129
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,445
The Night's Watch don't care if you live or die.

130
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,924
Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die.

131
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,766
We're just soldiers
and there's more to carry on if we go down.

132
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,083
It's you and me that matters to me and you.

133
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,241
Don't ever betray me.

134
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,046
I Won't.

135
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,926
'Cause I'll cut your pretty cock right
off and wear it 'round me neck.

136
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,929
Sink your metal deep

137
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,447
and make sure it holds
before taking your next step.

138
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,928
And if you fall, don't scream.

139
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,561
You don't want that
to be the last thing she remembers.

140
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,687
Joffrey.

141
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,801
Cersei.

142
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,561
Ilyn Payne.

143
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,526
You're good.

144
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,131
You're not as good as you think you are.

145
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,561
Face, tits, balls...

146
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,721
I hit 'em right where I wanted to.

147
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,966
Aye,

148
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,681
but you took your sweet time of it.

149
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,011
You won't be fighting straw men, little lady.

150
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,330
Show me your position.

151
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,330
Keep your elbow high.

152
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,125
You want your back doing the hard labor.

153
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,361
You're holding.

154
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,520
Never hold.

155
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,570
What?

156
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,210
Your muscles tense up when you hold.

157
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,887
Pull the string back to
the center of your chin and release.

158
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,246
Never hold.

159
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,725
But I have to aim.

160
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,526
Never aim.

161
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,210
Never aim?

162
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,844
Your eye knows
where it wants the arrow to go.

163
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,891
Trust your eye.

164
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,244
There's someone out there.

165
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,167
That's about far enough.

166
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,771
We come as friends.

167
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,211
Begging your pardon, m'lady,

168
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,044
but we'll be the judge of that.

169
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,365
Valar Morghulis.

170
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,408
Valar Dohaeris.

171
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,202
I don't see many priestesses of R'hllor
in the Riverlands.

172
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,561
You are Thoros of Myr.

173
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,964
The High Priest gave you a mission.

174
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,240
Turn King Robert away from his idols
and towards the Lord of Light.

175
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,126
What happened?

176
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,890
I failed.

177
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,488
You quit, you mean.

178
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,282
The heathen continue to slaughter each other
and you continue to get drunk.

179
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:40,601
You worship Him your way,
and I'll worship Him mine.

180
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,363
Do you speak the Common tongue?

181
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,131
My friends here don't speak High Valyrian.

182
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,164
Why are you here, my lady?

183
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,808
Forgive my manners.

184
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,769
I don't see many ladies these days.

185
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,569
Lucky for the ladies.

186
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,283
How many times has
the Lord brought him back?

187
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,169
Six.

188
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,682
That's not possible.

189
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,921
The Lord has smiled upon me.

190
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,049
You should not have this power.

191
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,282
I have no power.

192
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,766
I ask the Lord for His favor,

193
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,922
and He responds as He will.

194
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,882
I've always been a terrible priest.

195
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,890
Drank too much rum.

196
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,208
Fucked all the whores in King's Landing.

197
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,610
It's a terrible thing to say,

198
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,809
but by the time I came
to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord.

199
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,491
I decided that He, that all the Gods,

200
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,962
were stories we
told the children to make them behave.

201
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,084
So I wore the robes,
and every now and then I'd recite the prayers,

202
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,811
but it was just for show.

203
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,682
A spectacle for the locals.

204
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,043
Until the Mountain
drove a lance through this one's heart.

205
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:59,320
I knelt beside his cold body
and said the old words.

206
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,241
Not because I believed in them, but...

207
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,162
He was my friend and he was dead.

208
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,609
And they were the only words I knew.

209
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,204
And for the first
time in my life, the Lord replied.

210
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,850
Beric's eyes opened, and I knew the truth.

211
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,206
Our god is the one true god.

212
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,082
And all men must serve Him.

213
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,168
You've been to the other side.

214
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,810
The other side?

215
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,608
There is no other side.

216
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,681
I have been to the darkness, my lady.

217
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,731
He sent you to us for a reason.

218
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,924
You have someone He needs.

219
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,561
Bodkin point.

220
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,168
Penetrates plate at 200 yards.

221
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,281
Can you make 'em?

222
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,763
Yeah, nothing tricky about it.
Just need decent steel.

223
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,841
I'll get you the steel.

224
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,566
Come on.

225
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,686
I don't like that woman.

226
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,283
That's 'cause you're a girl.

227
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,291
What does that have to do with anything?

228
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,161
Forgive me, lad.

229
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,364
What are you doing? Let go of him.

230
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,881
- Tell them to stop.
- Come on.

231
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,881
He wants to be one of you.
He wants to join the Brotherhood. Stop them!

232
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,522
We serve the Lord of Light,
and the Lord of Light needs this boy.

233
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,888
Did the Lord of Light tell you that, or did she?

234
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,770
You're not doing this for your god.

235
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,891
You're doing it for gold.

236
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,731
We're doing it for both, girl.

237
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,802
We can't defend the people without
weapons and horses and food.

238
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,570
And we can't get weapons
and horses and food without gold.

239
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,885
You told me
this was a Brotherhood.

240
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,846
You told me I could be one of you.

241
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,522
You are more than they can ever be.

242
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,286
They're just foot soldiers in the great war.

243
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,761
You will make kings rise and fall.

244
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,810
You're a witch. You're going to hurt him.

245
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,009
I see a darkness in you.

246
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,644
And in that darkness,
eyes staring back at me...

247
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,803
Brown eyes,

248
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,009
blue eyes, green eyes.

249
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,082
Eyes you'll shut forever.

250
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,808
We will meet again.

251
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,567
You staring at me ass, Jon Snow?

252
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,321
Look out!

253
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,371
You all right?

254
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,483
Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad.

255
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,203
Sorry. Were you sleeping?

256
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,647
Wa...

257
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,090
Wa... Wa...

258
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,087
Water? You want some water.

259
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,485
I wish I had some for you.

260
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,485
So, let's play a game.

261
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,685
Which body part do you need the least?

262
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,571
Please.

263
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,324
"Please" is not a body part.

264
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,971
I'll tell you everything, please.

265
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,127
But you've already told me everything.

266
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,050
Remember?

267
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,486
Your daddy was mean to you.

268
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,961
The Starks didn't appreciate you.

269
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,165
One good bit, though.

270
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,245
The Stark boys, they're still alive.

271
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,330
Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember?

272
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,121
You failed, but I'm a better hunter than you.

273
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,049
Now...

274
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,003
How about your little
finger? You don't use that for much, do you?

275
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,011
No? Good. Let's start with that.

276
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,726
Ah!

277
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,849
You've been wondering
why you're here, haven't you?

278
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,205
Where you are.

279
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,487
Who I am. Why I'm doing this to you.

280
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,281
So, guess.

281
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,970
If you guess right, I'll tell you.

282
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,970
By the Old Gods and the New, I swear it.

283
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,045
You win the game

284
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,567
if you can figure out
who I am and why I'm torturing you,

285
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,928
and I win the game
if you beg me to cut off your finger.

286
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,489
If I win, you'll let me go?

287
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,725
If you think this has a happy ending,

288
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,565
you haven't been paying attention.

289
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,210
Please.

290
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,048
You say "please" again
and you'll wish you hadn't.

291
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,849
You first. Where are we?

292
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,761
The North.

293
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,607
Too vague.

294
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,081
Deepwood Motte.

295
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,409
Terrible guess.

296
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,283
Now, where?

297
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,002
Last Hearth.

298
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,560
Do I look like
a fucking Umber to you?

299
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,122
Karhold!

300
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,810
Karhold?

301
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,844
How did you know that?

302
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,245
Did you see any banners
flying when we came in?

303
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,560
No.

304
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,485
It was just a guess.

305
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,645
Very good, Lord Theon.

306
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,481
And who am I?

307
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,365
Torrhen Karstark.

308
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,845
He's dead.

309
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,691
Strangled by the Kingslayer.

310
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,364
He was your brother.

311
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,321
Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark.

312
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,926
You swore to tell me if I...

313
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,246
You're right.

314
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,921
Lord Rickard Karstark
is Robb Stark's bannerman.

315
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,964
I betrayed Robb.

316
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,367
That's why you're torturing me.

317
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,770
Yes.

318
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,521
You win.

319
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,007
Of course, you forgot to ask one question.

320
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,686
You forgot to ask if I'm a liar.

321
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,883
I'm afraid I am.

322
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,971
Everything I told you is a lie.

323
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,371
This isn't happening to you for a reason.

324
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,602
But, well, one reason...

325
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,167
I enjoy it.

326
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,410
Please, cut it off! Cut it off! Cut it off!

327
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,286
I win.

328
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,041
Thank you for riding here so quickly.

329
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,481
I know travel isn't easy in these times.

330
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,251
The roads are crawling
with cutthroats and bandits.

331
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,130
When the King of
the North summons us, we come.

332
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,923
Our father
has instructed us to tell you that his alliance

333
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,846
with the North can continue
if his terms are met.

334
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,809
Lord Frey requires a formal apology

335
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,047
for your violation of your sacred oath
to marry one of his daughters.

336
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,045
Of course.
He deserves as much. I was in the wrong.

337
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,566
As restitution for this betrayal,

338
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,769
he demands Harrenhal
and all its attendant lands.

339
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,205
I don't think that's...

340
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,651
We are fighting for the North.

341
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,327
Harrenhal is not in the North.

342
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,970
It is his once the war is over and we have no
further strategic need for it.

343
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,609
And there's something else.

344
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,049
We will do whatever
we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.

345
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,567
Not what, whom.

346
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,961
What?

347
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,041
Uh, no.

348
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:52,166
Our father requires Lord Edmure to
wed one of his daughters. Roslin.

349
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,321
How old is she?

350
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,487
Nineteen.

351
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,840
Could I see her first?

352
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,331
You want to count her teeth?

353
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,003
We depart for the Twins in the morning.

354
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,083
We need an answer before we leave,

355
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,810
and a wedding not more
than a fortnight thereafter

356
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,484
or this alliance is at an end.

357
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,486
Your father does
realize we're in the middle of a war?

358
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,963
Father is old.

359
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,765
It will put his heart at peace if he could see
her wed to a good husband.

360
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,445
And his recent experience
has made him wary of long engagements.

361
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,804
He has every right to be.

362
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,002
Please excuse us while we discuss it.

363
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,282
Why should I let
that old ferret choose my bride for me?

364
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,250
At the very least,
I should be offered the same choice you were.

365
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,890
I'm his liege lord.

366
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,122
He's a proud man
and we've wounded him.

367
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,568
I didn't wound him. My answer is no.

368
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:05,602
Listen to me and listen very carefully. You...

369
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,251
The laws of gods and men are very clear.

370
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,971
No man can compel another man to marry.

371
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,327
The laws of my fist
are about to compel your teeth.

372
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,801
It's all right. You heard him.

373
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,725
If you refuse,
our alliance with the Freys is dead.

374
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,564
He's wanted me for
one of his daughters since I was 12.

375
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,449
He's not gonna stop wanting it now.

376
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,488
When I say no, he will come back

377
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,648
and offer me a daughter of my choosing.

378
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,324
You're willing to risk our freedom

379
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,124
and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?

380
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,809
I have a war to fight.

381
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,405
We can't win it without them.
I have no time to haggle.

382
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,602
You said you wanted
to make amends for the Stone Mill.

383
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,290
You recall that heroic engagement?

384
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,248
I had something less permanent in mind.

385
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,447
I've won every battle, but I'm losing this war.

386
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,601
If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost.

387
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,646
I'll marry her.

388
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,003
You're paying
for my sins, Uncle. It's not fair or right.

389
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,445
I'll remember it.

390
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,441
I see my men have finally found
you something appropriate to wear.

391
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,688
Yes. Most kind of them.

392
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,442
You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton.

393
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,841
I am acting on Lady Stark's orders

394
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,321
to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing.

395
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,041
When King Robb left
Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner.

396
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,488
If she wasn't his mother,
he'd have hanged her for treason.

397
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,081
I should send you back to Robb Stark.

398
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,403
You should.

399
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:04,684
But instead,
you're sitting here, watching me fail at dinner.

400
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,643
Why might that be?

401
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,691
Wars cost money.
Many people would pay a great deal for you.

402
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,207
We both know who would pay the most.

403
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,049
Or make you pay the most
if he found out you had captured me

404
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,361
and sent me back up north
for a summary execution.

405
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,045
You're right.

406
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,602
Perhaps the safest thing
to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.

407
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,001
It would be,

408
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,849
if you honestly believed
my father would never find out about it.

409
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,161
King Robb is keeping your father quite busy.

410
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,521
He doesn't have time for anything else.

411
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,411
He'll make time for you.

412
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,648
As soon as you're well enough to travel,

413
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,808
I will allow you to go to King's Landing

414
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,407
as restitution
for the mistakes my soldiers made.

415
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,764
And you will swear to
tell your father the truth,

416
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,366
that I had nothing to do with your maiming.

417
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,526
Shall we drink on it?

418
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,880
I don't partake.

419
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,406
You do understand
how suspicious that is to ordinary people?

420
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,450
Very well.

421
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:21,411
My lady, may our journey
continue without further incident.

422
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,925
Oh, she won't be going with you.

423
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,687
I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to...

424
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,240
You are charged
with abetting treason.

425
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,722
I'm afraid I must insist.

426
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,280
You're in no place to insist on anything.

427
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,411
I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson

428
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,126
about overplaying your position.

429
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,164
Impossible.
- Why?

430
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,050
My grandson is the pride of Highgarden.

431
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,043
The most desirable bachelor
in all seven kingdoms.

432
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,563
- Your daughter...
- Is rich,

433
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,042
the most beautiful woman
in all seven kingdoms,

434
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,445
and the mother of the King.

435
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,601
Old.

436
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,681
Old?

437
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,160
Old.

438
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,241
I'm something of an expert on the subject.

439
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,801
Her change will be upon her before long.

440
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,441
I'll spare you the details
of what will happen then.

441
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,091
You may have a stomach
for bloodshed and slaughter,

442
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,328
but this is another matter entirely.

443
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,122
The years punish us as well,
I promise you that.

444
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:30,571
My stomach remains quite strong, however.

445
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,640
The only thing that might turn it are details

446
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,320
of your grandson's nocturnal activities.

447
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,527
Do you deny them?

448
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,727
Oh, not at all.

449
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,689
A sword-swallower through and through.

450
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,288
A boy with his affliction
should be grateful for the opportunity

451
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,011
to marry
the most beautiful woman in the Kingdoms

452
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,562
and remove the stain from his name.

453
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,731
Did you grow up
with boy cousins, Lord Tywin?

454
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,566
Sons of your
father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?

455
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,530
Of course.

456
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,003
And you never...

457
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,081
No.

458
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,804
Not once? Not in any way?

459
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,925
Never.

460
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,642
I congratulate you upon your restraint.

461
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,929
But it's natural,
boys having a go beneath the sheets.

462
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,321
Perhaps Highgarden
has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.

463
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,765
I wouldn't say that.

464
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,401
True, we don't tie ourselves in knots

465
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,006
over a discreet bit of buggery, but

466
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,882
brothers and sisters...

467
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,043
Where I come from,
that stain would be very difficult to wash out.

468
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,647
I will not breathe further life

469
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,967
into a malicious lie by discussing it.

470
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,651
Lie or not,

471
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,008
you must admit many people
find it quite convincing.

472
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,447
Convincing enough
to put swords in their hands

473
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,729
and send them off
to kill Lannisters and Tyrells,

474
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,569
thanks to our new affiliation.

475
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,729
I don't care what people believe.

476
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,560
And neither do you.

477
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,165
As an authority on myself, I must disagree.

478
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,806
Now, if the rumors about
my children were true,

479
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,768
then Joffrey is no king at all,

480
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,842
and House Tyrell
is throwing its prized flower into the dirt.

481
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,730
And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children,

482
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,684
we're throwing another
prized flower into the dirt.

483
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,445
It is a chance we simply cannot take.

484
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,442
The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable?

485
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,641
All right.

486
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,366
I'll remove it for you.

487
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,330
If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei,

488
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,284
I will name him to the Kingsguard.

489
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,651
I'm sure you're familiar
with the Kingsguard vows.

490
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,521
He will never marry.
He will never have children.

491
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,241
Ah.

492
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,566
The Tyrell name will fade.

493
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,727
And Highgarden will
go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.

494
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:02,090
You would have your grandson protected
by someone who disgusts you?

495
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,881
I would have my grandson
protected by a skilled warrior

496
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,009
who takes his vows seriously.

497
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,686
So, shall I draw up the order?

498
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,642
Or do you consent to this match?

499
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:26,523
It's a rare enough thing,
a man who lives up to his reputation.

500
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,486
No!

501
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,083
We've gotta cut them loose!

502
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,084
No!

503
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,450
Take my hand!

504
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,568
That's a wonderful pin.

505
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,283
It's more of a brooch, really.

506
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,570
Though I suppose a brooch
is a sort of pin, so...

507
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,010
I'm very happy about...

508
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,603
Yes. I am as well.

509
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,004
I feel like I'm in a dream.

510
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,202
Yes, me, too. Definitely.

511
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,486
I've dreamed of
a large wedding since I was young.

512
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,882
The guests, the food, the tournaments.

513
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,525
And the bride, of course.

514
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,686
The most beautiful bride in the world

515
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,771
in a beautiful gown of
gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves.

516
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,523
Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?

517
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,449
No. I had never left Winterfell

518
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,528
before I came to King's Landing.

519
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,643
But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it.

520
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,689
And to leave this place.

521
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,650
It's terrible, isn't it?

522
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,608
The most terrible place there is.

523
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,449
I don't suppose
there's anything we can do about this.

524
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,324
We can have them both killed.

525
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,529
It's hard to say which of the four of us

526
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,483
is getting the worst of this arrangement.

527
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,483
Probably Sansa.

528
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,327
Though Loras will certainly come to
know a deep and singular misery.

529
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,323
Father doesn't discriminate.

530
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,169
We're all being shipped off to hell together.

531
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,004
On a boat you built.

532
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,002
The Tyrells were plotting
to undermine our family.

533
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,526
I did what I did to protect our family.

534
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,045
I'm your family.

535
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,121
A member of your family who has actively

536
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,641
contributed to that family's survival.

537
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,131
Whether or not you
or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.

538
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,971
I do admit it.

539
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,811
If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire,

540
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,929
Stannis would
have sacked the city before Father got here.

541
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,241
Our heads would still be
rotting on the city gate.

542
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:39,370
Trying to have me killed
is an odd way of saying thank you.

543
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,802
There are two people in King's Landing

544
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,008
who can give an order to a Kingsguard.

545
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,811
Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon

546
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,691
to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?

547
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,688
The impulse I understand.

548
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,971
He hates me because I'm the only one

549
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,731
who tells him what he really is.

550
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:20,363
So, fair enough.
He wants me dead. But his stupidity?

551
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,368
He could have had me
poisoned and no one would have known.

552
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,842
But the King orders a Kingsguard

553
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,766
to murder the Hand
of the King in full view of his own army.

554
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,330
The boy's an idiot.

555
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,930
What do you want me to say?

556
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,810
I want you to tell me
if my life is still in danger.

557
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,370
Probably.

558
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,483
But not from Joffrey.
He won't do anything now Father's here.

559
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,490
Seven kingdoms united in fear
of Tywin Lannister.

560
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,725
Not the Tyrells.

561
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,642
Soon they won't need to be afraid of him.

562
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,122
Joffrey will
belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore,

563
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,010
and so will his children and their children.

564
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,082
History will be taken from our hands.

565
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,329
You may escape, at least.

566
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,525
Once Jaime gets back,

567
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:13,730
Ser Loras may come down with a terrible
case of sword through bowels.

568
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,448
When Jaime gets back, yes.

569
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,569
But when will that be?
He's out there somewhere.

570
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,441
Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked.

571
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,688
Who's going to tell her?

572
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,249
Do you think people will like it?

573
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,249
I don't think they will even notice it.

574
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,287
You're right. It's not my wedding.

575
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,366
Anyway, from what I can tell,

576
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,329
the dressmakers in Highgarden will be

577
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,329
far superior to the ones in King's Landing.

578
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,524
They'd never make me
anything as dull as this for my wedding.

579
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,570
Loras likes green and gold brocade.

580
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,449
I'm sure he does.

581
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,969
Will they let me invite my family?

582
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,288
They haven't asked my opinion.

583
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,203
But do you think they will?

584
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,410
No.

585
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,481
Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you.

586
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,721
Should I...

587
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,723
I beg your pardon, my lady.

588
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,123
Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion.
I was trying on a gown for Joffrey's wedding.

589
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,767
Yes, it should be quite a wedding.

590
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,491
I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa.

591
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,641
Of course.

592
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,290
Alone, if I may.

593
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,124
Why do you need to speak to her alone?

594
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,969
Shae.

595
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,883
Please excuse her. She's not from here.

596
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,686
But I trust her,
even though she tells me not to.

597
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:51,362
Sometimes we think
we want to hear something,

598
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,320
and it's only afterwards, when it's too late,

599
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,641
that we realize we wished we'd heard it

600
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,967
under entirely different circumstances.

601
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,886
It's all right, really.

602
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,242
How to begin?

603
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,331
It's... This...

604
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,084
This... This is awkward.

605
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,048
A thousand blades

606
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,964
taken from the hands
of Aegon's fallen enemies,

607
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,328
forged in the fiery breath
of Balerion the Dread.

608
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,209
There aren't 1,000 blades.

609
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,801
There aren't even 200.

610
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,281
I've counted.

611
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,644
I'm sure you have.

612
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,210
Ugly old thing.

613
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,885
Yet it has a certain appeal.

614
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,328
The Lysa Arryn of chairs.

615
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,370
Shame you had to settle
for your second choice.

616
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,488
Early days, my friend.

617
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,006
It is flattering, really,

618
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:59,007
you feeling such dread
at the prospect of me getting what I want.

619
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:03,404
Thwarting you has never
been my primary ambition, I promise you.

620
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,290
Although who doesn't like to see

621
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,050
their friends fail now and then?

622
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,451
You're so right.

623
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,406
For instance, when I thwarted your plan

624
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,166
to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells.

625
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,129
If I'm going to be honest,

626
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:20,842
I did feel an unmistakable
sense of enjoyment there.

627
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,521
But your confidant,

628
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,047
the one who fed
you information about my plans,

629
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,691
the one you swore to protect...

630
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,242
You didn't bring her any enjoyment.

631
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,768
And she didn't bring me any enjoyment.

632
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,211
She was a bad investment on my part.

633
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:49,610
Luckily, I have a friend
who wanted to try something new.

634
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,249
Something daring.

635
00:47:53,640 --> 00:48:00,171
And he was so grateful
to me for providing this fresh experience.

636
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,160
I did what I did for the good of the realm.

637
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,085
The realm?

638
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,087
Do you know what the realm is?

639
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,323
It's the 1,000 blades of Aegon's enemies.

640
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:22,566
A story we agree
to tell each other over and over,

641
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,642
till we forget that it's a lie.

642
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,409
But what do we have left
once we abandon the lie?

643
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:33,929
Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.

644
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,685
Chaos isn't a pit.

645
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,843
Chaos is a ladder.

646
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,927
Many who try to climb it fail
and never get to try again.

647
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,481
The fall breaks them.

648
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:04,810
And some are given
a chance to climb, but they refuse.

649
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:12,650
They cling to the realm or the Gods or love.

650
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,044
Illusions.

651
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,928
Only the ladder is real.

652
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,882
The climb is all there is.

1
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,167
How far are we?

2
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,120
About a week, I think.

3
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,571
You think?

4
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,126
You don't know?

5
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,841
When we went to Castle Black, we took
the King's Road.

6
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,571
You and your roads.

7
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,963
Is that how you lot do your fighting?

8
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,402
You march down the road
banging drums and waving banners?

9
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,209
Most of the time, yes.

10
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,447
How do the men holding the banners fight?

11
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,645
They don't, really.

12
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,921
It's a great honor to carry your house sigil.

13
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,050
And the drummers...
Is that a great honor, too?

14
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,040
Usually it's the young boys
banging the drums.

15
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,845
So, what good are they?

16
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,649
They help the men march.

17
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,161
How?

18
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,924
Well, it's...

19
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,680
It's the rhythm.

20
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,047
Oh, you mean right foot, left foot,

21
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,447
right foot, left foot, right foot?

22
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,761
What, you need help remembering that?

23
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,122
When Mance gives the signal
and we hit Castle Black,

24
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,124
we won't be banging
on drums to let them know we're coming.

25
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,561
No.

26
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,690
No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire

27
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,683
the North has ever seen
to let them know you're coming.

28
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,607
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

29
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,848
She's right, you don't.

30
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,127
I know you cut me loose on the Wall.

31
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,966
Cut her loose, too.
Do you see her sulking about it?

32
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,801
That's because
she understands the way things are.

33
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,888
And are you gonna share it with me,

34
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,809
the deep wisdom you found
inside the head of a bird?

35
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,049
People work together when it suits them.

36
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,083
They're loyal when it suits them.

37
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,561
They love each other when it suits them.

38
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,160
And they kill each other when it suits them.

39
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,603
She knows that, you don't.

40
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,846
Which is why you'll never hold on to her.

41
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,604
That rain will cost us another day.

42
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,925
Frey will wait. He knows we're coming.

43
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,207
Lord Walder is prickly by nature. If...

44
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,408
"Prickly"? That what you call it?

45
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,682
Might be the least pleasant man I've ever met.

46
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,886
Yes, and that is why...

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,971
I've seen wet shits
I liked better than Walder Frey.

48
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,284
Apologies, Your Grace.

49
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,807
I've spent too many years
around lancers and pikemen.

50
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,010
I've spent two years nursing wounded
men, watching them bleed and die.

51
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,563
I'm not afraid of wet shits.

52
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,806
Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.

53
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,484
He can take it as he likes.

54
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,564
He's getting the wedding he wanted.

55
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,205
He's getting a wedding.

56
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,765
It was a king he wanted.

57
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,726
Edmure is the best match
a Frey has had in the history of their house.

58
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,086
We should all get some sleep.

59
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,603
If you don't put some clothes on,

60
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,563
I can't promise I won't attack you again.

61
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,564
Attack. Attack.

62
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,650
Who are you writing?

63
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,690
My mother.

64
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,840
Is that Valyrian?

65
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,527
Gaaa.

66
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,729
"Gaaa"?

67
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,762
Say hello for me.

68
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,009
Rytsas.

69
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,801
"Ritsas."

70
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,005
That was close enough.

71
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,203
Does she know her daughter's a queen?

72
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,931
Not yet.

73
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,446
That will be a surprise, I expect.

74
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,810
Many surprises for her.

75
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,402
How am I supposed to sit here planning a war

76
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,602
when you're over there, looking like that?

77
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,487
Will you come with me one day to Volantis?

78
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,003
When all this is over?

79
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,411
I will.

80
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,201
I promise.

81
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,008
I know she'd love to meet you.

82
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,924
And her grandchild.

83
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,001
What, now?

84
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,969
Are you certain?

85
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,604
Are you angry with me?

86
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,845
Angry?

87
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,289
You're my queen.

88
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,366
And I have your
little prince or princess inside me.

89
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,724
Maybe one of each.

90
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,570
Don't get greedy.

91
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,240
Can you leave the war for one night?

92
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,850
I love you.

93
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,085
Do you hear me?

94
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,244
I love you.

95
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,207
Most men fuck like dogs.

96
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,688
No grace, no skill.
A few dozen thrusts, and done.

97
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,806
You need to be patient. Give her time.

98
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,766
Your cock shouldn't go near her

99
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,451
till she's slick as a baby seal.

100
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,640
And then you go inside, but slowly.

101
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,807
Don't jam it in like
you're spearing a pig.

102
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,961
Come on!

103
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,530
Hey, come on.

104
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,369
You think he loves you, is that it?

105
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,004
What did he tell you?
He's gonna make you his lady

106
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,367
and live with you in some castle?

107
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,286
No, he didn't tell me anything. He barely talks.

108
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,888
I've seen you two whispering in the
night, giggling like a pair of girls.

109
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,803
What, you're jealous?

110
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,487
Of course I'm jealous.
You should be with one of your own.

111
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,360
And you're one of my own?
I've never heard a kind word from your mouth.

112
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,801
You would if you were mine.

113
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:51,000
I'd tell you that
you're beautiful and fierce and wild.

114
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,570
I'd be good to you.

115
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,090
You love him?

116
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,051
'Cause he's pretty? Is that it?

117
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,811
You like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes?

118
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,206
You think pretty is gonna make you happy?

119
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,486
Don't touch me.

120
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,882
You won't love him so much
when you find out what he really is.

121
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,770
Growing up at Winterfell,

122
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,405
all I ever wanted was to escape,

123
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,762
to come here to the capital.

124
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,841
See the southern knights
and their painted armor

125
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,440
and King's Landing after dark.

126
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,644
All the candles burning in all those windows.

127
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,043
I'm stupid.

128
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,443
A stupid little girl
with stupid dreams who never learns.

129
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,800
Come on.

130
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,766
Come walk with me.

131
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,084
I remember the first time
I saw you in the throne room.

132
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,209
I'd never seen anyone
who looked so unhappy.

133
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,605
I want very much for you to be happy,
Sansa, and so does my grandmother.

134
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,365
You would have been happy at Highgarden,

135
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,286
but women in our position
must make the best of our circumstances.

136
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,965
How do I make the best
of my circumstances? I have to marry him.

137
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,087
Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?

138
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,161
No.

139
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,049
Has he been kind to you?

140
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,490
He's tried.

141
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,690
You don't want him, though.

142
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,761
He's a Lannister.

143
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,571
Far from the worst Lannister,
wouldn't you say?

144
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,491
I'm sorry. Here I am complaining to you...

145
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,844
My son will be king.

146
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,728
Sons learn from their
mothers. I plan to teach mine a great deal.

147
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,411
And your son, if I'm not mistaken,

148
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,081
your son might be the Lord of Casterly
Rock and the North someday.

149
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,726
What?

150
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,010
My son...

151
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,131
With him.

152
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,562
I'll have to...

153
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,924
We'll have to...

154
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,809
If it's the pain you're worried about...

155
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,204
I'm not afraid of the
pain. Not after what Joffrey's done to me.

156
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,726
What is it, then?

157
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,682
He's rather good-looking,
even with the scar. Especially with the scar.

158
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,841
He's a dwarf.

159
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,845
And Loras...

160
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,080
Loras.

161
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,331
Some women like tall men.
Some like short men.

162
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,971
Some like hairy men. Some like bald men.

163
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,409
Gentle men, rough men,
ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls.

164
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,364
Most women don't know
what they like until they've tried it.

165
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,005
And, sadly, so many of us
get to try so little before we're old and gray.

166
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,603
Tyrion may surprise you.
From what I've heard, he's quite experienced.

167
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,809
And that's a good thing?

168
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,211
It can be.

169
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,570
We're very complicated,
you know. Pleasing us takes practice.

170
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,329
How do you know all this?

171
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,004
Did your mother teach you?

172
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,011
Yes, sweet girl. My mother taught me.

173
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,370
She's a child.

174
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,965
She's a foot taller than you.

175
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,644
A tall Child.

176
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,004
What's the youngest you've ever had?

177
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,525
Not that young.

178
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,045
How much older?

179
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,606
Older.

180
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,961
You're a lord, she's a lady.

181
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,251
And a beauty, at that. I don't see the problem.

182
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,402
Shae isn't going to like it.

183
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,289
Shae is a whore.

184
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,170
Are you gonna marry her, eh?

185
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,403
How did marrying
a whore work out for you the first time?

186
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,131
I should never have told you about that.

187
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,602
You want Shae, keep her.
Wed one and bed the other.

188
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,684
All you have to do
is get a son in the Stark girl.

189
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,489
He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day.

190
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,444
You can rule the North in his name.

191
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,605
You'll have two women
and a whole kingdom of your own.

192
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,651
Two women to despise me
and a whole kingdom to join them.

193
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,808
You waste time trying
to get people to love you,

194
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,531
you'll end up
the most popular dead man in town.

195
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,289
You want to fuck that Stark girl.

196
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,243
You just don't want to admit it.

197
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,723
I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head.

198
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,000
The ones already there don't need company.

199
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,924
You pay me to kill people who bother you.

200
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,202
Evil notions come free.

201
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,131
Your Grace.

202
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,290
Grandfather.

203
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,370
You wanted to speak to me?

204
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,010
Yes.

205
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,641
I'd like
a report on the meetings of my Small Council.

206
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,209
You're welcome to attend the meetings

207
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,129
of your Small Council, Your Grace.

208
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,681
Any or all of them.

209
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,524
I've been very busy.

210
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,171
Many important matters
require a king's attention.

211
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,605
Of course.

212
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,880
You've been holding the council meetings

213
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,601
in the Tower of the Hand
instead of the Small Council chamber.

214
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,170
I have, yes.

215
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,370
May I ask why?

216
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,166
Well, the Tower of the Hand is where I work.

217
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,325
To walk from there to here would take time,

218
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,284
time I could otherwise spend productively.

219
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,647
So if I wanted to attend a council meeting,

220
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,685
I would now have to
climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?

221
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,930
We could arrange to have you carried.

222
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,122
Tell me about the Targaryen girl
in the east and her dragons.

223
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,840
Where did you hear about this?

224
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,321
Is it true?

225
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,250
Apparently so.

226
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,281
Don't you think we ought
to do something about it?

227
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,926
When I was Hand of
the King under your father's predecessor,

228
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,847
the skulls of all
the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room.

229
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,526
The skull of the last of them was right here.

230
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,722
It was the size of an apple.

231
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,289
And the biggest was the size of a carriage.

232
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,400
Yes, and the creature
to whom it belonged died 300 years ago.

233
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,081
Curiosities on
the far side of the world are no threat to us.

234
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,647
But how do we know
these dragons are just curiosities

235
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,803
and not the beasts
that brought the whole world to heel?

236
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,770
Because we have been told
as much by the many experts

237
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,808
who serve the realm by counseling the King

238
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,922
on matters about which he knows nothing.

239
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,321
But I haven't been counseled.

240
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,849
You are being counseled at this very moment.

241
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,884
I should be consulted about such things.

242
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,880
From now on, I will see to it that you are

243
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,566
appropriately consulted on important matters

244
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,170
whenever necessary.

245
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,721
Your Grace.

246
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,409
Yunkai. The Yellow City.

247
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,808
The Yunkish train
bed slaves, not soldiers. We can defeat them.

248
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,604
On the field, with ease.
But they won't meet us on the field.

249
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,968
They have provisions,
patience, and strong walls.

250
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,566
If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls

251
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,206
and chip away at us, man by man.

252
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,805
I don't want half my army killed

253
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,530
before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.

254
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,965
We don't need Yunkai, Khaleesi.

255
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,602
Taking this city will not bring you

256
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,927
any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne.

257
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,682
How many slaves are there in Yunkai?

258
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,530
200,000, if not more.

259
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,642
Then we have 200,000 reasons to take the city.

260
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,690
Send a man to the city gates.

261
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,163
Tell the slavers I will receive them here,
and accept their surrender.

262
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,566
Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer
the same fate as Astapor.

263
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,846
Now comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz

264
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,606
of that ancient and honorable house,

265
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,651
Master of Men and
Speaker to Savages, to offer terms of peace.

266
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,401
Noble lord, you are in the presence

267
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,961
of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen,

268
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,327
Queen of the Andals and the First Men,

269
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,761
Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea,

270
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,730
Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons.

271
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,125
You may approach. Sit.

272
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,802
Will
the noble lord take refreshment?

273
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,491
Ancient and glorious is Yunkai.

274
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,644
Our empire was old
before dragons stirred in old Valyria.

275
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,004
Many an army has broken against our walls.

276
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,890
You shall find
no easy conquest here, Khaleesi.

277
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,481
Good.

278
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,249
My Unsullied need
practice. I was told to blood them early.

279
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,006
If blood is your desire, blood shall flow.

280
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,401
But why?

281
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,602
'Tis true you have
committed savageries in Astapor,

282
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,127
but the Yunkai
are a forgiving and generous people.

283
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,280
The wise masters of
Yunkai have sent a gift for the Silver Queen.

284
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,647
There is far more than
this awaiting you on the deck of your ship.

285
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,762
- My ship?
- Yes, Khaleesi.

286
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,889
As I said, we are a generous people.

287
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,328
You shall have as many ships as you require.

288
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,363
And what do you ask in return?

289
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,843
All we ask
is that you make use of these ships.

290
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,491
Sail them back to Westeros where you belong,

291
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,171
and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace.

292
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,250
I have a gift for you as well.

293
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,601
Your life.

294
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,681
My life?

295
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,882
And the lives of your wise masters.

296
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,122
But I also want something in return.

297
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,720
You will release every slave in Yunkai.

298
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,564
Every man, woman, and child

299
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,247
shall be given as much
food, clothing, and property as they can carry

300
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,561
as payment for their years of servitude.

301
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,404
Reject this gift,
and I shall show you no mercy.

302
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,925
You are mad.

303
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:39,647
We are not Astapor or Qarth.
We are Yunkai, and we have powerful friends.

304
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,327
Friends who would
take great pleasure in destroying you.

305
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,324
Those who survive,
we shall enslave once more.

306
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,641
Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well.

307
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,529
- You swore me safe conduct.
- I did,

308
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,361
but my dragons made no promises.

309
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,249
And you threatened their mother.

310
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,001
Take the gold.

311
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,967
My gold. You gave it to me, remember?

312
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,367
And I shall put it to good use.

313
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,683
You'd be wise to do the same
with my gift to you.

314
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,091
Now get out.

315
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,247
The Yunkish are
a proud people. They will not bend.

316
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,970
And what happens to things that don't bend?

317
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,009
He said he had
powerful friends. Who was he talking about?

318
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,486
I don't know.

319
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,691
Find out.

320
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,531
Chains?

321
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,483
Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport.

322
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,843
Smithed in Casterly Rock.

323
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,165
Golden chains.

324
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,365
You could buy a ship with these.

325
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,962
- Do I need a ship?
- What?

326
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,644
Am I going somewhere?

327
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,444
Of course you're not going anywhere.

328
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,165
So, am I invited to your wedding?

329
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,128
I didn't ask for this marriage. I didn't want it.

330
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,921
No? She's a beautiful girl.
You said so yourself.

331
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,002
That doesn't mean that...

332
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,601
This is duty, not desire.

333
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,682
Is that what you
will tell yourself when you fuck her?

334
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,081
I don't have a choice. My father...

335
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,441
Does not rule the world.

336
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,442
We can still go across the Narrow Sea.

337
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,045
What would I do there?

338
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,806
Juggle?

339
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,609
I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.

340
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,364
And I'm Shae the funny whore.

341
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,289
My feelings for you have not changed.

342
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,169
I will marry Sansa Stark
and do my duty by her.

343
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,211
While I empty her chamber
pot and lick your cock when you're bored?

344
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,681
I swear to you, it will not be like that.

345
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,206
No? What will it be like?

346
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,203
I will buy you a good home
somewhere in the city.

347
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:22,604
You will have fine
clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants.

348
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,285
Any children we might have
will be well provided for.

349
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,283
Children? You think I want children

350
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,368
who can never see their father?

351
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,765
Who would be killed in their sleep

352
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,490
if their grandfather found out about them?

353
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,564
Listen. Listen to me, my lady.

354
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,006
I'm not your lady.

355
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,241
You are.

356
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,088
You'll always be my lady.

357
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,361
I'm your whore.

358
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,610
And when you are
tired of fucking me, I will be nothing.

359
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,122
- What happened?
- Wildfire.

360
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,803
I should have been here.

361
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,970
After all the running and fighting,

362
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,770
here I am, back where I started.

363
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,250
Do you miss it?

364
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,968
- King's Landing?
- Your father's house.

365
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,485
Never had a father. Never wanted one.

366
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,525
Haven't you ever
wondered where your strength came from?

367
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,970
Your talent for fighting?

368
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,601
I'm lowborn. As low as
can be. My mother was a tavern wench.

369
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,162
Mine was a slave. So was I.

370
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,851
Bought and sold, scourged and branded,

371
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,003
until the Lord of Light reached down,

372
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,003
took me in his hand, and raised me up.

373
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,606
I was born in Flea Bottom.

374
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,885
Your blood is noble.

375
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,730
Are you saying my father,
he was some lord or...

376
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,362
There. Your father's house.

377
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,681
I'm just a bastard.

378
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,487
The bastard of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

379
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,802
First of His Name,
King of the Andals and the First Men.

380
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,764
Why do you think
the gold cloaks wanted you?

381
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,047
There is power in a king's blood.

382
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,243
Come sit by the fire, child.

383
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,046
Not talking, eh? That's a first.

384
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,089
I don't talk to traitors.

385
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,921
I didn't like giving up the boy.

386
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,166
But you did.

387
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,767
You took the gold and you gave him up.

388
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,531
The Red God is
the one true god. You've seen his power.

389
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,489
When he commands, we obey.

390
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,131
He's not my one true god.

391
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,920
No? Who's yours?

392
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,650
Death.

393
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,050
Spotted a Lannister raiding party.

394
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,844
- How many?
- No more than 20.

395
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,160
How far?

396
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,611
Less than a day's ride south.

397
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,691
What do you say, boys? Time for a lion hunt?

398
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,250
Yeah!

399
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,641
But what about Riverrun?
It's not south. It's west of here.

400
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,609
It will still be west of here two days from now.

401
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,727
You swore.

402
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,809
To take you home, and I will.

403
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,925
But we need to do this first.

404
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,684
Why? So you can steal their gold?

405
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,450
I swear to you, this isn't...

406
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,050
I don't care what you swear

407
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,891
because you're a liar.
You lied to Gendry, you lied to me.

408
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,009
You'll lie to anyone.
I hope the Lannisters kill you all.

409
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,443
One day you'll understand, but now...

410
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,486
Anguy, bring her back.

411
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,840
Come back, girl!

412
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,204
Kick all you like, wolf girl.

413
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,409
Won't do you no good.

414
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,041
I thought you were gone.

415
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,525
Tomorrow.

416
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,080
Have they told you what
they plan to do with me?

417
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,361
Lord Bolton's traveling tomorrow as well.

418
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,885
He's going to the Twins
for Edmure Tully's wedding.

419
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,484
You're to remain here.

420
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,811
With Locke?

421
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,841
I owe you a debt.

422
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,562
When Catelyn Stark
released you, we both made a promise to her.

423
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,569
Now it's your promise.

424
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,650
You gave your word.

425
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,770
Keep it and consider the debt paid.

426
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,727
I will return the Stark girls to their mother.

427
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,091
I swear it.

428
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,969
Good-bye, Ser Jaime.

429
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,649
Here. Let me.

430
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,646
It will take time.

431
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,369
Qyburn hopes your father will force

432
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,289
the Citadel to give him back his chain.

433
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:24,160
My father will make him grand
maester if he grows me a new hand.

434
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,687
You will give my regards
to Lord Tywin, I trust?

435
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,849
Tell Robb Stark
I'm sorry I couldn't make his uncle's wedding.

436
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,844
The Lannisters send their regards.

437
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,003
Safe journey, Kingslayer.

438
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,361
Nothing to say?

439
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:51,130
I liked you better before.
I don't remember chopping your balls off, too.

440
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:57,691
Don't you worry about
your friend. We'll take good care of her.

441
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,045
Gentle, my lord.

442
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,003
Gentle.

443
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,208
Myranda knows what she's doing.

444
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,081
Let her.

445
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,608
She trained as a septa, only...

446
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,410
She had other urges.

447
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,527
So did the septons, only they lied about it.

448
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,685
Where is he?

449
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,171
Who, my lord?

450
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:21,921
There's no one here but you, me, and Violet.

451
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,445
Please.

452
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,764
Don't you want us to see it?

453
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,684
Oh, come on. Let us see it.

454
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,929
Everybody talks about it.

455
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,610
Who sent you?

456
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,530
Who sent us?

457
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,650
We sent ourselves,
Lord Greyjoy. We heard so much about it.

458
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,801
Please.

459
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,325
Oh!

460
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,845
There it is.

461
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,405
Oh...

462
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,885
Do you think we're ugly?

463
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,284
He thinks we're ugly.

464
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,164
Well, he's been through so much.

465
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,129
Look at his poor face.

466
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,247
Help me.

467
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,609
If he comes back...

468
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,049
We need to make him feel better.

469
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,651
And how can we make him feel better?

470
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,085
I have an idea.

471
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,601
AW!

472
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,450
She's shy.
You know how they are, these religious girls.

473
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,729
Maybe he doesn't know how we are.

474
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,568
I felt something.

475
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,401
Oh, Lord Greyjoy.

476
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,521
As good as they say?

477
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,601
Mmm.

478
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,722
And why should you get all the fun?

479
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,131
What? You like her better?

480
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,484
Plenty there for both of us.

481
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,845
I was here first.

482
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,130
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

483
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,444
Terrible timing.

484
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,922
But I was getting jealous.

485
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,130
Well?

486
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,443
Should we see this cock
everyone's always going on about?

487
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,285
Everyone knows you love girls.

488
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,163
I bet you always thought they loved you back.

489
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,167
Your famous cock must be
very precious to you.

490
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,483
Would you say it's your most precious part?

491
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,410
Please.

492
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:06,446
No. No! Mercy, please! Please, mercy! Mercy!

493
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,642
This is mercy.

494
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,570
I'm not killing you.

495
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,368
Just making a few alterations.

496
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:22,050
No! No! No! Please, no! No!

497
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,283
No! No, please! Please!

498
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,806
You're gonna scare it off.

499
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,401
I'm
not gonna scare it. I'm gonna kill it.

500
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,720
It's too far away.

501
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,611
Is that a palace?

502
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,485
It's a windmill.

503
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,005
Windmill.

504
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,561
Who built it? Some king?

505
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,563
Just the men who used to live here.

506
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,723
They must have
been great builders, stacking stones so high.

507
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,244
Winterfell has towers three times that size.

508
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,721
"Oh, I'm Jon Snow and I'm from Winterfell.

509
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,245
"My daddy was a fancy lord

510
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,926
"and I lived in a tower
that touched the clouds."

511
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,002
If you're impressed
by a windmill, you'd be swooning

512
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,606
if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell.

513
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,245
What's swooning?

514
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,045
Fainting.

515
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,325
What's fainting?

516
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,409
When a girl sees blood and collapses.

517
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,364
Why would a girl see blood and collapse?

518
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,561
Well...

519
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,245
Not all girls are like you.

520
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,922
Well, girls see more blood than boys.

521
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,045
Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow?

522
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,610
Oh, a spider! Save me, Jon Snow.

523
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:08,521
My dress is made
of the purest silk from Tralalalaleeday.

524
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,409
I'd like to see you in a silk dress.

525
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,400
Would you?

526
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,849
So I could tear it off you.

527
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:25,164
Well, you rip
my pretty silk dress, I'll blacken your eye.

528
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,689
Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.

529
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,001
Or maybe one day I'll take you there.

530
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,481
After we've taken our land back.

531
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,241
Ygritte.

532
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,125
You won't win.

533
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,562
I know your people are brave,
no one denies that.

534
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,130
You know nothing...

535
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,730
Six times in the last thousand years,

536
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,280
a King-beyond-the-Wall
has attacked the kingdoms.

537
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,930
Six times they failed.

538
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,610
And how do you know that?

539
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,287
Every boy in
the North knows it. We grow up learning it.

540
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,170
Where the battles
were fought, the heroes, who died where.

541
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:16,007
Six times you've invaded
and six times you've failed.

542
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,570
The seventh will be the same.

543
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,130
Mance is different.

544
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,770
You don't have the discipline.

545
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,367
You don't have the training.
Your army is no army.

546
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,647
You don't know how to fight together.

547
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,807
You don't know that.

548
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,120
I do.

549
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,450
I know it.

550
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,411
If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you.

551
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,484
All of us.

552
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,321
You're mine as I'm yours.

553
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,801
And if we die, we die.

554
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,730
But first we'll live.

555
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,091
Yes, first we'll live.

556
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,404
What's he going on about?

557
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,565
And how come he always gets to sit and
chat while we do all the work?

558
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,405
Hodor.

559
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,811
- That's where we are.
- What are you telling him?

560
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,443
- It's all right, Osha.
- It's not all right.

561
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,211
You think I can't hear you every day?

562
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,651
Filling his head with black magic.

563
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,045
Talking about visions
and three-eyed ravens and worse.

564
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,246
Leave him alone.

565
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,890
He can speak for himself.

566
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,930
I don't fill his head with anything.

567
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,764
So, what do you talk about?

568
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,330
What's happening to him
and what that means.

569
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,641
Go on, then. Tell us what it means.

570
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,570
It's not like that.

571
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,088
I wish I could tell
him all the answers. It would be much easier.

572
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,169
I don't want you talking to him anymore.

573
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,163
Until we get to your brother at Castle Black.

574
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,645
We're not going to Castle Black.

575
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,125
What did you say?

576
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,881
I told you already. Jon Snow isn't there.

577
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,480
Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.

578
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,846
Oh, no. I'm not going back there.

579
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,844
Your brother is
at Castle Black. That's where we're going.

580
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,804
Look at me.

581
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,405
The raven's been coming
to me ever since I fell from that tower.

582
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,562
He wants me to find him.

583
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,801
I don't have my legs anymore.

584
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,610
This is what I have now.

585
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,765
You have a family.
You need to go back to Castle Black

586
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,446
so you can get back to
them, where you belong.

587
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,443
What if I belong in the North?

588
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:05,770
What if I fell from that tower for a reason?

589
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,842
Is that what he's
telling you? That it's all for a reason?

590
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,525
All these bad things happened because the
Gods got big plans for you?

591
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,480
I wish it were true, little lord.

592
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,610
But the Gods wouldn't spare
a raven's cold shit for you or me or anyone.

593
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,967
You don't understand. You don't know.

594
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,008
You don't know. None of you know.

595
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,088
None of you have been up there.

596
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:34,445
I had a man once. A good man.

597
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,849
Bruni, his name was.
I was his and he was mine.

598
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,884
But one night Bruni disappears.

599
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,487
People said he left me, but I knew him.

600
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,042
He'd never leave me. Not for long.

601
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,690
I knew he'd come back.

602
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,726
And he did.

603
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,564
He came in through the back of the hut.

604
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,367
Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really.

605
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:12,285
His skin was pale like a dead man's.

606
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,886
His eyes bluer than clear sky.

607
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:26,609
He came at me,
grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard

608
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,081
I could feel the life slipping out of me.

609
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,530
I don't know how I got the knife.

610
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:39,366
When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart.

611
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,168
And he hardly seemed to notice.

612
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,126
I had to burn our hut down with him inside.

613
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,645
I didn't ask the Gods what it meant.

614
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,491
I didn't need to. I already knew.

615
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:05,481
It meant the North was
no place for men to be. Not anymore.

616
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,725
I promised your maester
I'd get you to Castle Black and no further.

617
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,930
How is the pain, my lord?

618
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,004
What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?

619
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,851
Well, we've stymied the corruption.

620
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,843
Yes, we've stymied the corruption.

621
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,330
You're a learned man.

622
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,250
All the good it's done me.

623
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,209
You did well sewing up this mess.

624
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:49,530
You're far better at this sort of
work than Grand Maester Pycelle.

625
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,769
Faint praise, my lord.

626
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,526
So, why did the Citadel take your chain?

627
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,123
Did you fondle one boy too many?

628
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,124
No, my lord. That's not my weakness.

629
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,445
What is?

630
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,085
Curiosity.

631
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,482
The only way to treat disease
is to understand disease,

632
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,329
and the only way
to understand it is to study the afflicted.

633
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,208
You performed experiments on living men.

634
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,282
- On dying men.
- With their permission?

635
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:27,843
My studies have
given me insight that has saved many lives.

636
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:32,926
Dying paupers, I assume.
Men with no families to complain.

637
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,448
You found them moaning in the poorhouse

638
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,722
and had them carted back to your garret

639
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,768
and opened up their bellies
to see what was inside.

640
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,689
How many men have you killed, my lord?

641
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,730
- I don't know.
- 50?

642
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,085
100?

643
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,047
Countless.

644
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,844
"Countless" has a nice ring to it.

645
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,684
And how many lives have you saved?

646
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,085
Half a million.

647
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,289
The population of King's Landing.

648
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,446
You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal.

649
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,370
Did you... Did you
get a bird off to Brienne's father in Tarth?

650
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,284
A bird flew off and a bird flew back.

651
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,681
Lord Selwyn Tarth

652
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:26,731
offered 300 gold dragons
for his daughter's safe return.

653
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,165
A fair offer.

654
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,049
A fair offer. Locke won't take it.

655
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:32,961
Why not?

656
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,922
He's convinced Lord Tarth
owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.

657
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,129
He feels he's being cheated.

658
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,043
They'd be fools to kill her.

659
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,282
These men have been at war a long time.

660
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,607
Most of them will be dead by winter.

661
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,411
She'll be their entertainment tonight.

662
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,971
Beyond tonight,
I don't think they care very much.

663
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,009
We have to return to Harrenhal.

664
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,362
- Why?
- I've left something behind.

665
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,922
Absolutely not.
I've got orders from Lord Bolton.

666
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,809
And what are those orders?

667
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,645
To deliver you
to your father at King's Landing.

668
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,330
You think you'll get a reward.

669
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,365
I serve Lord Bolton.

670
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,966
Any appreciation your father...

671
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,320
You think you're getting a reward.

672
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,165
Let me explain
something to you. When my father sees me,

673
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,164
the first thing he's going to
ask is what happened to my hand,

674
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:48,210
and I'm going to tell him
this man chopped it off.

675
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,089
I had nothing...

676
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,043
Or I could tell him this man saved my life.

677
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,362
We return to Harrenhal. Now.

678
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,569
- Eyes open, lads.
- Be quiet.

679
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:29,331
The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair

680
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,530
From there to here, from here to there

681
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,807
All black and brown and covered in hair

682
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,002
He smelled that girl in the summer air

683
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,481
The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair

684
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,770
Don't spare her.

685
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,684
Don't spare her!

686
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,489
Well, this is one shameful
fucking performance.

687
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,130
Stop running and fight.

688
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,566
A wooden sword?

689
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,805
I thought you'd gone.

690
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,331
You gave her a wooden sword!

691
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,886
We've only got one bear.

692
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,331
I'll pay her bloody ransom.

693
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,604
Gold, sapphires,
whatever you want. Just get her out of there.

694
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,806
All you lords and ladies still think that

695
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,531
the only thing that matters is gold.

696
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,130
This makes me happier
than all your gold ever could.

697
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,041
And that makes me happier
than all her sapphires.

698
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:31,047
So go buy yourself a golden
hand and fuck yourself with it!

699
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,610
- Get behind me.
- I will not.

700
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,887
What the fuck are you doing to my bear?

701
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,282
Lord Bolton charged me with bringing him
back to King's Landing alive,

702
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,920
and that's what I aim to do.

703
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,281
Pull her up!

704
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,521
Hold my legs.

705
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,850
Pull him up!

706
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,248
The bitch stays.

707
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:13,527
We're taking her
to King's Landing. Unless you kill me.

708
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,765
She belongs to me.

709
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,641
Lord Bolton's orders.

710
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,530
What do you
think is more important to Lord Bolton?

711
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,245
Getting his pet rat a reward

712
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:28,608
or ensuring Tywin Lannister
gets his son back alive?

713
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,760
Well, we must be on our way.

714
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,449
Sorry about the sapphires.

1
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,166
I'll give you one try, girl.

2
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,928
Kill me and you're free.

3
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,449
But if I live, I'll break both your hands.

4
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,803
Go on, hit me.

5
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,245
Hit me hard.

6
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,521
Sulk all you want.

7
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,040
The truth is, you're lucky.

8
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,286
You don't want to be alone out here, girl.

9
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,966
Someone worse than me would find you.

10
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,845
There's no one worse than you.

11
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,281
You never knew my brother.

12
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,721
He once killed a man for snoring.

13
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,202
There's plenty worse than me.

14
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,888
There's men who like to beat little
girls, men who like to rape them.

15
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,645
I saved your sister from some of them.

16
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,291
You're lying.

17
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,203
Ask her, if you ever see her again.

18
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,649
Ask her who came back
for her when the mob had her on her back.

19
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,001
They would have taken her every which way

20
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,487
and left her there with her throat cut open.

21
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,486
Is that the Blackwater?

22
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,364
The Blackwater?

23
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,208
Where do you think I'm taking you?

24
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,289
Back to King's Landing,
to Joffrey and the Queen.

25
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,931
Fuck Joffrey. Fuck the Queen.

26
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,130
That's the Red Fork.
I'm taking you to the Twins.

27
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,285
But why?

28
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,368
Your mother and brother will be
there, and they'll pay me for you.

29
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,682
Why would they be at the Twins?

30
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,044
Those outlaws
you love so much never told you?

31
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,964
The whole countryside is yapping about it.

32
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,684
Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls.

33
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,242
So quit trying to bash my skull in,

34
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,370
and we might
just make it there in time for the wedding.

35
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,041
Men who fight for gold
have neither honor nor loyalty.

36
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,324
They cannot be trusted.

37
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,841
They can be
trusted to kill you if they're well paid.

38
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,082
The Yunkish are paying them well.

39
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,889
You know these men?

40
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,049
Only by the broken swords on their banners.

41
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,685
They're called the Second Sons.

42
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,800
A company led by
a Braavosi named Mero, the Titan's Bastard.

43
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,681
Is he more titan or bastard?

44
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,560
He's a dangerous man, Khaleesi. They all are.

45
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,406
How many?

46
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,406
2,000, Your Grace.
Armored and mounted.

47
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,489
Enough to make a difference?

48
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,490
It's hard to collect wages from a corpse.

49
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,171
I'm sure the sellswords
prefer to fight for the winning side.

50
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,410
I imagine you're right.

51
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,728
I'd like to talk
to the Titan's Bastard about winning.

52
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,768
He may not agree to meet.

53
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,205
He Will.

54
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,120
A man who fights
for gold can't afford to lose to a girl.

55
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,282
Your Grace, allow me to present

56
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,482
the captains of the Second Sons,

57
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,609
Mero of Braavos,

58
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,602
Prendahl na Ghezn,

59
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,930
and, um...

60
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,282
Daario Naharis.

61
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,690
You are the Mother of Dragons?

62
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,881
I swear I fucked you once
in a pleasure house in Lys.

63
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,121
Mind your tongue.

64
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,520
Why?

65
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,681
I didn't mind hers.

66
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,726
She licked my ass like she was born to do it.

67
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,327
You, slave girl, bring wine.

68
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,646
We have no slaves here.

69
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,926
You'll all be
slaves after the battle, unless I save you.

70
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,406
Take your clothes off
and come and sit on Mero's lap,

71
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,164
and I may give you my Second Sons.

72
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,766
Give me your Second Sons
and I may not have you gelded.

73
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,287
Ser Barristan,
how many men fight for the Second Sons?

74
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,567
Under 2,000, Your Grace.

75
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,762
We have more, don't we?

76
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,808
10,000 Unsullied.

77
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,008
I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war,

78
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,242
but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself

79
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,887
can explain to me
how you propose to defeat us.

80
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,566
I hope the old man
is better with a sword than he is with a lie.

81
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,884
You have 8,000 Unsullied.

82
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,370
You're very young to be a captain.

83
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,125
He's not a captain. He's a lieutenant.

84
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,849
Even if your numbers are right,

85
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,963
the odds don't favor your side.

86
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,122
The Second Sons have
faced worse odds and won.

87
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,646
The Second Sons have
faced worse odds and run.

88
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,965
Or you could fight for me.

89
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,806
We've taken
the slavers' gold. We fight for Yunkai.

90
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,646
I would pay you
as much and more.

91
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,243
Our contract is our bond.

92
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,046
If we break our bond,
no one will hire the Second Sons again.

93
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,363
Ride with me
and you'll never need another contract.

94
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,364
You'll have gold and
castles and lordships of your choosing

95
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,329
when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.

96
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,243
You have no ships.
You have no siege weapons.

97
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,170
You have no cavalry.

98
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,242
A fortnight ago, I had
no army. A year ago, I had no dragons.

99
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,924
You have two days to decide.

100
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,161
Show me your cunt. I want to see

101
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,366
if it's worth fighting for.

102
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,243
My Queen, shall I slice out
his tongue for you?

103
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,769
These men are our guests.

104
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,525
You seem to be enjoying my wine.

105
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,967
Perhaps you'd like a flagon
to help you ponder.

106
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,045
Only a flagon?
And what are my brothers in arms to drink?

107
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,168
- A barrel, then.
- Good.

108
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,524
The Titan's Bastard does not drink alone.

109
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,808
In the Second Sons, we share everything.

110
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,122
After the battle, maybe we'll all share you.

111
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,769
I'll come looking for you when this is over.

112
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,207
Ser Barristan,
if it comes to battle, kill that one first.

113
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,642
Gladly, Your Grace.

114
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,007
Half Robert, half lowborn.

115
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,411
Show the boy to his chambers.

116
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,451
Have the maids draw him
a bath and find him some decent clothes.

117
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,926
I'll come visit you soon.

118
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,126
What do you mean to do with him?

119
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,480
You know.

120
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,291
Then why bathe him
and dress him in fine clothes?

121
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,966
If it needs to be
done, do it. Don't torture the boy.

122
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,566
Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?

123
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,207
No.

124
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,811
If the lamb sees the knife, she panics.

125
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,724
Her panic seeps into
her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor.

126
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,321
You've slaughtered many lambs?

127
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,408
And none have seen the blade.

128
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,327
"And though

129
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,444
"Visenya

130
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,965

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,564

133
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,844
"Vhag..."

134
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,331
Fuck me.

135
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,409
"Visenya Targaryen

136
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,728

"enough

141
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,761
"to swallow a horse whole."

142
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,371
Your Grace.

143
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,043
They feeding you enough?

144
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,610
Two meals a day.

145
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,730
Cold for breakfast,
hot for supper. I cannot complain.

146
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,328
You don't belong in a place like this.

147
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,290
Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse.

148
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,760
Yeah.

149
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,843
I'm sorry about your son.

150
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,448
Didn't get the chance to tell you before.

151
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,207
Good lad. Loyal lad.

152
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,002
Melisandre's returned.

153
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,448
I didn't know she'd been gone.

154
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,841
Came back with a bastard boy.

155
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,644
Robert's bastard boy.

156
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,846
Why?

157
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,526
She says there's power in king's blood.

158
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,326
She's going to kill him.

159
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,601
Sacrifice him.

160
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,762
Forgive me, Your Grace,
I'm not a learned man,

161
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,081
but is there a difference
between kill and sacrifice?

162
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,691
The boy is your nephew.

163
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,922
What of it? We're at war.

164
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,005
Why should I spare the son
of some tavern slut

165
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,726
Robert bedded one drunken night?

166
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,009
Because he has your blood in his veins.

167
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,726
So did Renly.

168
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,290
Renly wronged you.

169
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,971
Renly declared himself
king when the throne belonged to you.

170
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,691
He raised an army, stole your bannermen.

171
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,890
This boy has done you no harm.

172
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,200
He's an innocent.

173
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,600
How many boys live in Westeros?

174
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,970
How many girls?
How many men? How many women?

175
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,567
The darkness will devour them all, she
says. The night that never ends.

176
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,767
Unless I triumph. I never asked for this.

177
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,569
No more than I asked to be king.

178
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,245
We do not choose our destiny,
but we must do our duty, no?

179
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,127
Great or small, we must do our duty.

180
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,408
What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?

181
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,084
Your Grace,
why did you come to see me today?

182
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,724
I came to free you.

183
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,562
If you swear never to raise your hand
to the Lady Melisandre again.

184
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,771
I swear it.

185
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,604
I can't swear never to speak against her.

186
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,128
You have little regard for your own life.

187
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,244
Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none.

188
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,964
You could have
freed me yesterday or tomorrow,

189
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,046
but you came to me now
before this boy is put to the knife

190
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,806
because you knew I'd counsel restraint.

191
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,728
You came to hear me
say it because you believe it yourself.

192
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,088
You're not a man who
slaughters innocents for gain or glory.

193
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,800
When my son was five, he said to me,

194
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,688
"I don't ever want to die."

195
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,367
I wanted to say to him,
"You won't, child. You won't ever."

196
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,890
I hated the idea
of him lying awake in the dark, afraid.

197
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,643
I think mothers and fathers made up the Gods

198
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,645
because they wanted their
children to sleep through the night.

199
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,247
I saw a vision in the flames.

200
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,845
A great battle in the snow. I saw it.

201
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,161
And you saw whatever she gave birth to.

202
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,570
I never believed, but when you see the truth,

203
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,650
when it's right there in front of you,

204
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,806
as real as these iron bars,
how can you deny her god is real?

205
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,761
That dragon bitch. She talks too much.

206
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,490
You talk too much.

207
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,046
She won't talk so much
when she's choking on my cock.

208
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,726
8,000 Unsullied stand
between her and your cock.

209
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,281
My cock will find a way. Tell him.

210
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,922
Is there any place that my cock can't reach?

211
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,287
She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.

212
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,682
Daario Naharis, the whore
who doesn't like whores.

213
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,730
I like them very much.
I just refuse to pay them.

214
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,327
And I'm no whore, my friend.

215
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,968
She sells her sheath, and you sell your blade.

216
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,088
- What's the difference?
- I fight for beauty.

217
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,003
For beauty?

218
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,650
We fight for gold.

219
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,770
The Gods gave men
two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die,

220
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,165
the thrill of fucking
a woman who wants to be fucked

221
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,403
and the thrill
of killing a man who wants to kill you.

222
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,886
You'll die young.

223
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,530
What do we do
about the dragon girl?

224
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,807
We can't beat 8,000 Unsullied
on the battlefield.

225
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,090
There won't be a battle,
and we don't have to deal with her eunuchs.

226
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,730
We only have to deal with her.

227
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,961
She's well guarded.

228
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,320
Tonight's a new moon.

229
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,405
One of us slips into
her camp past her Unsullied and her knights.

230
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,924
Which one of us?

231
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,321
Close your eyes, love.

232
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,966
Three coins.

233
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,844
A coin from Meereen,

234
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,009
a coin from Volantis,

235
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,681
and a coin from Braavos.

236
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,410
The Braavosi does the deed.

237
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,321
One for each of us, darling.

238
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,411
No peeking.

239
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,886
Do you hear me?

240
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,166
Follow my voice. I'm right here.

241
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,482
You have something for me?

242
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,684
Valar Morghulis.

243
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,686
Lady Sansa.

244
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,924
You look very handsome, my lord.

245
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,280
Oh, yes.

246
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,567
The husband of your dreams.
But you do look glorious.

247
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,249
Perhaps we could
have a moment alone. Do you mind?

248
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,567
Podrick, could you escort
Lady Stark's handmaiden?

249
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,847
My lady, I want you to know

250
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,609
I didn't ask for this.

251
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,328
I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord.

252
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,731
No, don't.

253
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,485
You don't have to
speak to me as a prisoner anymore.

254
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,087
You won't be
a prisoner after today. You'll be my wife.

255
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,928
I suppose that's a different kind of prison.

256
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,003
I just wanted to say...

257
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,529
I'm just trying to say, very badly...

258
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,411
I just...

259
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,001
Just want to say I know how you feel.

260
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,926
I doubt that very much, my lord.

261
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,888
You're right. I have no idea how you feel.

262
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,446
And you have no idea how I feel.

263
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,768
But I promise you
one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you.

264
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,210
Do you drink wine?

265
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,165
When I have to.

266
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,762
Well, today you have to.

267
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,848
You look radiant, Your Grace.

268
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,569
Radiant? Why radiant?

269
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,721
It's the word that came to mind.

270
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,361
We're going to
be sisters soon. We should be friends.

271
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,606
You're a musical girl, aren't you?

272
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,206
I imagine you have a lovely voice.

273
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,206
A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid.

274
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,130
But you know the song
The Rains of Castamere?

275
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,363
Of course. They play it so often here at court.

276
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,484
So you know the story
of House Reyne of Castamere?

277
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,607
Not as well as you, I'm sure.

278
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,483
House Reyne was
a powerful family. Very wealthy.

279
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,847
The second wealthiest in Westeros.

280
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,645
Aren't the Tyrells the second
wealthiest family in Westeros now?

281
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:14,006
Ambitious climbers don't want to
stop on the second highest rung.

282
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,921
If only you could take that final step,

283
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,361
you'd see further than all the rest.

284
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,841
You'd be alone with nothing
but blue sky above you.

285
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,970
So Lord Reyne built a castle
as grand as Casterly Rock.

286
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,886
He gave his wife diamonds
larger than any my mother ever wore.

287
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,889
And finally one day,
he rebelled against my father.

288
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,761
Do you know where House Reyne is now?

289
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,921
Gone.

290
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,001
Gone.

291
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,407
A gentle word. Why not say "slaughtered"?

292
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,208
Every man, woman, and
child put to the sword.

293
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,287
I remember seeing their bodies hanging

294
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,641
high above the gates of Casterly Rock.

295
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,248
My father let them rot up there
all summer. It was a long summer.

296
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:09,690
"And now the rains
weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear."

297
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,602
If you ever call me "sister" again,

298
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,848
I'll have you strangled in your sleep.

299
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,526
What are you doing?

300
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,811
Your father's gone.

301
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,411
As the father of the realm, it is my duty

302
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,131
to give you away to your husband.

303
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:28,410
You may now cloak
the bride and bring her under your protection.

304
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,081
Uh...

305
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,605
Could you...

306
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,601
Thank you.

307
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,930
Your Grace, Your Grace, my lords, my ladies,

308
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,649
we stand here in the sight of gods and men

309
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,843
to witness the union of man and wife.

310
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,445
One flesh,
one heart, one soul, now and forever.

311
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,161
Have you ever seen one like it?

312
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,885
I've never seen
anything like any of this. Not in my life.

313
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,806
It's shocking, isn't it,
the first time you encounter real wealth?

314
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,802
When I was your age,
I lived on one bowl of stew a day.

315
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,451
And stew is a kind word for it.

316
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,524
In Flea Bottom
we called them "bowls of brown."

317
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,329
We'd pretend that
the meat in them was chicken.

318
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,207
We knew it wasn't chicken.

319
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,164
Here, taste this.

320
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,889
You think I'm trying to poison you?

321
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,726
That's good.

322
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,086
That's really good.

323
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,208
Where do you think it's from?

324
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,041
I couldn't even guess.

325
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,091
Doesn't matter, does it?
It's the real thing or it's not.

326
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,047
You only need a tongue to tell the difference.

327
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,404
Go on, have some more.

328
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,731
You still don't trust it.

329
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,404
You think this is all a mistake

330
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,807
and that you have to pay
for every bite you take.

331
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,929
That thought had
crossed my mind, yeah.

332
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,246
There are no mistakes.

333
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,851
Not for us.

334
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,285
I'm a mistake.

335
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,129
I'm only here because
my father grabbed my mother

336
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,168
instead of the girl next to her in the tavern.

337
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,165
Your father chose your
mother because the Lord of Light willed it.

338
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,766
He willed it so you could be here right now

339
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,845
with a power inside you
you can't even begin to understand.

340
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,924
And He brought me here
to draw it from you and birth it into the world.

341
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,567
We're both a part of His plan.

342
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,491
He wants this for us.
No, He demands this of us.

343
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,842
I don't understand. This...

344
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,124
This doesn't seem very religious.

345
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,450
According to whom?

346
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,011
The Silent Sisters?

347
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,803
With their stern looks,
muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts?

348
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,326
What have their gods done for you?

349
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,801
Mmm?

350
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,930
When you pray to them, what's their answer?

351
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,960
A god is real or he's not.

352
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,681
You only need eyes to see.

353
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,530
Death is coming for everyone and everything.

354
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,564
A darkness that will swallow the dawn.

355
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,650
And we can stop it, you and I.

356
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,043
Let me show you what you have inside you.

357
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,649
Come fight death with me.

358
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,169
What are you doing?

359
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,209
You have to trust me.

360
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,287
What...

361
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,450
Get it away.

362
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,966
Get it off me.

363
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,520
Don't fight, don't fight. They won't take much.

364
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,564
Why are you doing this?

365
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,762
I told you there's power in the blood of kings.

366
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,684
And you have so much blood.

367
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,121
No.

368
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,601
No, no, no, no!

369
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,209
Not there. Not there!

370
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:15,127
You can blame Ser Davos.
He didn't believe in the power of king's blood.

371
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,408
He wanted a demonstration.

372
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,486
Please. Please, Your Grace.

373
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,565
My lord!

374
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,248
The usurper Robb Stark.

375
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,042
The usurper Balon Greyjoy.

376
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,131
The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

377
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,611
So their son will be your nephew.

378
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,048
After you're wed to Cersei, of course.

379
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,886
And you will be
the King's stepfather and brother-in-law.

380
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:52,685
When you marry the King,
Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law

381
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,481
and your son will be Loras' nephew?

382
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,890
Grandson? I'm not sure.

383
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,131
But your brother
will become your father-in-law.

384
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,288
That much is beyond dispute.

385
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,368
Will you pardon me, my lord?

386
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,602
Of course. Of course. Enjoy.

387
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,487
Perhaps you could
talk to your bride-to-be instead.

388
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,807
I've got a lifetime for that.

389
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,800
Stay.

390
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,084
You seem rather drunk.

391
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,131
Rather less than I plan to be.

392
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,687
Isn't it a man's duty to be
drunk at his own wedding?

393
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,890
This isn't about your
wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding.

394
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:24,360
Your wife needs a child,
a Lannister child, as soon as possible.

395
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,601
And?

396
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,767
If you're going to give her one,

397
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,968
you need to perform.

398
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,162
What did you once call me?

399
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,482
A drunken little lust-filled beast.

400
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,843
- More than once.
- There you have it.

401
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,849
Nothing to worry about.

402
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:43,921
Drinking and lust,
no man can match me in these things.

403
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,685
I am the god of tits and wine.

404
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:52,566
I shall build a shrine
to myself at the next brothel I visit.

405
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,446
You can drink, you can joke,

406
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,409
you can engage in juvenile attempts

407
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,409
to make your father uncomfortable,

408
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,211
but you will do your duty.

409
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,721
Well...

410
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,042
My father once told me...

411
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,322
Nobody cares what your father once told you.

412
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,125
Congratulations, my lady.

413
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,844
Thank you, Your Grace.

414
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,685
Well, you've done it.
You've married a Lannister.

415
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,161
Soon you'll have a Lannister baby.

416
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,971
It's a dream come true for you, isn't it?

417
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,730
What a glorious day.

418
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,046
Yes, Your Grace.

419
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,600
I suppose it doesn't really matter

420
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,286
which Lannister puts the baby into you.

421
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,603
Maybe I'll pay
you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out.

422
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,929
How'd you like that?

423
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,810
You wouldn't?

424
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,566
That's all right.
Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down.

425
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,164
Time for the bedding ceremony.

426
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,401
Ah!

427
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,369
There will be no bedding ceremony.

428
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,125
Where's your respect for tradition, Uncle?

429
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,006
Come, everyone.
Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed.

430
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,649
Get rid of her gown.
She won't be needing it any longer.

431
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,564
Ladies, attend to my uncle. He's not heavy.

432
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,449
There will be no bedding ceremony.

433
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,488
There will be if I command it.

434
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,163
Then you'll be
fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.

435
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,284
What did you say?

436
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,965
What did you say?

437
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,368
I believe we can
dispense with the bedding, Your Grace.

438
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,848
I'm sure Tyrion did not mean
to threaten the King.

439
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,523
A bad joke, Your Grace.

440
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,528
Made out of envy of your own royal manhood.

441
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,162
Mine is so small.

442
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,684
My poor wife won't even know I'm there.

443
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,650
Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace.

444
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,166
I am.

445
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,966
Guilty.

446
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,840
But...

447
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,729
But it is my wedding night.

448
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,046
My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do.

449
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,725
Come, wife.

450
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,002
I vomited on a girl once
in the middle of the act.

451
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,650
Not proud of it.

452
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,924
But I think honesty is important

453
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,970
between a man and wife, don't you agree?

454
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,721
Come, I'll tell you
all about it. Put you in the mood.

455
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,362
Is that wise, my lord?

456
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,965
Tyrion, Sansa.

457
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,964
My name is Tyrion.

458
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,969
Is that wise, Tyrion?

459
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,083
Nothing was ever wiser.

460
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,440
Astoundingly long.

461
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,801
What?

462
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,161
Neck.

463
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,250
You have one.

464
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,640
How old are you exactly?

465
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,000
14.

466
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,846
Well, talk won't make you any older.

467
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:26,369
My lord father has
commanded me to consummate this marriage.

468
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,121
Stop.

469
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,200
I can't.

470
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,244
I could, I won't.

471
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,407
But your father...

472
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:02,168
If my father wants someone to get
fucked, I know where he can start.

473
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,444
I won't share your bed.

474
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,962
Not until you want me to.

475
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,007
What if I never want you to?

476
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,328
And so my watch begins.

477
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,040
Nineteen?

478
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,406
Yes, Your Grace.

479
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,882
How can anyone speak 19 languages?

480
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,089
It only took Your Grace
a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well.

481
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,527
Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki

482
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,121
or grunt at my husband and hope...

483
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,723
What do you mean, "reasonably well"?

484
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,370
Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master.

485
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,291
So guttural and harsh.

486
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,121
Drogo said I spoke Dothraki
like one born to it.

487
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,567
It gave him great pride.

488
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,241
Athjahakar.

489
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,243
Athjahaka.

490
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,727
Ath-ja-hakar.

491
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,403
Athjahakar.

492
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,490
Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice.

493
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,770
Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace.

494
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,289
The Gods could not devise
a more perfect tongue.

495
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,250
It is the only proper language for poetry.

496
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,762
No screaming, or she dies.

497
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,086
What do you want?

498
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,206
You.

499
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,850
Let her go.

500
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,962
Don't scream, lovely girl.

501
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,245
You were sent here to kill me?

502
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,689
So why haven't you?

503
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,641
I don't want to.

504
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,962
What do your captains
have to say about that?

505
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,804
You should ask them.

506
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,647
Why?

507
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,122
We had philosophical differences.

508
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,605
Over what?

509
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,801
Your beauty.

510
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,051
It meant more to me than it did to them.

511
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,565
You're a strange man.

512
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,247
I'm the simplest man
you'll ever meet. I only do what I want to do.

513
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,209
And this is supposed to impress me?

514
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,241
Yes.

515
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,164
Why would I trust a man
who murders his comrades?

516
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,089
They ordered me to murder you.

517
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,766
I told them I preferred not to.

518
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,241
They told me I had no choice.

519
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:56,530
I told them
I am Daario Naharis. I always have a choice.

520
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:03,003
They drew their swords and I drew mine.

521
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,289
Will you fight for me?

522
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,051
Swear to me.

523
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,289
The Second Sons are yours,
and so is Daario Naharis.

524
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:56,442
My sword is yours,
my life is yours, my heart is yours.

525
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,327
You really ought to knock.

526
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,448
I brought your breakfast.

527
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:41,206
It's getting dark.
We could stay here for the night.

528
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,807
How hard can it be to build a fire?

529
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:22,606
It doesn't matter. Come under the
furs. We can keep each other warm.

530
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,369
He winked at me before.

531
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,204
I doubt it.

532
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,924
I saw him wink at me.

533
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,366
He blinked.

534
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,487
I suppose it's a rather
philosophical difference

535
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,562
between a wink and a blink.

536
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,926
A what?

537
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,601
Well, I mean, there's no real difference.

538
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,569
A wink is on purpose.

539
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,445
You thought of a name yet?

540
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,481
It would be easier
to refer to him if he had a name.

541
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,807
Sometimes do you talk fancy
on purpose to confuse me?

542
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,808
What? No.

543
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,284
This is just the way I talk.

544
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,283
I'll build that fire.

545
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,565
Don't you think he should have a name?

546
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,122
I don't know many boys' names.

547
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,124
Let's see, there's Duncan,

548
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,164
Kevan, Jon...

549
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,563
Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer.

550
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,766
Craster.

551
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,563
Uh... Yes.

552
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,727
Maybe that's not...

553
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,966
Mormont.

554
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,485
That's a lovely idea,
but Mormont's a last name.

555
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,163
Why is it a last name?

556
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,841
Well, it's a family name.

557
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,607
For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly.

558
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:29,882
Samwell is my birth name
and Tarly is my family name.

559
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,683
You see? So my father is also a Tarly.

560
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,563
His name is Samwell Tarly, too?

561
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,251
No, Randyll Tarly.

562
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,688
Randyll is a handsome name.

563
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,565
Please don't name him Randyll.

564
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,924
Is your father cruel, like mine?

565
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,648
Different manner of cruel.

566
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,211
Not Randyll, then.

567
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,527
Don't.

568
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,529
Don't go out there.

569
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:45,207
I'll be back. I just want to look.

570
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,411
Go inside.

571
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,411
Go back inside. I'll...

572
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,646
It's come for the baby.

573
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,001
Stay back!

574
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,246
You stay back!

575
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,563
No, you can't have him! No!

576
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,646
No!

1
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,644
Are you
sure about this?

2
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,445
No.

3
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,689
It's dangerous.

4
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,085
If we take Tywin's castle from him,

5
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,443
the lords of Westeros
will realize he's not invincible.

6
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,923
Take his home, take his gold, take his power.

7
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,288
Why are you telling me?

8
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,844
You begged me not to send Theon

9
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,686
to negotiate with his father,
and I ignored your advice.

10
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,001
Now Winterfell is burnt to the ground,

11
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,085
the North is overrun
with ironborn, and Bran and Rickon are gone.

12
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,725
So, Casterly Rock...

13
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,930
I'm asking your advice.

14
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,926
We have enough men?

15
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,251
If Walder Frey cooperates.

16
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,724
If reinforcements arrive from King's
Landing before we take the castle,

17
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,840
we'll be caught between
Tywin's army and the sea.

18
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,570
We'll lose the war and die the way Father died.

19
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,369
Or worse.

20
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,562
Show them how it feels to lose what they love.

21
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,011
My honored guests,

22
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,291
be welcome within my walls and at my table.

23
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,126
I extend to you my hospitality

24
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,046
and protection in the light of the Seven.

25
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,521
We thank you for your hospitality, my lord.

26
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,528
I have come to make my apologies, my
lord, and to beg your forgiveness.

27
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,043
Don't beg my forgiveness, Your Grace.

28
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,363
It wasn't me you spurned. It was my girls.

29
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,406
One of them was supposed to be queen.

30
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,005
Now none of them are.

31
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,162
This is Arwyn, my daughter.

32
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,848
My daughter Walda, my daughter Derwa,

33
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,446
my daughter Waldra.

34
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,091
My eldest granddaughters Ginia and Neila.

35
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,170
Serra and Sarra, granddaughters, twins.

36
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,969
You could have had either.

37
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,206
Could have had both, for all I care.

38
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,608
My granddaughter Marianne.

39
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,687
My granddaughter Freya.

40
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,484
My granddaughter...

41
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,847
Wertha.

42
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,846
Waldra.

43
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,331
Waldina.

44
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,527
I'm Merry.

45
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,329
Fine.

46
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,041
And here's my youngest daughter Shirei,

47
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,930
though she hasn't bled yet.

48
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,602
Clearly you don't have
the patience for all that.

49
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,811
My ladies.

50
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,169
All men should
keep their word, kings most of all.

51
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,849
I was pledged to
marry one of you and I broke that vow.

52
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,002
The fault is not with you.

53
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,367
Any man would be lucky
to have any one of you.

54
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,402
I did what I did
not to slight you, but because I loved another.

55
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,323
I know these words cannot set right

56
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,283
the wrong I have done to you and your house.

57
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,770
I beg your forgiveness

58
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,170
and pledge to do all I can to make
amends so the Freys of the Crossing

59
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,720
and the Starks of Winterfell
may once again be friends.

60
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,003
Very good.

61
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,446
There she is.

62
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,051
Come closer. Let me have a look at you.

63
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,604
Still can't see you.

64
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,210
Old eyes.

65
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,443
Love.

66
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,121
That's what the Starks of Winterfell call it, eh?

67
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,486
Very honorable. I call it a pretty face.

68
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,607
Mmm.

69
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,687
Very pretty.

70
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,848
Prettier than this lot, that's for sure.

71
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,449
Very shapely as well.

72
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,290
Oh, you try to hide her under that dress.

73
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,086
If you wanted to hide her,

74
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,447
you shouldn't have
brought her here in the first place.

75
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,324
I can always see
what's going on beneath a dress.

76
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,768
Been at this a long time.

77
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,171
I bet when you take that dress off,

78
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,931
everything stays right where it is.

79
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,445
Doesn't drop an inch.

80
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,211
Your king says he betrayed me for love.

81
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,366
I say he betrayed
me for firm tits and a tight fit.

82
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,161
And I can respect that.

83
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,248
When I was your age, I'd have broken 50 oaths

84
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,648
to get into that without a second thought.

85
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,842
Well, I've enough room in the hall for you lot.

86
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,130
We'll set up tents outside
with food and ale for the rest of your men.

87
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,130
Thank you, my lord.

88
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,961
Well, let's get ready.

89
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,364
The wine will flow red

90
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,801
and the music will play loud

91
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,171
and we'll put this mess behind us.

92
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,560
Where?

93
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,165
There.

94
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,650
There. It's a back gate.

95
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,121
My men use it
when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves.

96
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,884
Your men, but not you?

97
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,650
I have no interest in slaves.

98
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,848
A man cannot make love to property.

99
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,444
This is where we enter
the city. Very few guards. They know me.

100
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,801
They let me inside...

101
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,121
We're not gonna
sneak an army through a back gate.

102
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,361
I kill the guards.

103
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,926
I take your two best men

104
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,123
and lead them
through the back streets, which I know well,

105
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,202
and open the front gates.

106
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,531
Then comes the army.

107
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,126
Once the walls are breached,
the city will fall in hours.

108
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,885
Or perhaps you'll lead Grey
Worm and me to the slaughter,

109
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,489
cutting the head off our army.

110
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,529
The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee

111
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,444
and you won't have to split it three ways

112
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,722
'cause you've already
slaughtered your partners.

113
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,485
You have a very suspicious mind.

114
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,131
In my experience,
only dishonest people think this way.

115
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,562
You command the Unsullied.

116
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,765
What do you think?

117
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,527
You are a leader now.

118
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,930
Do you trust him?

119
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,851
I trust him.

120
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,081
You leave tonight.

121
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,968
Very good. We'll prepare.

122
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,561
Ser Jorah.

123
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,285
You can use an extra sword.

124
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,361
You're the Queensguard,
Ser Barristan. Your place is by the Queen.

125
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,128
If we are truly her loyal servants,

126
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,402
we'll do whatever needs to be done,

127
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,322
no matter the cost, no matter our pride.

128
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,088
We're west of Castle Black,

129
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,282
but the Nightfort's closest to us.

130
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,524
It was the first castle on the Wall.

131
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,002
The Watch abandoned it
during the reign of King Jaehaerys I.

132
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,527
Too big. Impossible to maintain.

133
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,167
Other than Castle Black itself,

134
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,726
the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us.

135
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,682
It's got a secret sally port,
the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself.

136
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,321
No one's used it in centuries, most likely.

137
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,043
It leads through
the Wall right down into the Nightfort,

138
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,206
if one knows how to find it,
which, it just so happens, I do.

139
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,281
How do you know all that?

140
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,167
I read about it in a very old book.

141
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,369
You know all that
from staring at marks on paper?

142
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,964
Yes.

143
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,001
You're like a wizard.

144
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,203
Our father used to tell us

145
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,205
that no wildling ever looked
upon the Wall and lived.

146
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,724
Here we are.

147
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,650
Alive.

148
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,646
Remember what happens to children who run.

149
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,411
I'm your father and I'll do the talking.

150
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,841
The roads have gone right to hell.

151
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,251
Cracked three spokes this morning.

152
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,686
Need a hand?

153
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,921
Need about eight hands.

154
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,121
Oh!

155
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,810
Got to get this
salt pork to the Twins in time for the wedding.

156
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,606
Many thanks.

157
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,330
Don't! Don't kill him.

158
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,648
Dead rats don't squeak.

159
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,484
You're so dangerous, aren't you?

160
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,404
Saying scary things to little girls.

161
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,645
Killing little
boys and old people. A real hard man you are.

162
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,161
More than anyone you know.

163
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,441
You're wrong.

164
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,562
I know a killer.

165
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,529
- A real killer.
- That so?

166
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,286
You'd be like a kitten
to him. He'd kill you with his little finger.

167
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,442
That him?

168
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,683
- No.
- Good.

169
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,163
Don't kill him.

170
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,410
Please.

171
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,445
Please don't.

172
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,601
You're very kind. Someday it'll get you killed.

173
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,089
Where are we?

174
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,929
The Gift, I think.

175
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,164
Brandon the Builder gave all this land

176
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,964
south of the Wall to the Night's Watch

177
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,606
for their sustenance and support.

178
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,004
Maester Luwin taught me that.

179
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,328
Doesn't seem to be supporting
anyone at the moment.

180
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,521
It's good land, and there's no war up here.

181
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,447
Why leave?

182
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,170
Wildlings.

183
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,086
Sorry.

184
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,526
But they come over
the Wall and raid, steal, carry off women.

185
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,682
Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup

186
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,848
and make you drink your own blood from it.

187
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,205
That's what Old Nan said.

188
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,921
There's a storm coming.

189
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,241
I don't see any.

190
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,765
It's as good a place to shelter as any.

191
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,208
We can drink some blood while we wait.

192
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,610
I don't need much.

193
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,960
Only one old man
and eight good horses.

194
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,805
What's one old man doing with eight horses?

195
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,844
He breeds them for the Watch.

196
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,763
How's he keep folks from stealing them?

197
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,970
The Watch protects him.

198
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,649
Not today, they don't.

199
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,481
He's selling horses,
he's got some gold in there.

200
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,041
And proper steel.

201
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,366
Let's carve him up.

202
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,930
We just take the horses and go.

203
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,570
The old man's no threat.

204
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,171
I keep telling you.

205
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,281
He's an old man.
A spear through the heart's a better way to die

206
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,091
than coughing up your
last with no one but your horses to hear.

207
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,242
The Watch might send
a few men looking for a horse thief.

208
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,164
They'll send a lot more
to hunt down murderers.

209
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,962
I hope so.
Killing crows in their castle is tough.

210
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,681
Killing them out
here in the open, that's what we do.

211
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,922
Spread out. Surround the hut and move in.

212
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,847
Ygritte!

213
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,891
Clear the barn!

214
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,287
No one's going to believe
you're a hog farmer if you eat them all.

215
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,763
Best part of the animal.

216
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,284
Don't worry. They're still there.

217
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,365
I know they're still there.

218
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,042
You check every five minutes
like you're afraid they're gonna move.

219
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,726
I'm not afraid.

220
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,006
Of course you are.

221
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,602
You're almost there
and you're afraid you won't make it.

222
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,203
The closer you get, the worse the fear gets.

223
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,486
No point in trying to hide behind that face.

224
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,446
I know fear when I see it.

225
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,329
Seen it a lot.

226
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,245
I knew fear when I saw it in you.

227
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,682
You're afraid of fire.

228
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,405
When Beric's sword went up in flames,

229
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,045
you looked like a scared little girl.

230
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,929
And I know why, too.

231
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,242
I heard what your brother did to you.

232
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,367
Pressed your face to
the fire like you're a nice juicy mutton chop.

233
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,243
That give you some ideas?

234
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,283
Might do.

235
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,370
Go ahead, then. You might get away.

236
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,048
Might even make it there on your own.

237
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,243
They're just over the river.

238
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,361
The closest you've been to family

239
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,767
since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy's neck.

240
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,568
Someday I'll put a sword through

241
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,762
your eye and out the back of your skull.

242
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,161
How are we going to get past the Wall?

243
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,481
My uncle said it's 700 feet high.

244
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,806
How did you get past it?

245
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,881
Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals.

246
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,250
It would take us two months
to get to the Bay of Seals.

247
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,090
Some climb straight up the ice.

248
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,810
Even Hodor's not strong enough to

249
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,570
climb the Wall with me on his back.

250
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,687
Hodor.

251
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,361
Nineteen castles guard the Wall.

252
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,441
Only three are still manned.

253
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,561
Hodor!

254
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,842
One of those abandoned
fortresses will give us a way through.

255
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,843
My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice

256
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,849
and stone when the castles were deserted.

257
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,488
Well, we'll have to open them up again.

258
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,763
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

259
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,285
There's a rider out there.

260
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,570
Just one?

261
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,404
There's more.
- Hodor!

262
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,725
It's just thunder, sweet giant.

263
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,171
Hodor.

264
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,523
I yield.

265
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,165
- I yield.
- Wildlings.

266
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,806
Where's Shaggydog and Summer?

267
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,961
Hunting.

268
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,928
Hodor!

269
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,131
- Shh. Quiet, Hodor.
- Hodor!

270
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,282
Make him shut up. If they hear us...

271
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,725
Hush, Hodor. No... No more Hodoring.

272
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,245
Hodor!

273
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,970
- Hodor!
- Hodor, calm down.

274
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,929
- You need to keep quiet.
- They're gonna hear us.

275
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,925
Hodor, be quiet.

276
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,563
- Hodor!
- Hodor, calm down.

277
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,051
Hodor! Hodor!

278
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,525
Hodor, be quiet!

279
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,646
What did you do?

280
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,049
Nothing.

281
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,210
I don't know.

282
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,760
What's that?

283
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,441
That's a horse dying.

284
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,961
Bring them over here.

285
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,091
That was
the last of them. The rest are dead.

286
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,722
I heard shouting up there.

287
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,086
Thunder.

288
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,087
I know the difference
between shouting and thunder.

289
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,961
Maybe it's ghosts.

290
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,086
That won't help you, grandpa.

291
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,965
Where you riding?

292
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,089
Doesn't matter now, does it?

293
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,561
No, it doesn't matter now.

294
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,683
Cut his throat,
or he'll tell the crows we're here.

295
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,361
You understand.

296
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,286
Let me stand at least.

297
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,762
Let me go with a bit of dignity.

298
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,491
Make the crow kill him.

299
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,443
You're one of us now. Prove it.

300
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,690
The wolves are out there.

301
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,005
I can't do it by choice.

302
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,165
I don't know how.

303
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,130
It happens in my dreams.

304
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,046
You're a warg, Bran. It's in your blood.

305
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,881
I can't.

306
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,043
You just did, with him.

307
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,721
A wolf is nothing compared to that.

308
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,166
She looks sharp.

309
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,804
Do it.

310
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,325
Do it.

311
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,450
I told you. He's still one of them.

312
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,160
Go on, boy.

313
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,725
Go on!

314
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,611
He's a crow. He'll always be a crow.

315
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,486
And here's his crow wife guarding him.

316
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,610
He'll stab us in the back first chance he gets.

317
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,125
Kill him.

318
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,126
He's one of them.

319
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,366
No!

320
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,283
Do you hear me? Ahh!

321
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,403
You're not gonna die for one of them.

322
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,166
Do it.

323
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,443
They'll find us if you don't.

324
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,969
You were right the whole time.

325
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,407
When you hear
a songbird's whistle, you come.

326
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,686
I'm a great whistler. The greatest in the land.

327
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,244
Daario Naharis.

328
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,125
That one was quick.

329
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,488
- There may be others.
- I doubt it.

330
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,530
The Yunkish prefer
to let their slaves do their fighting for them.

331
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,964
That's what you call a few guards?

332
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,527
Come on! What do you got, huh?

333
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,563
Lord Edmure,

334
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,087
I hope I'm not a disappointment to you.

335
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,447
You're a delight to me, my lady.

336
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,242
You may now cloak
the bride and bring her under your protection.

337
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:33,208
In the sight of the Seven,
I hereby seal these two souls,

338
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,642
binding them as one for eternity.

339
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,405
Look upon each other and say the words.

340
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,249
- Father, Smith...
- Father, Smith...

341
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,687
- ...Warrior, Mother...
- ...Warrior, Mother...

342
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,849
- ...Maiden, Crone, Stranger.
- ...Maiden, Crone, Stranger.

343
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,130
- I am hers...
- I am his...

344
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,202
- ...and she is mine...
- ...and he is mine...

345
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,762
...from this day
until the end of my days.

346
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,365
Is that safe?

347
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,885
They're long gone.

348
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,286
You were right.

349
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,443
I can get inside
Summer's mind whenever I want.

350
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,249
Of course you can.

351
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,323
North of the Wall there are wildlings

352
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,283
who can control all sorts of animals.

353
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,364
But you did a lot more than that.

354
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,801
You got inside Hodor's mind.

355
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,130
They can't do that north of the Wall?

356
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,724
No one can do that. Anywhere.

357
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,087
When I was looking through Summer's eyes,

358
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,764
- I saw Jon.
- Where?

359
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,080
He was with the wildlings.

360
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,483
They tried to kill him, but he got away.

361
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,284
He'll be heading back
to Castle Black, then.

362
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,246
That's where we should go.

363
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,721
For all we know,
Castle Black's already under attack.

364
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,241
If this many wildlings got through...

365
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,481
I already told you.

366
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,405
I'm not going north of the Wall.

367
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,369
Everything Jojen told me is true.

368
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,648
You saw what I did to Hodor.

369
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,763
I have to find the three-eyed raven.

370
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,330
Listen to me, little lord.

371
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,640
Don't worry.

372
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,602
I'm not asking you to come with me.

373
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,331
It won't be safe for Rickon.

374
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,526
Me? I'm coming with you.

375
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,125
No.

376
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,531
You and Osha and Shaggydog
head for the Last Hearth.

377
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,843
The Umbers are our bannermen.
They'll protect you.

378
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:40,926
I'm coming with you.
I'm your brother. I have to protect you.

379
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,011
Right now I have to protect you.

380
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,650
Robb's at war and I'm going beyond the Wall.

381
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,803
If something happens to us,
you're the heir to Winterfell.

382
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,049
Would you know how to find the Last Hearth?

383
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,567
You Southerners
build your big castles and you never move.

384
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,971
You're easy to find.

385
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,847
We're not Southerners.

386
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,848
And I don't want to leave you.

387
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,921
Shh!

388
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,968
Come here, little soldier.

389
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,369
You and me,
we're gonna have some adventures.

390
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,009
You don't have to do any of this.

391
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,281
Your family took me in
and was good to me without cause.

392
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,167
We'll be fine, you and me.

393
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,290
The Umbers are great warriors. Even I
heard about them growing up.

394
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,368
They'll teach you how to swing a sword.

395
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,686
I know how to swing a sword.

396
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,605
You're leaving now?
It's the middle of the night.

397
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,250
I learned to walk in darkness.

398
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,486
Say your good-byes, little man.

399
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,690
Keep this one safe.

400
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,526
He means the world to me.

401
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,527
We've been waiting a long time.

402
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,324
Haven't we?

403
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,404
Well, I don't know, you tell me.

404
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,324
How long does it take to sack a city?

405
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,809
It was just as you said.

406
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,165
They did not believe until it was too late.

407
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:02,565
Their slave soldiers
threw down their spears and surrendered.

408
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,248
And Daario Naharis?

409
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,481
The city is yours, my queen.

410
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,171
They're good, aren't they?

411
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,321
They ought to be because they cost enough.

412
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,289
Look at the crowd there.

413
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,965
He complained about this marriage

414
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,247
the entire ride from Riverrun,

415
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,560
and now look at him.

416
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,881
The Gods love to reward a fool.

417
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,565
- Uncle.
- What?

418
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:28,400
He's my nephew. I love him.
And he's a damned fool.

419
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,928
Don't you drink, Lord Bolton?

420
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,446
Never do, my lady. Dulls the senses.

421
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,522
That's the point.

422
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,602
Didn't you marry one of these Frey girls?

423
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,446
Aye. Lord Walder
let me choose any of his granddaughters

424
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,527
and promised me
the girl's weight in silver as a dowry.

425
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,284
So I have a fat young bride.

426
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,203
I hope she makes you very happy.

427
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,044
Well, she's made me very rich.

428
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:03,127
Pardon, my lord,
my lady. I need to find a tree to piss on.

429
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,127
My mother's alone
with Roose Bolton. I should rescue her.

430
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,727
Your mother is less in need of rescue
than any woman I've ever met.

431
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,050
Be kind. She's finally starting to like you.

432
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,564
And I like her.

433
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,962
But if she had her way,
I would be back in Volantis

434
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,328
playing my harp
and you would be sitting over there,

435
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,370
eating blackberries out of Roslin Frey's hand.

436
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,488
Perhaps I've made a terrible mistake.

437
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,165
Striking your king is an act of treason.

438
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,005
No, don't.

439
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,841
Don't insult them.

440
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,529
Your Grace.

441
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,565
The septon has prayed his prayers,

442
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,563
some words were said,

443
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,487
and Lord Edmure
has wrapped my daughter in a cloak.

444
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:11,849
But they are not yet man and wife.

445
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,763
A sword needs a sheath.

446
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,165
And a wedding needs a bedding.

447
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,049
What does my sire say?

448
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,044
To bed! To bed! To bed!

449
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,924
If you think
the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means,

450
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,041
let us bed them.

451
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,771
To bed! To bed! To bed!

452
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,205
Go on.

453
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,760
Ho-ho!

454
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,764
Careful now, ladies.

455
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,842
Once you set that monster free,

456
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,962
there's no caging him again.

457
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,803
To bed! To bed! To bed!

458
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,443
Poor girl.

459
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,251
Every bride suffers the same.

460
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,766
I'm sure you endured yours with grace.

461
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,842
Oh, Ned forbade it.

462
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,444
He said it wouldn't be right
if he broke a man's jaw on our wedding night.

463
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,204
That is a very strange custom.

464
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,008
I suppose it does
seem strange from a foreigner's perspective.

465
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,570
It seems normal to you?

466
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,960
It's a tradition.

467
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,686
Without the bedding ceremony,
there's no real proof

468
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,603
the lord and lady
consummated their marriage.

469
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,730
No, but there
are other ways of providing proof.

470
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,731
Boy or girl?

471
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,165
I don't know.

472
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,084
But if it's a boy,
I know what we should name him.

473
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,810
Oh, do you?

474
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,803
It seems to me the father
should have some say in his son's naming.

475
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,086
Eddard.

476
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,410
Don't you want to
teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses?

477
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,444
I do.

478
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,729
Go on, line 'em up!

479
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,330
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

480
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,126
Where are you going?

481
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,164
Got salt pork for the feast.

482
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,605
The feast is over.

483
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,008
Doesn't sound like it's over.

484
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,924
If I tell you it's over, it's over.

485
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,327
Turn this cart around
and get the hell out of here.

486
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,004
Got pig's feet, too.

487
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:26,047
Are you soft in the head?
Turn this cart around.

488
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,365
Your Grace.

489
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:52,681
I feel I've been remiss in my duties.

490
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,123
I've given you meat and wine and music,

491
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:01,684
but I haven't shown you
the hospitality you deserve.

492
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:07,688
My king has married
and I owe my new queen a wedding gift.

493
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,761
Robb!

494
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,807
Ohh!

495
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,769
Ahh!

496
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,246
Ahh!

497
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,283
You ready to head home to Winterfell, eh?

498
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,046
Feast over yet, is it?

499
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,121
Aye, it's over.

500
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,850
Aim!

501
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,201
It's too late.

502
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,563
The King in the North arises.

503
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,201
Lord Walder!

504
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,850
Lord Walder, enough!

505
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,289
Let it end!

506
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,205
Please. He is my son.

507
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,608
My first son.

508
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,206
Let him go,
and I swear that we will forget this.

509
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,164
I swear it by the Old Gods and New.

510
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,530
We will take no vengeance.

511
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:50,161
You already swore me
one oath right here in my castle.

512
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,926
You swore by all the Gods
your son would marry my daughter!

513
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,447
Take me
for a hostage, but let Robb go.

514
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,282
Robb, get up. Get up and walk out.

515
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,525
Please!

516
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,484
Please!

517
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:12,444
And why would I let him do that?

518
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,763
On my honor as a Tully,

519
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,200
on my honor as a Stark,

520
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,404
let him go, or I will cut your wife's throat.

521
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,160
I'll find another.

522
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,123
Mother.

523
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,284
The Lannisters send their regards.

1
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,405
Go, move out!

2
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,971
Here comes the King in the North!

3
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,202
The King in the North! The King in the North!

4
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,282
Here comes the King in the North!

5
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,488
The King in the North! The King in the North!

6
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,005
Here comes the King in the North!

7
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,610
Here comes the King in the North!

8
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,488
Here comes the King in the North!

9
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,602
The King in the North! The King in the North!

10
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,806
Here comes the King in the North!

11
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,086
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield
and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

12
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,003
What are you doing?

13
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,684
I have a list.

14
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,649
A list of people you mean to kill?

15
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,200
For laughing at me?
Do I look like Joffrey to you?

16
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,083
No, death seems a bit extreme.

17
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,083
Fear of death, on the other hand...

18
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,764
You should learn to ignore them.

19
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,729
My lady, people have been laughing at me

20
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,723
far longer than they've been laughing at you.

21
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,927
I'm the halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp.

22
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,411
You're a Lannister.

23
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,848
I am the disgraced daughter
of the traitor Ned Stark.

24
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,600
The disgraced daughter
and the Demon Monkey.

25
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,681
We're perfect for each other.

26
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,368
So how should we punish them?

27
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,851
Who? Whom?

28
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,845
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield
and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

29
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,524
Ah!

30
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,002
I could speak to Lord Varys
and learn their perversions.

31
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,522
Anyone named
Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.

32
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,888
I hear that you're a pervert.

33
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,280
I am the Imp.

34
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,646
I have certain standards to maintain.

35
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,964
We could sheep shift Lord Desmond's bed.

36
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,049
You cut a little hole in his mattress

37
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,123
and you stuff sheep dung inside.

38
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,249
Then you sew up the hole
and make his bed again.

39
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,051
His room will stink,
but he won't know where it's coming from.

40
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,690
Lady Sansa!

41
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,127
My sister used to do that
when she was angry with me.

42
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,646
And she was always angry with me.

43
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,688
Why "sheep shift"?

44
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,162
That's the vulgar word for "dung."

45
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,201
My lady...

46
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,611
Well, you asked me.

47
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,326
That's him!

48
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,643
My lord, my lady-

49
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,690
Your father has called
a meeting of the Small Council.

50
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,361
Killed a few puppies today?

51
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,361
Show him.

52
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,169
Come on, show him.

53
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,885
Oh!

54
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,448
Apologies, my lord. Old fingers.

55
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,250
"Roslin caught a fine fat trout.

56
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,841
"Her brothers gave her
a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding."

57
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,605
Signed, "Walder Frey."

58
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,445
Is that bad poetry
or is it supposed to mean something?

59
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,488
Robb Stark is dead.

60
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,401
And his bitch mother.

61
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,325
Write back to Lord Frey.

62
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:17,169
Thank him for his service and command
him to send Robb Stark's head.

63
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,323
I'm going to
serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast.

64
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,842
Your Grace, Lady Sansa
is your aunt by marriage.

65
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,366
A joke. Joffrey did not mean it.

66
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,010
Yes, I did.

67
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,004
I'm going to have it
served to Sansa at my wedding feast.

68
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,491
No.

69
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,801
She is no longer yours to torment.

70
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,331
Everyone is mine to torment.

71
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,130
You'd do well
to remember that, you little monster.

72
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,089
Oh, I'm a monster.

73
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,562
Perhaps you should speak
to me more softly, then.

74
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:55,410
Monsters are dangerous,
and just now kings are dying like flies.

75
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,006
I could have your tongue out for saying that.

76
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,047
Let him make his threats.

77
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,121
Hmm?

78
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,083
He's a bitter little man.

79
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,249
Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately.

80
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,326
Unacceptable, disrespectful,
and in very bad taste.

81
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,006
I am the King!

82
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,765
I will punish you.

83
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,090
Any man who must say,
"I am the King," is no true king.

84
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,850
I'll make sure you understand that

85
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,564
when I've won your war for you.

86
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,964
My father won the real war.
He killed Prince Rhaegar.

87
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,011
He took the crown
while you hid under Casterly Rock!

88
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,049
The King is tired. See him to his chambers.

89
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,009
- Come along.
- I'm not tired.

90
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,048
We have so much to celebrate.

91
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,731
A wedding to plan. You must rest.

92
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,883
Grand Maester,
perhaps some essence of nightshade

93
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,327
to help him sleep.

94
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,768
I'm not tired!

95
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,081
Come.

96
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,885
Not you.

97
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,682
You just sent the most powerful man

98
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,922
in Westeros to bed without his supper.

99
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,048
You're a fool if you believe he's the
most powerful man in Westeros.

100
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,169
A treasonous statement. Joffrey is King.

101
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,891
You really think a crown gives you power?

102
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,006
No.

103
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,848
I think armies give you power.

104
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,524
Mmm-hmm.

105
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,843
Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle,

106
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,721
and you defeated him all the same.

107
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,881
Mmm-hmm.

108
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,883
Oh, I know.

109
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,804
Walder Frey gets all the credit.

110
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,566
Or the blame, I suppose,
depending on your allegiance.

111
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,164
Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man?

112
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,240
No.

113
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,841
He never would have risked such an action

114
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,287
if he didn't have certain assurances.

115
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,522
Which he got from me.

116
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,128
Do you disapprove?

117
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,089
I'm all for cheating. This is war.

118
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,288
But to slaughter them at a wedding...

119
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,131
Explain to me why it is more noble

120
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,443
to kill 10,000 men in battle
than a dozen at dinner.

121
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,206
So that's why you did it? To save lives?

122
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,449
To end the war. To protect the family.

123
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,205
Do you want to write a song
for the dead Starks?

124
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,967
Go ahead, write one.

125
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,602
I'm in this world a little while longer

126
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,401
to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood.

127
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,960
The Northerners will never forget.

128
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,485
Good.

129
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,360
Let them remember
what happens when they march on the South.

130
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,250
All the Stark men are dead.

131
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,283
Winterfell is a ruin.

132
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,040
Roose Bolton will be named
Warden of the North

133
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,891
until your son by Sansa comes of age.

134
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,647
I believe you
still have some work to do on that score.

135
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,123
Do you think she'll open her legs for me

136
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,647
after I tell her
how we murdered her mother and brother?

137
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,883
One way or another,
you will get that girl pregnant.

138
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,247
I will not rape her.

139
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,003
Shall I explain to you
in one easy lesson how the world works?

140
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,970
Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.

141
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,123
The house that
puts family first will always defeat

142
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,362
the house that puts the whims and wishes

143
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,608
of its sons and daughters first.

144
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,122
A good man does everything in his power

145
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,487
to better his family's position,

146
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,808
regardless of his own selfish desires.

147
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,524
Does that amuse you?

148
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,001
No, it's a very good lesson.

149
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,209
Only it's easy for you
to preach utter devotion to family

150
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,965
when you're making all the decisions.

151
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,883
Easy for me, is it?

152
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,328
When have you ever
done something that wasn't in your interest,

153
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,607
but solely for the benefit of the family?

154
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,251
The day that you were born.

155
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,843
I wanted to carry you into the sea

156
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,928
and let the waves wash you away.

157
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,642
Instead, I let you live.

158
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,321
And I brought you up as my son.

159
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,085
Because you're a Lannister.

160
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,441
Sansa.

161
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,371
It's empty-

162
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,811
Let's find a place to sleep.

163
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,364
Hodor.

164
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,530
Hodor.

165
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,602
Don't, Hodor.

166
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,530
Maybe we shouldn't stay here.

167
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,602
You'd rather be out there?

168
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,410
There are a lot of stories about this place.

169
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,885
Horrible stories.

170
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,048
I always quite liked the horrible stories.

171
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,766
So did I. Once.

172
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,329
You ever heard about the Rat Cook?

173
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,687
No. Who's he?

174
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,206
Just a cook in the Night's Watch.

175
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,044
He was angry at
the King for something, I don't remember.

176
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,165
When the King was visiting the Nightfort,

177
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,527
the cook killed the King's son,

178
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,288
cooked him into a big pie
with onions, carrots, mushrooms, and bacon.

179
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,449
That night he served the pie to the King.

180
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,127
He liked the taste of his son so
much, he asked for a second slice.

181
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,569
The Gods turned the cook
into a giant white rat

182
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,042
who could only eat his own young.

183
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:29,446
He's been roaming the Nightfort ever
since, devouring his own babies.

184
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,681
But no matter what he does,
he's always hungry.

185
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,889
If the Gods
turned every killer into a giant white rat...

186
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,406
it wasn't for murder
the Gods cursed the Rat Cook

187
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,165
or for serving the King's son in a pie.

188
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,561
He killed a guest beneath his roof.

189
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,484
That's something the Gods can't forgive.

190
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,206
"The late Walder Frey," old Tully called me

191
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,921
because I didn't get
my men to the Trident in time for battle.

192
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,128
He thought he was witty.

193
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,767
Look at us now, Tully.

194
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,686
You're dead,
your daughter's dead, your grandson's dead,

195
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,170
your son spent
his wedding night in a dungeon,

196
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,210
and I'm Lord of Riverrun.

197
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,689
The Blackfish escaped.

198
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,963
An old man on the run with no allies.

199
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,043
I have Tywin Lannister backing me.

200
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,366
Who does he have?

201
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,760
As you say.

202
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,802
They all laughed at me, all those high lords.

203
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,929
They all thought they were better than me.

204
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,606
Ned Stark, Hoster Tully.

205
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,966
People snigger when I marry a young girl,

206
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,647
but who said a word
when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?

207
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,643
You'll be needing a new young girl.

208
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,051
Yeah.

209
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,327
Got that to look forward to.

210
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,801
Hmm.

211
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,601
And you, the Warden of the North.

212
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,850
No more Starks to bow and scrape to.

213
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,727
Must have been torture
following that stupid boy all over the country.

214
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,401
He ignored my advice at every turn.

215
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,927
If he'd been a trifle less arrogant...

216
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,244
Calling himself
the "Young Wolf." How's that for pomposity?

217
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,764
Well, here's to the Young Wolf!

218
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,965
Forever young.

219
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,201
Will you move to Winterfell
now that the war's over?

220
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,289
At some point perhaps.

221
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,009
But Winterfell's in ruins.

222
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,570
Yeah.

223
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,848
What happened up there?
I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place.

224
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,801
I heard he
killed all the ravens. And after that, nothing.

225
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,925
I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out.

226
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,328
Robb Stark offered amnesty for the
ironborn if they gave us Theon.

227
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,090
Oh. And?

228
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,889
Ramsay delivered the terms.

229
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:12,170
The ironborn turned on Theon,
as we knew they would.

230
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,204
They handed him over trussed and hooded.

231
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,880
But Ramsay, well...

232
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,000
Ramsay has his own way of doing things.

233
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,681
Well, the girls weren't
lying. You had a good-sized cock.

234
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,805
What?

235
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,366
No.

236
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,649
Pork sausage.

237
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,402
You think I'm some sort of savage?

238
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,164
People talk about phantom limbs.

239
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,241
An amputee might
have an itch where his foot used to be.

240
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,163
So I've always wondered,

241
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,048
do eunuchs have a phantom cock?

242
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,802
Next time you think about naked girls,

243
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,683
will you feel an itch?

244
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,045
Sorry.

245
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,488
I shouldn't make jokes.

246
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,686
My mother taught me
not to throw stones at cripples.

247
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,087
But my father taught me to aim for their head.

248
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,885
Kill me.

249
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,885
Sorry, what?

250
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,044
Kill me.

251
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,405
A little louder.

252
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,764
Kill me!

253
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,962
You're no good to me dead. We need you.

254
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,282
You don't look like a Theon Greyjoy anymore.

255
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,848
That's a name for a lord.

256
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,602
But you're not a lord, are you?

257
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,046
You're just meat.

258
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,925
Stinking meat.

259
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,410
You reek.

260
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,210
Reek!

261
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,362
That's a good name for you.

262
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,326
What's your name?

263
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,290
Theon Greyjoy.

264
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,450
What's your name?

265
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,608
Theon Greyjoy.

266
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,246
Please.

267
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,370
What is your name?

268
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,081
Reek.

269
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,290
My name is...

270
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,490
Reek.

271
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,525
Hodor.

272
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,044
- Don't kill me!
- Who are you?

273
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,407
- Sam! Sam!
- Who are you?

274
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,448
Gilly. Don't hurt us.

275
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,564
Where are you going?

276
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,122
To Castle Black.
I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.

277
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,281
My brother, he's in the Night's...

278
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,169
- Who's your brother?
Doesn't matter.

279
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,485
You're Jon's brother.

280
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,086
The one who fell from the window.

281
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,526
No, I'm not.

282
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:17,084
I've been around Ghost
enough to know a direwolf when I see one.

283
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,522
And I've heard all about Hodor.

284
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,090
Hodor.

285
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,447
I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon.

286
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,642
If you're his brother, you're my brother, too.

287
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,888
And anything I can do to help you, I will.

288
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,125
Take us north of the Wall.

289
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,082
What? Why in the world
would you want to go...

290
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,322
I don't want to. I have to.

291
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,686
How did you get through the Wall?

292
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,963
Does the well lead to an underground
river? Is that how you came here?

293
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,648
Come with us.

294
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,883
There are steps carved
into the south side of the Wall.

295
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,803
Hodor can carry you to the top.

296
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,121
We'll walk straight to Castle Black.

297
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,170
Come with us.
There's nothing north but death.

298
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,690
If Jon is alive,
then Castle Black's where he'll be.

299
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,683
It's the safest place for you.

300
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,286
There's nowhere
safe any longer. You know that.

301
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,442
What I know is what I saw.

302
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,768
And if you saw it, too,
you'd run the other way.

303
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,208
You saw the White Walkers
and the army of the dead.

304
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,770
How do you know all that?

305
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,451
The Night's Watch can't stop them.

306
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,888
The Kings of Westeros
and all their armies can't stop them.

307
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,082
But you're going to stop them?

308
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,685
Please, Sam.

309
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,849
I have to go north.

310
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,369
I have to.

311
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:21,970
"Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron
Islands and invader of the North.

312
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,566
"I give you until the full moon

313
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,246
"to order all ironborn scum out of the North

314
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,729
"and back to those
shit-stained rocks you call a home.

315
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,451
"On the first night of the full moon,

316
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,444
"I will hunt down every islander

317
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,564
"still in our lands and flay them living,

318
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:47,731
"the way I flayed
the 20 ironborn scum I found at Winterfell.

319
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,368
"In the box you'll find a special gift...

320
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,086
"Theon's favorite toy.

321
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,889
"He cried when I took it away from him.

322
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,647
"Leave the North now,
or more boxes will follow

323
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,283
"with more Theon."

324
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,048
Signed, "Ramsay Snow,
natural-born son of Roose Bolton,

325
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,203
"Lord of the Dreadfort
and Warden of the North."

326
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,002
Get that out of my sight.

327
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,083
Theon disobeyed my orders.

328
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,048
The boy is a fool.

329
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,770
He cannot further the Greyjoy line.

330
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,762
I will not give up the lands I have seized,

331
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,481
the strongholds I have taken.
Get this away from me.

332
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,085
He's your son.

333
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,725
Son?

334
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,891
He's not a man anymore.

335
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,009
He's your son. He's my brother.

336
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,080
He's a Greyjoy.

337
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,844
Watch yourself.

338
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,483
I've made my decision.

339
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,882
And I've made mine.

340
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,850
I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.

341
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,604
I'm going to choose
the 50 best killers on the Iron Islands.

342
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,689
Get those ropes!

343
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,408
I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea,

344
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,682
all the way to the Weeping Water.

345
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,123
I'm going to march on the Dreadfort.

346
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,885
I'm going to find my little brother,

347
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,725
and I'm going to bring him home.

348
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,731
What is it?

349
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,451
Dragonglass.

350
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,204
We found them at the Fist.

351
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,205
Someone buried them a long time ago.

352
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,003
Someone wanted us to find them.

353
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,730
Why? What are they for?

354
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,210
Killing White Walkers.

355
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,004
How do you know that?

356
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,048
The Walker came for my baby.

357
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,646
And Sam...

358
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,849
But no one's killed
a White Walker in thousands of years.

359
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,561
Well, I suppose someone had to be the first.

360
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,969
Take it, Hodor.

361
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,524
And the archer.

362
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,604
I got lucky with one of them.

363
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,446
There are more.

364
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,400
Many more.

365
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,368
And for every one of them,

366
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,450
the dead men,

367
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,125
more than you could count.

368
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,924
I wish you'd come with us.

369
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,724
I wish I could.

370
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,049
I really do.

371
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,165
How are you keeping?

372
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,723
Great. Never better.

373
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,088
It was just a bit of blood.

374
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,009
I should have known.

375
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,368
Every time
a highborn asks my name, it's trouble.

376
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,609
We're not really people to you.

377
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,449
Just ways to get what you want.

378
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,681
I'm not a highborn.

379
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,046
She called you "Ser."

380
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,485
I heard it.

381
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,406
A recent state of affairs.

382
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,686
I was born in Flea Bottom, just like you.

383
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,521
Sure, you were.
You're my friend. You're here to help.

384
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,523
I lived below the Street of Flour.

385
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,047
How far below?
How close to the Red Keep were you?

386
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,120
The shit that poured from their privy pipes

387
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,921
flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill,

388
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,846
along Tanner's Row
and right in front of my front door

389
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,922
- On Gin Alley.
- Gin Alley.

390
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,770
The Street of Steel,
with your armor and your knights?

391
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,481
You lived in the fancy part of town.

392
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,170
And here we are now.

393
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,007
Two boys from Flea Bottom
in the castle of a king.

394
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,528
Yeah, we've come a long way.

395
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,682
We're all the same, really.

396
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,764
She went to great pains
to point that out to me.

397
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,446
If you mistrust fancy people so much,

398
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,131
why were you in such a hurry to trust her?

399
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,051
You're me.

400
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,531
Never been with a woman.

401
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,331
Never talked to a woman, really.

402
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,845
And then she comes at you,

403
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,047
big words, no clothes.

404
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,202
What would you have done?

405
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,764
She does know her way
around a man's head, I'll give her that.

406
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,168
So how'd you become a lord?

407
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,249
Oh. That's a long story.

408
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,164
Better not, then. I'm a bit busy.

409
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,963
Many years ago I helped King
Stannis out of a difficult situation.

410
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,805
He rewarded me with a lordship.

411
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,970
And this.

412
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,005
You see?

413
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,444
Highborns.

414
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,889
I didn't want to be a lord.
I nearly didn't accept.

415
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,371
Why did you?

416
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,249
I did it for my son.

417
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,960
I didn't want him to step over a river of shit

418
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,526
every time he stepped through his front door.

419
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,606
I wanted him to have a better life.

420
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,521
Does he?

421
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,405
He's dead.

422
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,486
How'd he die?

423
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,044
Following me.

424
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,810
When did you come to this strange country?

425
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,531
When I was 13.

426
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,370
You were only a child.

427
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,086
I stopped being a child when I was nine.

428
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,842
My mother made sure of that.

429
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,571
You've been a good
influence on our mutual friend, you know.

430
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,406
He used to drink from sundown to
sunup, visit three brothels a night,

431
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,960
gamble away his father's money.

432
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,889
Now it's just the drinking.

433
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,328
And now I'm his wife's servant.

434
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,802
I brush her hair
and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot.

435
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,844
She is a sweet young thing.
None of this is her fault.

436
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,241
I love that girl. I would kill for her.

437
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,801
Do you think that makes it easier for me?

438
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,121
No, I expect not.

439
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,725
She's young
and she's beautiful and highborn.

440
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,089
We break bread with them,
but that doesn't make us family.

441
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,290
We've learned their language, but
we'll never be their countrymen.

442
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,844
If you let yourself believe

443
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,127
that a foreign girl with no name

444
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,521
could spend her life with
the son of Tywin Lannister...

445
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,931
I have a name.

446
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,366
You have one name.

447
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,889
As do I. Here, only the family name matters.

448
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,042
What do you want from me, Lord Varys?

449
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,524
Diamonds.

450
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,490
I'd tell you to beware
carrying so much wealth,

451
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,131
but you know how to protect yourself.

452
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:07,482
Get on one of those
ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr.

453
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:12,648
You can buy a house
with these diamonds, a very large house.

454
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,529
Hire servants.

455
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,491
Start a new life, a good life, far from here.

456
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,608
The mysterious foreign
beauty. You'll have suitors lining up.

457
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,844
Why do you want me to leave?

458
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,241
Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive

459
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,647
who could make this country a better place.

460
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,849
He has the mind, the will,
and the right last name.

461
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,206
And you.

462
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,089
You are a complication.

463
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,682
I know you love him.

464
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,601
And I know it's
true love, not bought by gold and silver.

465
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,047
I'm not asking you to leave him for money.

466
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,771
I'm asking you to leave

467
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:56,926
because your presence
in the capital endangers him.

468
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,651
This will never be your home, my lady.

469
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,640
Find a true home somewhere far from here,

470
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,122
while there's still time.

471
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,441
Lord Varys.

472
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,882
If he wants me to leave,
he can tell me himself.

473
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,125
Keep up.

474
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,042
I don't think I can, my lord.

475
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,691
It's not easy being drunk all the time.

476
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,725
Everyone would do it, if it were easy.

477
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,961
Leave.

478
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,530
So, enjoying married life?

479
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,646
An unhappy wife
is a wine merchant's best friend.

480
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,808
She doesn't deserve this.

481
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,325
Deserve?

482
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,289
Be careful with that.

483
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,410
Start trying to work out who deserves what,

484
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,370
and before long you'll spend your days

485
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,370
weeping for every person in the world.

486
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,808
There's nothing worse
than a late-blooming philosopher.

487
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,691
Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras

488
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,531
with the same philosophical spirit?

489
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,125
I won't be marrying Ser Loras.

490
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,047
I seem to remember saying something
similar about my own marriage.

491
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,645
You're not me.

492
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,280
You want to make
things better for Sansa? Give her a child.

493
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:49,649
So you can tell Father it was you
who finally talked me into it?

494
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,610
So she can have some happiness in her life.

495
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,330
You have children.

496
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,451
How happy would you say you are?

497
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,891
Not very.

498
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,167
But if it weren't for my children,

499
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,766
I'd have thrown myself
from the highest window in the Red Keep.

500
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,320
They're the reason I'm alive.

501
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,290
Even Joffrey?

502
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,289
Even Joffrey.

503
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,927
He was all I had once.
Before Myrcella was born.

504
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,009
I used to spend hours looking at him.

505
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,768
His wisps of hair.

506
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,566
His tiny little hands and feet.

507
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,200
He was such a jolly little fellow.

508
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,443
You always hear
the terrible ones were terrible babies.

509
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,251
"We should have known.
Even then we should have known."

510
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,765
It's nonsense.

511
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,686
Whenever he was with me, he was happy.

512
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,282
And no one can take
that away from me, not even Joffrey,

513
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,806
how it feels to have someone.

514
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,729
Someone of your own.

515
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,003
How long does it go on?

516
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,607
Until we've dealt with all our enemies.

517
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,122
Every time we
deal with an enemy, we create two more.

518
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,203
Then I suppose
it will go on for quite a long time.

519
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,481
I'm telling you, that's what she did.

520
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,842
Sounded like a cow in heat.

521
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,081
Aye, not for long.

522
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,241
That's right.

523
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,687
Black Walder shut her up right quick.

524
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,604
None of the Starks
had much to say about the end of that meal.

525
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,045
I'll tell you what, though.

526
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,727
The hardest thing was
getting that wolf's head to stay on the body.

527
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,961
You sewed it on?

528
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,286
I did.

529
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,204
I bet there were 1,000 men
claiming they were the one.

530
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,009
It was me.

531
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,844
And Malcolm and Talbott.

532
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,925
Well, the thing was so heavy,
it fell off the first time.

533
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,445
Took the skin right with it.

534
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,570
What we ended up
having to do was hook the needle

535
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,971
right under the collarbone,

536
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,811
give it a nice firm mooring and...

537
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,565
What do you want?

538
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,801
Mind if I keep warm?

539
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,126
Fuck off.

540
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,001
But I'm hungry.

541
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,482
Does "fuck off" mean
something different where you're from?

542
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,364
I've got money.

543
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,730
What kind of coin is that?

544
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,410
It's worth a lot.

545
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,491
Sorry.

546
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,644
Little shit.

547
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,050
Fool!

548
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,600
Where did you get the knife?

549
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,205
From you.

550
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,127
Is that the first man you've killed?

551
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,124
The first man.

552
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,203
Next time you're going
to do something like that, tell me first.

553
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,968
Valar Morghulis.

554
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,245
Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice.

555
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,644
You always knew who I was, what I am.

556
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,608
I have to go home now.

557
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,408
I know you won't hurt me.

558
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,002
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

559
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,082
I do know some things.

560
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,006
I know I love you.

561
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,128
I know you love me.

562
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,128
But I have to go home now.

563
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,641
I know how this must look.

564
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,085
What I meant was...

565
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,531
I swear to you, my lord...

566
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,840
I'm not a lord, my dear.

567
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,124
Not for many, many years.

568
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:08,206
Every man who joins the Night's
Watch renounces all former titles.

569
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,011
Among other things.

570
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,890
What is your name?

571
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,605
Gilly.

572
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,761
Ah.

573
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:24,401
For the gillyflower. Lovely.

574
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,810
Yes, my...

575
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,407
Maester.

576
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,727
Master.

577
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,165
Maester.

578
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,203
And the Child?

579
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,087
She hasn't chosen a name yet.

580
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,969
His name is Sam.

581
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,051
Tarly,

582
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,169
do you remember the oath you swore

583
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,008
when you joined this order?

584
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,091
He's not my child, Maester Aemon.

585
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,289
She's one of Craster's wives.

586
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,563
I remember every word of the oath.

587
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,451
"Night gathers and my watch begins.

588
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:17,243
"I am the shield that
guards the realms of men.

589
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,927
"The realms of men."

590
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,321
That means her as well as us.

591
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:32,850
We didn't build 500 miles
of ice walls 700 feet high to keep out men.

592
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,643
The night is gathering,
Maester Aemon. I've seen it.

593
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,728
It's coming for all of us.

594
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,444
Gilly, you and your son

595
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,766
will be our guests for the time being.

596
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:57,726
We certainly
cannot send you back beyond the Wall.

597
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,925
Thank you...

598
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,805
Maester.

599
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,131
I can cook and clean and I can...

600
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,571
Good.

601
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:10,729
Samwell, fetch a quill and inkwell.

602
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,842
I hope your penmanship
is better than your swordplay.

603
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,810
Miles better.

604
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,161
We had 44 ravens at last count.

605
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,201
Make sure they're all fed.

606
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,367
Every one of them flies tonight.

607
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,010
"To His Grace

608
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,241
"King Stannis Baratheon.

609
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,370
"Invaded... Invited

610
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,164
"to the name day celebration

611
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,402
"for Rylene Florent

612
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,163
"on the first nigit..."

613
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,011
Night.

614
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,641
"First night of the full moon."

615
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,131
Why is there a "G" in night?

616
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,929
I don't know. There just is.

617
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,242
Well, your father's not going to go to that.

618
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,326
My books are better than these boring scrolls.

619
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,448
You could read about Balerion the Dread.

620
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,170
They say you can still see his skull

621
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,964
in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep.

622
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,330
I'd like to see that someday.

623
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,643
I've been trying
to stay out of those dungeons my whole life.

624
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,091
"His fangs were as long as bastard swords."

625
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,124
Aye, old Balerion's definitely better

626
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,204
than anything your cousin
Rylene's got on offer.

627
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,408
But now that I'm your father's Hand
again, I have to keep him informed.

628
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,926
The King does not have time
for this drudgery.

629
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,891
"To all the lords
and knobble men of Westeros..."

630
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,291
Noblemen.

631
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,731
"Noblemen of Westeros,

632
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,563
"the Night's Watch

633
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,486
"implores..."

634
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,526
What is it?

635
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,603
Why are they ringing the bells?

636
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,406
Are we being attacked?

637
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:21,125
Stay here. Bar the door.

638
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:44,128
The usurper Robb Stark
is dead. Betrayed by his bannerman.

639
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:49,089
And you take credit
because you dropped a leech into the fire?

640
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,889
I take no credit.

641
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,770
I have faith, and my faith has been rewarded.

642
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:01,444
Your Grace, the world has got so far bent.

643
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,923
I've seen things crawl out of
nightmares, but my eyes were open.

644
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,331
I don't know if Robb Stark died

645
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,766
because of the Red Woman's sorcery

646
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,888
or because at war men die all the time,

647
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,009
but I do know that uniting
the Seven Kingdoms

648
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:17,090
with blood magic is wrong. It is evil.

649
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,162
And you are not an evil man.

650
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,891
Do you know who had
this table carved and painted, Ser Davos?

651
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,400
Aegon Targaryen.

652
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,086
And do you know
how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros?

653
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,128
On the back of his dragon,
Balerion the Dread.

654
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,483
He had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced

655
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,809
and a smaller army, but he had three dragons.

656
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,928
Dragons are magic, Ser Davos.

657
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,322
My enemies have made my kingdom bleed.

658
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,088
I will not forget that.

659
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,322
I will not forgive that.

660
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,571
I will punish them
with any arms at my disposal.

661
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,485
You do not need to burn the boy.

662
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,840
If what you say is true,

663
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,810
a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark...

664
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,611
And our King is
still no closer to the Iron Throne.

665
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,848
A great gift requires a great sacrifice.

666
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,805
His name is Gendry. He's a good lad.

667
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:38,408
A poor lad from Flea Bottom, who
happens to be your nephew.

668
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:47,167
What is the life
of one bastard boy against a kingdom?

669
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,571
Everything.

670
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,769
The boy must die.

671
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,209
- What are you doing?
- You're leaving.

672
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,444
Is this some kind of trick?

673
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,409
Yes, but not on you.

674
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,571
Aim for that star. Don't stop.

675
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:18,086
There's bread and water. Go slow with it.

676
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:22,524
If you finish it off,
no matter how thirsty you get,

677
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,203
don't drink seawater.

678
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,044
I know not to drink seawater.

679
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,727
Row for a full day and night
and you'll reach Rook's Rest.

680
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,486
You'll want to stop there.
Don't. She'll find you.

681
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,085
Where should I go?

682
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,491
You must keep the coast on your left side

683
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,011
until you reach King's Landing.

684
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,764
The gold cloaks are looking for me.

685
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,530
They were looking for me for 20 years.

686
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,369
- Do they know your face?
- No.

687
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,966
I'd worry more about the Red Woman.

688
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,970
The other way.

689
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,249
You ever been in a boat before?

690
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,766
No.

691
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,171
You know how to swim?

692
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,401
No.

693
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,926
Don't fall out. Go on.

694
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,085
Why are you doing this?

695
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,571
Because it's right.

696
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,124
And because I'm a slow learner.

697
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,249
When you get to Flea Bottom,
have a bowl of brown for me.

698
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,124
Horse approaching!

699
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,646
Halt! Halt!

700
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,683
Jon! Jon!

701
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,445
Jon, it's us.

702
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,602
I don't think he can see us.

703
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,527
Pyp?

704
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,361
Sam?

705
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,920
Hush, now. You're home.

706
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,281
Carry him inside. Gently.

707
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,529
Out of the way.

708
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,369
Step aside, country boy. People working here.

709
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,441
Cersei.

710
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,770
You don't deny it?

711
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,327
No. I let him go.

712
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:00,291
Your mercy saved the boy's life.

713
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,250
You feel good about that?

714
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,850
Aye, I do.

715
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,323
You saved one innocent.

716
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:09,848
How many tens of thousands
have you doomed?

717
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,602
There has got to be another way.

718
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,883
What other way?
Tell us about this other way.

719
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,644
I don't know, Your Grace.

720
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,650
I can't see the future in the fire.

721
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,649
Very well, Ser Davos Seaworth.

722
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,447
I, Stannis of the House Baratheon,

723
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,887
First of My Name,
Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men,

724
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,047
sentence you to die.

725
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,247
I understand.

726
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,448
But since you haven't
yet unnamed me Hand of the King,

727
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:43,046
it is my duty to advise you against it.

728
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,201
You're gonna need me.

729
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,441
Take him away.

730
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,565
Why am I gonna need you?

731
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,366
My King.

732
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,765
It's from Maester Aemon of the Night's Watch.
Their Lord Commander is dead.

733
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,161
Took a ranging party north
and never made it back.

734
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,607
One lad did, though.

735
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:12,402
What he saw beyond the Wall,
it's coming for all of us.

736
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,845
When did you learn to read?

737
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,008
Matthos taught me before he died,

738
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,282
so I could be of better service to you.

739
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:43,043
This War of Five Kings means nothing.

740
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,090
The true war lies to the north, my King.

741
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,001
Death marches on the Wall.

742
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,609
Only you can stop him.

743
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,048
You can't stop him alone.

744
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,691
You need someone to
rebuild your army for you,

745
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:01,081
someone to convince
this lord and that lord to fight for you,

746
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,288
to bring sellswords and pirates to your side.

747
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,449
I've made my decision.

748
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:13,202
He's right. You need him.
He has a part to play in the war to come.

749
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,884
You see, Ser Davos?

750
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,287
You've been saved
by that fire god you like to mock.

751
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,482
You're in His army now.

752
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:00,930
They will come, Your Grace.
When they're ready.

753
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,729
Perhaps they didn't want to be conquered.

754
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:07,643
You didn't conquer them. You liberated them.

755
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,727
People learn to love their chains.

756
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,571
This is Daenerys Targaryen,

757
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,491
the Stormborn, the Unburnt,

758
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,531
the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms
of Westeros,

759
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,082
the Mother of Dragons.

760
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,646
It is to her you owe your freedom.

761
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,051
No.

762
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:26,125
You do not owe me your freedom.

763
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,207
I cannot give it to you.

764
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,922
Your freedom is not mine to give.

765
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,888
It belongs to you and you alone.

766
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:41,646
If you want it back,
you must take it for yourselves.

767
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:44,451
Each and every one of you.

768
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,968
- Mhysa!
Mhysa!

769
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,209
Mhysa! Mhysa!

770
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,929
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!

771
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,804
What does it mean?

772
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,641
It is old Ghiscari, Khaleesi.

773
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,328
It means "mother."

774
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,971
It's all right. These people won't hurt me.

775
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,482
Mhysa! Mhysa!

776
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,208
- Mhysa! Mhysa!
- Mhysa! Mhysa!

777
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,330
Fly

778
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,604
Let me pass.

779
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:17,890
- Mhysa.
- Mhysa.

780
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,726
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!

1
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,051
- Magnificent.
- Mmm-hmm.

2
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,729
Looks fresh-forged.

3
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,801
It is.

4
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,041
No one's made a Valyrian steel sword
since the Doom of Valyria.

5
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,761
There are three living smiths
who know how to rework Valyrian steel.

6
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,366
The finest of them was in Volantis.

7
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,321
Came here to King's
Landing at my invitation.

8
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,529
Where did you get this much Valyrian steel?

9
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,081
From someone who no longer had need of it.

10
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,647
You've wanted one in the family
for a long time.

11
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,643
- And now we have two.
- Two?

12
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,044
The original weapon was absurdly large.
Plenty of steel for two swords.

13
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,847
Well, thank you. It's glorious.

14
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,364
You'll have to train your left hand.

15
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,080
Any decent swordsman
knows how to use both hands.

16
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,367
You'll never be as good.

17
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,680
No.

18
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,326
But as long as I'm better than
everyone else, it doesn't matter.

19
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,446
You can't serve in the Kingsguard
with one hand.

20
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,127
Where's that written? I can and I will.
The Kingsguard oath is for life.

21
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,168
The war is over. The King is safe.

22
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,004
The King is never safe.

23
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,651
How many people in this city alone
would love to see his head on a pike?

24
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,042
Other knights protected the King
while you were a prisoner.

25
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,044
They will continue to do so
when you go home.

26
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,481
Home?

27
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,440
You'll return to Casterly Rock
and rule in my stead.

28
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,722
You are the Lord of Casterly Rock.

29
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,611
I am the King's Hand. My place is here.

30
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,169
I don't expect to see the Rock again
before I die.

31
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,321
You know what they call me?

32
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,290
Kingslayer. Oathbreaker.
Man without honour.

33
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,004
Now you want me to
break another sacred vow.

34
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,889
You won't be breaking anything.

35
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,089
There is a precedent
to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties.

36
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,925
The King will exercise that prerogative.

37
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,087
No.

38
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,721
No?

39
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,487
No.

40
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,761
- I don't believe I asked you a question.
- There's my answer.

41
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,810
If you think your bloody honour
comes before your...

42
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,362
My bloody honour is beyond repair,
but my answer is still no.

43
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,886
I don't want Casterly
Rock, a wife, children.

44
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,161
What do you want?

45
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,011
Supper would be nice.

46
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,645
For 40 years I've tried to teach you.

47
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,728
If you haven't learned
by now, you never will.

48
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,127
Go.

49
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,728
If serving as a glorified bodyguard
is the sum of your ambition, go serve.

50
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,325
I suppose you want the sword back.

51
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,641
Keep it.

52
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,486
A one-handed man with no family
needs all the help he can get.

53
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,288
How many Dornishmen
does it take to fuck a goat?

54
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,481
Please don't.

55
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,645
Seems to me the smart place to
meet travellers is in a tavern.

56
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,930
That way, one party is late,
the other party can drink some ale inside.

57
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,130
This is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting
for, not one of your sellsword friends.

58
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,211
If he's so damned important,
how come they sent you to meet him?

59
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,726
There's bad blood between the Martells of
Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock.

60
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,245
Has been for years.

61
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,370
And just in case the Martells of Dorne
are looking to spill some Lannister blood,

62
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,363
- it may as well be yours, eh?
- No need for cynicism.

63
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,283
I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.

64
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,361
Oh.

65
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,526
Ah, here we are.

66
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,040
Can you read the sigils?

67
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,647
Yellow balls?

68
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,724
Wild lemons on a purple field,
House Dalt of Lemonwood.

69
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,041
A vulture grasping a baby in its talons,
House of Blackmont.

70
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,046
A crowned skull,
the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave.

71
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,804
Boy knows his Dornish houses.

72
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,041
I need a sigil.

73
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,243
And House Martell,
a red sun pierced by a spear?

74
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,287
I don't see it, my lord.

75
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,888
Well met, my lords. His Grace King Joffrey
welcomes you in his name.

76
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,289
My lord father, the King's Hand,
sends his greetings as well.

77
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,882
I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock,
Master of Coin.

78
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,410
Forgive me.

79
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,522
I don't see Prince Doran in your company.

80
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,446
The prince's health
forces him to remain at Sunspear.

81
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,882
He sends his brother, Prince Oberyn,
to attend the royal wedding.

82
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,327
The King will be delighted
to enjoy the company of a warrior

83
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,609
as renowned as Prince Oberyn.

84
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,886
Will he?

85
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,765
Where is Prince Oberyn?

86
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,286
Arrived before dawn.

87
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,924
Not a man for welcome parties.

88
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,771
Very well. My lords,
these fine men from the City Watch

89
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,320
will escort you to your quarters
in the Red Keep.

90
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,490
You must be weary after
such a long journey.

91
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,130
Some accomplished diplomacy that was.

92
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,201
Now where?

93
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,370
We must find Prince Oberyn before
he kills somebody, or several somebodies.

94
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,284
How do you plan on finding
a single Dornishman in a city this big?

95
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,408
You're famous for fucking half of Westeros.

96
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,404
You just arrived at the capital
after two weeks of bad road.

97
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,720
Where would you go?

98
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,929
I'd probably go to sleep,
but I'm getting old.

99
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,164
Look at this one.

100
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,889
How lovely is she?

101
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,325
Beautiful.

102
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,411
But pale.

103
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,850
We like them pale in the capital.
Shows they don't work the fields.

104
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,567
Do I frighten you?

105
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,886
You like?

106
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,811
Timid bores me.

107
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,601
Hmm.

108
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,561
You're a bit of mischief, aren't you?

109
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,765
I think she likes you.

110
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,841
She has good taste.

111
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,168
You're not timid, are you?

112
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,486
Not timid.

113
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,970
Do you like women?

114
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,320
When they look like her, my lord.

115
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,688
This one will do nicely.

116
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,890
Very good, my lady.

117
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,002
Oh, I'm not a lady.

118
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,287
A term of courtesy in this establishment.

119
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,930
A lie anywhere.

120
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,928
Why not use the right words?

121
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,684
I'm a bastard.

122
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,445
She is a whore. And you're what?

123
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,931
A procurer.

124
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,641
Any of the others?

125
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,121
The two girls can leave.

126
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,089
You stay.

127
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,004
I'm afraid I'm not on offer, my lord.

128
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,844
Everyone who works for Littlefinger
is on offer.

129
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,207
Take off your clothes.
We'll be here a while.

130
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,726
- My lord.
- I am a prince, boy.

131
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,767
Have you ever been with a prince?

132
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,041
Can't say I have.

133
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,287
I'm wildly expensive.

134
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,520
Take off your clothes.

135
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,202
Which way do you like it?

136
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,966
My way.

137
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,010
And so he spoke, and so he spoke

138
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,687
That Lord of Castamere

139
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,601
But now the rains...

140
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,727
Oberyn.

141
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,847
Weep o'er his hall...

142
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,366
Oberyn, don't.

143
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,524
With no one there to hear

144
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,968
Yes now the rains weep o'er his hall

145
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:24,089
And not a soul to hear

146
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,321
You lost, friend?

147
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,003
Forgive me for staring.

148
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,003
I don't see many Lannisters where I'm from.

149
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,924
I don't see many Dornishmen in the capital.

150
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,525
We don't like the smell.

151
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,051
- Come with me, lover.
- Gods, look at this one.

152
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,322
Sirs, if you follow me,
I'll arrange for a private room.

153
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,687
Why are you wasting a woman like this
on a Dornishman?

154
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,083
Bring him a shaved goat
and a bottle of olive oil.

155
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,881
Hmm.

156
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,769
Do you know why all the world
hates a Lannister?

157
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,881
You think your gold

158
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,685
and your lions and your gold lions
make you better than everyone.

159
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,401
May I tell you a secret?

160
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,882
You're not a golden lion.

161
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,887
You're just a pink little man
who is far too slow on the draw.

162
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,165
Longsword is a bad option
in close quarters.

163
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,649
When I pull my blade,
your friend starts bleeding.

164
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,166
Quite a lot, I'm afraid.
So many veins in the wrist.

165
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,964
He'll live if you get
him help straightaway.

166
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,771
So, decisions.

167
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,721
Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion.
We heard there might be...

168
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,765
...trouble.

169
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,084
Apologies, my love.

170
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,805
I'm here to welcome you to the capital.

171
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,327
Ellaria Sand, my paramour.

172
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,882
The King's own Uncle Imp.

173
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,440
Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister.

174
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,727
If there's anything I can do
to make your stay at King's Landing...

175
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,290
What are you? His hired killer?

176
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,610
It started that way, aye. Now I'm a knight.

177
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,011
How did that come to pass?

178
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,121
Killed the right people.

179
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,485
We'll need a few more girls. Girls, yes?

180
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,566
You don't partake?

181
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,290
Oh, I partook. Now I'm married.

182
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,444
Prince Oberyn, a word in private?

183
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,408
Seems I visited the Lannister brothel
by mistake.

184
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,006
- Oh, they take all kinds.
- Even Dornishmen.

185
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,482
The King is very grateful that you
travelled all this way for his wedding.

186
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,564
Let us speak truth here.
Joffrey is insulted.

187
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,721
I am only the second son.

188
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,121
Well, speaking as a fellow second son,

189
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,249
I have grown rather used
to being the family insult.

190
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,762
Why did you come to King's Landing?

191
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,171
I was invited to the royal wedding.

192
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,561
I thought we were speaking truth.

193
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,368
The last time I was in the capital
was many years ago.

194
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,602
Another wedding.

195
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,288
My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen,
the Last Dragon.

196
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,609
My sister loved him. She bore his children.

197
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,211
Swaddled them, rocked them,
fed them at her own breast.

198
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,602
Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them.

199
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,651
And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen

200
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,802
left her for another woman.

201
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,083
That started a war,
and the war ended right here,

202
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,843
when your father's army took the city.

203
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,441
I wasn't actually present.

204
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,727
They butchered those children.

205
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,285
My nephew and niece.

206
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,048
Carved them up
and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks.

207
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,644
And my sister,
you know what they did to her?

208
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,241
I'm asking you a question.

209
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,124
- I've heard rumours.
- Hmm.

210
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,731
So have I.

211
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,002
The one I keep hearing
is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain

212
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,324
raped Elia and split her in half
with his great sword.

213
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,204
I wasn't there. I don't know what happened.

214
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,080
If the Mountain killed my sister,
your father gave the order.

215
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,442
Tell your father I'm here.

216
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,770
And tell him the Lannisters
aren't the only ones who pay their debts.

217
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,040
They're dragons, Khaleesi.

218
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,851
They can never be tamed.

219
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,922
Not even by their mother.

220
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,047
Ser Barristan.

221
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,925
Your Grace.

222
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,406
Where's Daario Naharis?

223
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,684
Where's Grey Worm?

224
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,089
Gambling, Your Grace.

225
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,246
Gambling?

226
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,250
Mhysa. Mhysa.

227
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,602
How long have they been at it?

228
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,762
Since midnight, Your Grace.

229
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,363
Ser Worm is stronger than he looks.

230
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,090
But I can see his arms beginning to shake.

231
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,727
What's the prize
to winning this stupid contest?

232
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,882
The honour of riding by your side
on the road to Meereen.

233
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,203
That honour goes to
Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan,

234
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,726
as neither of them
kept me waiting this morning.

235
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,202
You two will ride in the rear guard
and protect the livestock.

236
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,325
The last man holding his sword
can find a new queen to fight for.

237
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,807
You like this girl?

238
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,601
Must be frustrating.

239
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,365
You are not a smart man, Daario Naharis.

240
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,763
I'd rather have no brains

241
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,642
and two balls.

242
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,802
You need to eat something.

243
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,525
Pigeon pie.

244
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,005
No, thank you.

245
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,451
Lemon cakes?

246
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,846
No, thank you.

247
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,729
You love lemon cakes.

248
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,605
Tell her she needs to eat.

249
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,330
My lady, you do need to eat.

250
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,051
I don't want to eat.

251
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,002
If I could have a moment
alone with my wife.

252
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,490
She needs to eat.

253
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,246
I can't let you starve.

254
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,850
I swore to protect you.

255
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,200
My lady,

256
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,043
I am your husband. Let me help you.

257
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,283
How can you help me?

258
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,888
I don't know, but I can try.

259
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,485
I lie awake all night
staring at the canopy,

260
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,683
thinking about how they died.

261
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,085
I could get you essence of nightshade
to help you sleep.

262
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,124
Do you know what they did to my brother?

263
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,403
How they sewed his direwolf's head
onto his body?

264
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,448
And my mother.

265
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:08,969
They cut her throat to the bone
and threw her body in the river.

266
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,049
What happened to your family
was a terrible crime.

267
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,161
I didn't know your brother.

268
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,288
He seemed like a good man,
but I didn't know him.

269
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,969
Your mother, I admired her.

270
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,049
She wanted to have me executed,
but I admired her.

271
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,283
She was a strong woman.

272
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,444
And she was fierce
when it came to protecting her children.

273
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,485
Sansa.

274
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,682
Your mother would want you to carry on.

275
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,966
You know it's true.

276
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,165
Will you pardon me, my lord?
I'd like to visit the godswood.

277
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,562
Of course. Prayer can be helpful, I hear.

278
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,281
I don't pray any more.

279
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,281
It's the only place I can go
where people don't talk to me.

280
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,281
My lion.

281
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,004
What are you doing?

282
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,409
What does it look like?

283
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,207
Come here.

284
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,760
How many times have I told you?
You can't visit me here.

285
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,049
I know. We have come to a dangerous place.

286
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,481
Have you forgotten me?
Do you know how long it's been?

287
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,800
Of course I haven't forgotten.

288
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,129
I want you.

289
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,521
Don't you want me?

290
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,642
Things are a bit tense right now.

291
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,131
What things?

292
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,247
My nephew the King wants to murder me.

293
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,891
My wife hates me
because my father murdered her family.

294
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,043
Oberyn Martell wants to murder
everyone whose last name is Lannister.

295
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,362
You need to relax.

296
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,251
Don't you want to relax?

297
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,445
- What's wrong?
- I told you.

298
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,969
- It's not a good time.
- It's never a good time.

299
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,282
- You have your child bride now.
- Shae.

300
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,327
Do you love her?

301
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,883
Love her? I barely know her. She's a child.
She despises me.

302
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,961
That's not an answer.

303
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,451
I don't love her.

304
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,802
You tried to ship me away.

305
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,405
Ship you away?

306
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,327
Give me diamonds and make me disappear.

307
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,050
What are you talking about?

308
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,929
If you want me to leave, just say it.

309
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,921
- Say it!
- Shh.

310
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,730
I don't know what you're talking about.

311
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,406
You want me to stay?

312
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,763
A work of art.

313
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,524
The craftsmanship is excellent.

314
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,251
You like it so much, you're welcome
to chop off your own hand and take it.

315
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,321
You're such an ingrate.

316
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,687
I spent days with the goldsmith
getting the details just right.

317
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,161
Days?

318
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,651
Better part of an afternoon.

319
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,049
There, how does that feel?

320
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,641
Uh...

321
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,440
A hook would be more practical.

322
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,007
Elegant, I think.

323
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,005
Thank you for your help
with the other matter.

324
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,809
- The symptoms have abated?
- Gone completely.

325
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,805
I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn.

326
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,646
Not a maester, Your Grace,
but happy to help whenever I can.

327
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,483
- Odd little man.
- I've grown fond of him.

328
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,489
He's quite talented.

329
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,090
What symptoms?

330
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,128
Symptoms that are not your concern.

331
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,328
You let him touch you?

332
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,408
You jealous?

333
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,766
I'm surprised.

334
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,251
You never let Pycelle near you.

335
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,525
You think I'd let that old lecher
put his hands on me?

336
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,484
He smells like a dead cat.

337
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,961
I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat.

338
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,969
Well, they smell like Pycelle.

339
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,241
You drink more than you used to.

340
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,083
- Yes.
- Why?

341
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,491
Hmm. Let's see.

342
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:56,163
You started a brawl in the streets with
Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital.

343
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,811
My husband died in a
tragic hunting accident.

344
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,530
It must have been traumatic for you.

345
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,045
My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne.

346
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,451
We suffered through a siege.

347
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,806
A rather short siege.

348
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,645
That I didn't expect to survive.

349
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,442
And now I'm marrying my eldest son
to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden,

350
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,809
while I'm supposed to marry her brother,
a renowned pillow-biter. So...

351
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,326
Father disowned me today.

352
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,767
He can't disown you. You're all he's got.

353
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,842
You're forgetting Tyrion.

354
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,246
You don't really plan on staying
in the Kingsguard, do you?

355
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:37,325
Staying in the Kingsguard means
I live right here in the Red Keep with you.

356
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,004
- Not now.
- I want...

357
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,084
Not now? When? I've been back for weeks.

358
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,091
- Something's changed.
- Everything's changed.

359
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,525
You come back after all this time
with no apologies and one hand

360
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,568
and expect everything to be the same?

361
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,766
What do you want me to apologise for?

362
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,921
For leaving me.

363
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,605
You think I wanted to be taken prisoner?

364
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,569
Don't know what you wanted.
You weren't here.

365
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,764
You left me alone.

366
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,561
Every day I was a prisoner,
I plotted my escape.

367
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,641
Every day.

368
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,207
I murdered people
so I could be here with you.

369
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,169
- You took too long.
- I...

370
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,965
- What are you saying?
- You took too long.

371
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,804
- Come in.
- Go away.

372
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,969
Forgive me, Your Grace.

373
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,405
You told me to come at once
if there was anything important.

374
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,124
You plan on killing all the crows yourself?

375
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,167
Do you plan on sitting here,
scratching your balls till winter?

376
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,365
We wait for Mance's orders.

377
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,408
You sent a man over the
Wall at the full moon.

378
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,404
If he's not back yet, he's not coming back.

379
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,846
And what is it you want?

380
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,091
March on Castle Black with just this lot?

381
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,481
Your pretty crow said
a thousand men are nesting there.

382
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,125
He's a liar.

383
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,361
He is?

384
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,044
Shouldn't it be "he was"?

385
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,011
You said you put three arrows in him.

386
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,241
I did.

387
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,367
I've seen you slip a shaft
through a rabbit's eye at 200 yards.

388
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,365
If that boy's still walking,

389
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,566
it's 'cause you let him go.

390
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,926
Thenns.

391
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,044
I fucking hate Thenns.

392
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,360
Mance sent you?

393
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,563
How did you find us?

394
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,166
You came from the south, not the north.

395
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,003
Took a detour.

396
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,050
Got some supper
from a village down that way.

397
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,127
Why does the meat down here
taste so much better

398
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,168
than it does on our side of the Wall?

399
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,005
Help yourself.

400
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,169
Maybe everything's just
better fed down here.

401
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,651
Fat and lazy.

402
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,286
Easier for us.

403
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,208
You didn't see us coming?

404
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,410
Lost your warg?

405
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,126
And that baby crow you had with you,

406
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,885
lost him, too?

407
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,963
I'll answer to Mance.

408
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,090
I won't answer to you.

409
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,611
She yours?

410
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,804
I'm not anybody's.

411
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,805
Too scrawny.

412
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,491
Not like those crows at Castle Black.

413
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,051
Think of them stuck in their larders,

414
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,803
stuffing their faces
with ham and blood sausage

415
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:38,842
and stew, getting nice and fat and marbled.

416
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,004
I know we've had our differences, Tormund,

417
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,167
but just one time before you die,

418
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,009
you really ought to try crow.

419
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,281
Draw.

420
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,321
Loose.

421
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,521
Last time I saw him,
he was in the courtyard at Winterfell.

422
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,680
He said, "Next time I see you,
you'll be all in black."

423
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,727
I was jealous of Robb my whole life.

424
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,643
The way my father looked at him,
I wanted that.

425
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,526
He was better than me at everything.

426
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,720
Fighting and hunting

427
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,805
and riding

428
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,371
and girls.

429
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,928
Gods, the girls loved him.

430
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,211
I wanted to hate him, but I never could.

431
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,767
Sometimes I want to hate you.

432
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,244
You're better than me at everything.

433
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,041
Except reading.

434
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,285
They're, um...

435
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,287
They're ready for you.

436
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,326
He's wanted to hang me for a while.
Now's his chance.

437
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,041
No one's going to hang you.
You've done nothing wrong.

438
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,043
I've done plenty wrong.

439
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,084
So you admit you murdered Qhorin Half hand?

440
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,971
- I didn't murder him.
- No?

441
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,044
You put your sword
through a brother of the Night's Watch.

442
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,043
What do you call that?

443
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,363
He wanted me to kill him.

444
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,250
A bastard son of a traitor.
What would you expect?

445
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,611
The Half hand believed our only chance to
stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.

446
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,963
Don't talk about the Half hand
as if you knew him. He was my brother.

447
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,801
Then you'd know he'd do anything
to defend the Wall.

448
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,566
The free folk would have boiled him alive,
but letting me kill him...

449
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,802
The free folk? Listen to him.

450
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,169
He even talks like a wildling now.

451
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,891
Aye, I talk like a wildling.
I ate with the wildlings.

452
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,884
I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I...

453
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,001
I laid with a wildling girl.

454
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,689
You admit to breaking your vows, then?

455
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,121
I do.

456
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,127
The law is the law.

457
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,325
The boy must die.

458
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,246
If we beheaded every ranger
who lay with a girl,

459
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,849
the Wall would be manned by headless men.

460
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:27,170
There's a difference between
sneaking off to the Mole's Town brothel

461
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,368
and sleeping with the enemy.

462
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,602
While we sit here
debating which rules I broke,

463
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,404
Mance Rayder marches on the Wall
with an army of 100,000.

464
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,405
Impossible.

465
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,768
You can't get 50 wildlings together
before they start killing each other.

466
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,046
100,000.

467
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,883
He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots,
the ice-river clans.

468
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,291
He has giants fighting for him.

469
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,600
Giants?

470
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,808
Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?

471
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,326
I commanded the City Watch
of King's Landing, boy.

472
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,447
And now you're here.

473
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,851
You must not have been
very good at your job.

474
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,241
How dare you?

475
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,129
There's a band of wildlings south of the
Wall already, led by Tormund Giantsbane.

476
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,521
I killed their warg and three others.

477
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,728
They shot me full of arrows.

478
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,846
Their orders are to attack Castle Black from
the south when Mance hits it from the north.

479
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,730
The signal for the attack
will be a bonfire.

480
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,565
Mance said it would be the greatest fire
the North has ever seen.

481
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,090
That's the truth.

482
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,090
All the truth.

483
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,967
Do you intend to execute me,
or am I free to go?

484
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,402
None of us are free.

485
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,164
We are men of the Night's Watch.

486
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,441
But we won't be taking your head today,
Jon Snow.

487
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,887
Go on.

488
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,282
I am acting commander here, Maester Aemon.

489
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,761
Yes, you are.

490
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,081
And I don't trust the bastard.

491
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,764
He told the truth.

492
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,282
And you always know
when a man's telling a lie?

493
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,091
How did you acquire this magical power?

494
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,008
I grew up in King's Landing.

495
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,843
No.

496
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,968
You're a queen, not an ox.

497
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:28,360
Your grandfather gave me a necklace
just like this one for my 51 st nameday.

498
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,884
The wedding is in a fortnight, Grandmother.

499
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,889
You can't say no to everything.

500
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,201
Nonsense. My little dears,

501
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,530
go and speak
to the jewellers of King's Landing.

502
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,161
Tell them who you are, who sent you.

503
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,968
The one who brings me the best necklace
will get to keep the next best.

504
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,803
The Margaery Tyrell who walks into the Sept
a fortnight from now

505
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,723
will inspire a thousand songs.

506
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,085
How sad it will be
if she's wearing rubbish like that.

507
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,323
Perhaps I should just let Joffrey
choose it for me.

508
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,926
End up with a string of dead sparrow heads
around my neck.

509
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,129
You watch that. Even here, with me.

510
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,531
My word.

511
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,084
My lady.

512
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,602
Please pardon me for interrupting.

513
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,091
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

514
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,730
We know who you are.
We've heard all about you.

515
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,201
But hearing is one thing.

516
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,967
Aren't you just marvellous!

517
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,047
Absolutely singular.

518
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,608
I hear you knocked my grandson into the
dirt, like the silly little boy he is.

519
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,291
My lady, I know this is a very busy time
for you, but if I could just have a moment.

520
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,245
You dare not refuse.

521
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,691
A shadow?

522
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,764
With the face of Stannis Baratheon.

523
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,321
I swear to you by all the
gods it was Stannis.

524
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,841
He plunged his sword through Renly's heart
and disappeared.

525
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,971
One day, I will avenge our king.

526
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,042
Joffrey is our king now.

527
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,090
- I meant no offence.
- And you've given none.

528
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,769
All the Kingsguard will be on duty.

529
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,763
Ser Boros will be stationed here.

530
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:32,721
Ser Preston will be stationed here,
beside the primary entertainment.

531
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,085
- Your Grace?
- Huh?

532
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,768
One guard at the thing. Go on.

533
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,284
Ser Meryn will guard
Lady Margaery and Tommen.

534
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,129
I've always guarded the King himself,
my lord. Ever since your absence.

535
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,690
And I thank you for it, Ser Meryn.

536
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,604
All very good. I don't expect any trouble.

537
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,325
The people love their King.
They know who keeps them fed.

538
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,084
Margaery Tyrell, I've heard.

539
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,251
By my leave.

540
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,530
They know I saved the city. I won the war.

541
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,443
The war's not won. Not while Stannis lives.

542
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,921
I broke Stannis on the Blackwater.

543
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,522
Pity you weren't there to help, Uncle.

544
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,126
My apologies, Your Grace.
I was rather busy.

545
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,249
Busy getting captured.

546
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,645
So this is the famous Book of Brothers?

547
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,849
All the great deeds
of all the great Kingsguard.

548
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,408
Ser Arthur Dayne. The Sword of the Morning.

549
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,361
Led the attack
on the Kingswood Brotherhood.

550
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,886
Defeated the Smiling
Knight in single combat.

551
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,650
Ser Duncan the Tall.

552
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,327
Four pages.

553
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,482
- He must have been quite a man.
- So they say.

554
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,327
Ser Jaime Lannister.

555
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,007
Hmm.

556
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,005
Someone forgot to write down
all your great deeds.

557
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,687
- There's still time.
- Is there?

558
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,164
For a 40-year-old knight with one hand?

559
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,768
How can you protect me with that?

560
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,126
I use my left hand now, Your Grace.

561
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,002
Makes for more of a contest.

562
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,323
Have you ever been to Meereen?

563
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,051
Several times, Your Grace,
with Master Kraznys.

564
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,207
And?

565
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,724
They say a thousand slaves died
building the Great Pyramid of Meereen.

566
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,441
And now an army of former slaves
is marching to her gates.

567
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,166
You think the Great Masters are worried?

568
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,007
If they're smart, Your Grace.

569
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,764
You were told to ride at
the back of the train.

570
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,887
Yes, My Queen.

571
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,803
But I need to speak to you
about something important.

572
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,689
A matter of strategy.

573
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,006
Your Grace.

574
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,208
All right, what is this matter of strategy?

575
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,085
A dusk rose.

576
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,330
Would you like to walk at the back
of the train instead of riding?

577
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,051
And this one's called lady's lace.

578
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,566
Would you like to walk without shoes?

579
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,244
You have to know a land to rule it.

580
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,923
Its plants, its rivers,
its roads, its people.

581
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,522
Dusk rose tea eases fever.

582
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,284
Everyone in Meereen knows that.

583
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,601
Especially the slaves
who have to make the tea.

584
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,685
If you want them to follow you,
you have to become a part of their world.

585
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,007
Strategy.

586
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,448
Harpy's Gold.

587
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,646
No tea from this one.

588
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,088
Beautiful but poisonous.

589
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,365
You are a gambler, aren't you?

590
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,851
Your Grace.

591
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,568
There's one on every mile marker
between here and Meereen.

592
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,371
How many miles are there?

593
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,208
163, Your Grace.

594
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,003
I'll tell our men to ride ahead
and bury them.

595
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,487
You don't need to see this.

596
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,728
You will do no such thing.

597
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,162
I will see each and every
one of their faces.

598
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,931
Remove her collar before you bury her.

599
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,689
There she is.

600
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,524
Yes.

601
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,602
- And?
- You made a promise.

602
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,444
To return the Stark girls to their mother,
who is now dead.

603
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,931
To keep them safe.

604
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,283
Arya Stark hasn't been seen
since her father was killed.

605
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,840
Where do you think she is?
My money's on dead.

606
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,130
There's a certain safety in death,
wouldn't you say?

607
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,885
And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister.

608
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,481
Bit of a complication.

609
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,928
A complication
does not release you from a vow.

610
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,967
What do you want me to do?

611
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:52,045
Kidnap my sister-in-law? And take her
where? Where would she be safer than here?

612
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,042
Look me in the eye and tell me that
you think she'll be safe in King's Landing.

613
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,484
Are you sure we're not related?

614
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,647
Ever since I've returned,

615
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,326
every Lannister I've seen
has been a miserable pain in my ass.

616
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,401
Maybe you're a Lannister, too.

617
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,401
You've got the hair for
it, if not the looks.

618
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,764
It's all right.

619
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,282
- You're drunk.
- Yes.

620
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,726
I have good reason to be.

621
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,610
Once I was a knight. Now I'm only a fool.

622
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,650
Don't you know me?

623
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,921
Ser Dontos. The King's nameday celebration.

624
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,562
I'm sorry. I should have remembered.

625
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,245
I can't accept your apology.

626
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:37,128
I may be a fool,
but I'm a living fool, thanks to you.

627
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,605
Anyone would have done the same.

628
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,568
But only you did.

629
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,291
I can never repay you. You gave me my life.

630
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:50,489
But this is worth more than my life.

631
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,645
It belonged to my mother,
and her mother before her.

632
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,604
House Hollard was strong once.

633
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,170
House on the rise.

634
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,722
That's all that's left of those days,
thanks to a few sad, fat drunks like me.

635
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,406
I can't take it.

636
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,606
It's very kind of you, but I can't.

637
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,682
I don't have anything else left.

638
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,131
That's all.

639
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,249
Take it. Wear it.

640
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,921
Let my name
have one more moment in the sun

641
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,729
before it disappears from the world.

642
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,051
I'll wear it with pride, Ser Dontos.

643
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,881
Yeah.

644
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,165
When am I
going to get a horse of my own?

645
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,961
The little lady wants a pony.

646
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,247
The little lady wants
away from your stench.

647
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,087
Horses aren't easy to come by.

648
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,371
Even if they were, you think
I'm gonna put you on your own horse?

649
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:16,684
Watch the only thing of value
I've got in the world ride away?

650
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,524
Why don't you have any money?

651
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,405
Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey
before you left?

652
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,527
No.

653
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,851
You're not very smart, are you?

654
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,365
I'm not a thief.

655
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,809
You're fine with murdering little boys,
but thieving is beneath you?

656
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,609
A man's got to have a code.

657
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,691
You think I'm gonna escape?

658
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,683
Where would I go?

659
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:43,209
I'd be dead by nightfall without you.
My family's gone. I've got no one.

660
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:47,249
You've got an aunt in the Vale.
Your rich Aunt Lysa.

661
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,844
After I sell you to her,

662
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,323
maybe she'll have enough left over
to buy you that pony you want so much.

663
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,361
I'm hungry. You're hungry.

664
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,969
Five horses, five men.

665
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,009
More than I feel like killing
on an empty stomach.

666
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,961
I know him.

667
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,321
The small one. His name is Polliver.

668
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,247
He captured us and took us to Harrenhal.

669
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,364
He killed Lommy.

670
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,371
What the fuck's a Lommy?

671
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,290
He was my friend.

672
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,766
Polliver stole my sword
and put it right through his neck.

673
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,446
He's still got it.

674
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,166
Got what?

675
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,083
My sword Needle.

676
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,446
Needle?

677
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,049
Of course you named your sword.

678
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,326
Lots of people name their swords.

679
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,090
Lots of cunts.

680
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,931
What are you... Get back...

681
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,287
My brother gave me that sword.

682
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,203
- Get back here.
- He killed my friend.

683
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,769
I don't care if he ate your friend.

684
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,205
We're not going in there.

685
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,960
Come on, give it up.

686
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,441
Come here.

687
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,320
- Let's have a feel, eh?
- Leave it.

688
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,086
Come here.

689
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,284
Please, she's a good girl.

690
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,010
Shut your mouth and pour us more ale,

691
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,687
and we may not take her with us
when we're done with her.

692
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,051
I know you.

693
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,526
You're the Hound.

694
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,570
Pour our new friend some ale.

695
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,364
What brings you so far north?

696
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,171
I could ask the same of you.
What are you doing up here?

697
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,810
Just keeping the King's peace.

698
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,609
No need. The war's over.

699
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:29,043
So I've heard.
Stannis defeated at the Blackwater.

700
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,770
Robb Stark killed at the Twins.

701
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,120
And where am I for all of it?

702
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,768
Stuck with your brother.

703
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,002
- Meaning no offence.
- None taken.

704
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,050
He's good, the Mountain is.
Best at what he does.

705
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,442
But torture, torture.

706
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,487
You spend enough time
putting the hammer to people,

707
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,404
you start to feel like a carpenter
making chairs.

708
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,369
Drains the fun right out of it.

709
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,680
And what's life without a little fun?

710
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,204
But I don't need to tell you that, eh?

711
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,087
She's all right. I've had better.

712
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,165
You know what?

713
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,128
You should come with us.

714
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,484
His kind, they've always got
something hidden away somewhere.

715
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,411
Gold, silver, more daughters.

716
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,927
Always something
if you know how to make them talk.

717
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,765
And there's plenty of him
between here and King's Landing.

718
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,205
You could do well for yourself.

719
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,169
We certainly have been.

720
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,650
- I'm not going to King's Landing.
- Think about it.

721
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,690
We could do whatever we like,
wherever we go.

722
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,442
These are the King's colours.

723
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,602
No one's standing in his way now.

724
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,126
Which means no one's standing in ours.

725
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,486
Fuck the King.

726
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:01,931
When I heard that Joffrey's dog had tucked tail
and run from the Battle of the Blackwater,

727
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,084
I didn't believe it.

728
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,641
- But here you are.
- Here I am.

729
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,483
Bring me one of those chickens.

730
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,882
- You got money to pay for it?
- You paid for it?

731
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,087
No.

732
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,727
But we're the King's men.

733
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,162
So, you got money?

734
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,325
Not a penny.

735
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,241
I'll still take that chicken.

736
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,290
Tell you what.

737
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,885
We'll trade you.

738
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,327
One of our little chickens
for one of yours.

739
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,050
Give us a go at your friend.

740
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,926
Lowell there likes them a bit broken in.

741
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,964
You're a talker.

742
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,604
Listening makes me thirsty.

743
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,251
And hungry.

744
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,247
Think I'll take two chickens.

745
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,482
You don't understand the situation.

746
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:29,609
I understand that if any more words
come pouring out your cunt mouth,

747
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:34,729
I'm gonna have to eat every fucking chicken
in this room.

748
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,167
You lived your life for the King.

749
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,964
You're gonna die for some chickens?

750
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,931
Someone is.

751
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,406
Something wrong with your leg, boy?

752
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,603
What do you mean?

753
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,445
Can you walk? I've got to carry you?

754
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,286
Carry me?

755
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,331
Fine little blade.

756
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,129
Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.

1
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,681
Tansy!

2
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,326
Tansy!

3
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,244
Tansy!

4
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,284
Tansy!

5
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,010
There you are.

6
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,924
I can't see her. Tansy!

7
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,571
Tansy!

8
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,407
If you make it out of the woods, you win!

9
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,564
Run, Tansy!

10
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,524
- Tansy!
- Where is she?

11
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,568
Tansy!

12
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,367
Good girls. Down.

13
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,208
Well done. You, too.

14
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,090
- I only wounded her.
- You brought her down. That's what matters.

15
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,881
A fine shot. Wasn't it, Reek?

16
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,486
- A fine shot, master. My lady.
- Please, my lord.

17
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,922
- It hurts. Please.
- Sweet. Don't cry.

18
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,085
It will be over soon.

19
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,368
She thinks she's pretty.

20
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,646
Let me put one through her face.

21
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,370
We have to
reward the hounds, love.

22
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,605
- They did all the hard work.
- Why? I did whatever you asked.

23
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,603
But you made Myranda feel jealous.

24
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,763
- Me, jealous of her?
- My lord, please.

25
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,645
You can see that your presence
has become a bit of a problem.

26
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,928
Rip her!

27
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,684
Rip her!

28
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,727
Not so pretty now.

29
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,251
Your new hand,
it's nicer than the old one.

30
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,567
Wouldn't you agree, Pod?

31
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,006
- Is it solid gold?
- Gilded steel.

32
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,042
You're not eating. Why is no one eating?

33
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,521
My wife wastes away
and my brother starves himself.

34
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,491
- I'm not hungry.
- You lost a hand, not a stomach.

35
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,441
Try the boar.

36
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,127
Cersei can't get enough of it
since one killed Robert for her.

37
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,925
A toast.

38
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,446
To the proud Lannister children.

39
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,608
The dwarf, the cripple,
and the mother of madness.

40
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,846
- I'll clean it up.
- No, I'll do it. Leave us.

41
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,923
It's only wine.

42
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,085
I can't fight any more.

43
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,721
What about your left?

44
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,082
I can hold a sword,
but all my instincts are wrong.

45
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,604
How can I protect the King
when I can hardly wipe my own ass?

46
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,131
You're the Lord Commander now.

47
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,451
Command. Let others do the fighting.

48
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,444
When was the last time Father used a sword?

49
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,608
I'm not Father. I'm the Kingslayer.

50
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,127
When people find out I
can't slay a pigeon...

51
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,247
Train, then.

52
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,881
- Learn to fight with your other hand.
- With whom? You?

53
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,606
Men talk.

54
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,002
As soon as someone discovers I can't fight,
he'll tell everyone.

55
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,726
You need a proper, discreet swordsman.

56
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,642
I have just the one.

57
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,931
My brother tells me
you can keep your mouth shut.

58
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,401
Unusual talent for a sellsword.

59
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,121
He tells me you shit gold,
just like your father.

60
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,164
Is this place safe?

61
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,241
There's this knight, Leygood.
Got thunderbolts on his shield.

62
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,361
Uh-huh.

63
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,240
Right here is where I fuck his wife.

64
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,562
She's a screamer, that one.

65
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,802
If they don't hear her, they won't hear us.

66
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,247
I've never seen Valyrian steel
before. She's a beauty.

67
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,250
Problem is,

68
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,210
if you fight with an edged
blade, I'll have to.

69
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,882
And if I fight with an edged blade,

70
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,803
I'll have no one left to pay me.

71
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,682
I haven't used a sparring sword
since I was nine.

72
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,526
Mmm-mmm.

73
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,051
Bold warrior you are,
attacking a man when his guard's down.

74
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,121
Best time to attack a man.

75
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,164
Mind yourself.

76
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,807
- If I still had my right hand...
- Plan on growing it back?

77
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,491
Come on, then.

78
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,486
Open the gates!

79
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,444
Riders coming in!

80
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,160
Let's get these horses seen to!

81
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,882
Father. Welcome home.

82
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,610
Walda, this is Ramsay Snow, my bastard.

83
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,249
A pleasure, Mother.

84
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,921
Hello.

85
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,571
See that the horses are fed,
watered, and rubbed down.

86
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,120
And take Lady Walda to her chambers.

87
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,847
This way, my lady.

88
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,969
Where is your prize?

89
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,480
With the hounds.

90
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,609
I'll have a look at him.

91
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,127
I hear you took a hand from the Kingslayer.

92
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,044
Word travels. How he screamed.

93
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,122
You would have loved it.

94
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,325
Father.

95
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,930
What did you do to him?

96
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,206
I trained him.

97
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,045
He was a slow learner, but he learned.

98
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,045
- You flayed him.
- Peeled a few bits.

99
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,844
Removed a few others.

100
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,081
This was Balon Greyjoy's son and heir.

101
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,084
We've been flaying our enemies
for 1,000 years.

102
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,685
The flayed man is on our banners.

103
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,683
My banners, not yours.

104
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,330
You're not a Bolton. You're a Snow.

105
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,761
Tywin Lannister has given me the North.

106
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,207
But he won't lift a finger
to help me take it.

107
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,964
As long as the ironborn hold Moat Cailin,

108
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,283
our armies are trapped south of the Neck.

109
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,730
Theon was a valuable hostage,
not your plaything.

110
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,166
I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin.

111
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,010
I already asked.

112
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,487
Lord Greyjoy refused.

113
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,681
Savages have no...

114
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,650
You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy
without my consent?

115
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,688
You made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort.

116
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,961
I acted.

117
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,882
I had to smuggle myself into my own lands,
thanks to the Greyjoys.

118
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,407
I needed Theon whole.

119
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,282
Theon was our enemy.

120
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,361
But Reek

121
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,842
will never betray us.

122
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,521
I placed far too much trust in you.

123
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,441
Reek, how could you let me stand
before my father unshaven?

124
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,844
- It's disrespectful.
- Sorry, my lord.

125
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,882
Give him the razor.

126
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,203
I'm not a Bolton, Father.
What does it matter?

127
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,045
Go on, Reek.

128
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,441
A nice close shave.

129
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,807
Reek,

130
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,645
tell Father,

131
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,601
where are Bran and Rickon Stark?

132
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,281
I don't know, my lord.

133
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,126
You murdered them

134
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,290
and displayed their corpses at Winterfell.

135
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,840
Reek,

136
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,211
did you murder the Stark boys?

137
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,009
No, my lord.

138
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,206
Just two farm boys.

139
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,963
And crisped them
so no one would know?

140
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,883
Yes, my lord.

141
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,088
The Starks have always ruled the North.

142
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,208
If Bran and Rickon are alive,

143
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,647
the country will rally to their side,

144
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,241
now that Robb Stark is gone.

145
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,290
Oh, that's right, Reek.

146
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,330
Robb Stark is dead.

147
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,886
Sorry.

148
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,404
I know he was like a brother to you.

149
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,207
But my father put a knife
through his heart.

150
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,768
How do you feel about that?

151
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,528
- You ready for a hunt?
- Always.

152
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,002
Find those boys and I'll give
you 1,000 acres and a holdfast.

153
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,081
Your pet rat have any thoughts
on which way they went after Winterfell?

154
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,330
Jon Snow is at Castle Black.

155
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,843
Who the fuck is Jon Snow?

156
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,809
Their bastard brother.

157
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,644
He could be sheltering them.

158
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,960
He may know where they are.

159
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,646
Even if he doesn't, he's
half Stark himself.

160
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,767
Could be a threat.

161
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,122
You want to prove yourself a Bolton?

162
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,731
Gather whatever men you can
and ride for Moat Cailin.

163
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,766
Bring this creature of yours.

164
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,242
Maybe he'll be of some use.

165
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,403
Take the Moat for the
family, for our family,

166
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,041
and I'll reconsider your position.

167
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,444
Lord Varys. Breakfasting with the King?

168
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,888
I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome
at such exclusive affairs.

169
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,047
Oh, to be foreign.

170
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,724
Shae has been noticed.

171
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,009
Sansa's maid saw you with her.
She already told your sister.

172
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,890
It's only a matter of time
before your father hears.

173
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,531
So I'm guilty of being seen with
my own wife's handmaiden.

174
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,047
My father will ask you if there's anything
more, and you'll tell him some clever lie.

175
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,009
No, I will not.

176
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,845
How long do you imagine
your father and sister would let me live

177
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,321
if they suspected me of lying?

178
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,846
I have no pet sellsword to protect me.

179
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,962
No legendary brother to avenge me.

180
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,567
Only little birds who whisper in my ear.

181
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,529
Forgive me if I don't weep for you.

182
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,922
No one weeps for spiders, or whores.

183
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,241
I have friends across the sea
who could help her.

184
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,685
She won't leave.

185
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,282
I've told her this is a dangerous place
so many times, she no longer believes it.

186
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,569
Your father has promised to hang
the next whore he finds you with.

187
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,883
Have you ever known your father
to make an idle threat?

188
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,167
From House Tyrell
and the people of the Reach,

189
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,327
Your Grace, it is my honour
to present you with this wedding cup.

190
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,761
May you and my daughter Margaery
drink deep and live long.

191
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,642
A handsome goblet, my lord.

192
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,722
Or shall I call you Father?

193
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,002
I should be honoured, Your Grace.

194
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,161
She's the whore I told you about.

195
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,844
The dark-haired one.

196
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,928
Have her brought to the Tower of the Hand
before the wedding.

197
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,001
Hmm.

198
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,400
A book?

199
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,686
The Lives of Four Kings.

200
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,446
Grand Maester Kaeth's history of
the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon,

201
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,040
Baelor the Blessed,

202
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,568
Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good.

203
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,365
A book every king should read.

204
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,530
Now that the war is won,

205
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,329
we should all find time for wisdom.

206
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,884
Thank you, Uncle.

207
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,202
One of only two Valyrian steel swords
in the capital, Your Grace,

208
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,601
freshly forged in your honour.

209
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,929
Careful, Your Grace.

210
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,241
Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel.

211
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,368
So they say.

212
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,840
Such a great sword should have a name.
What shall I call her?

213
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,967
Stormbringer.

214
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,209
- Terminus.
- Widow's Wail.

215
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,647
- Wolfsbane.
- Widow's Wail. I like that.

216
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,167
Every time I use it,

217
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,607
it'll be like cutting off Ned Stark's head
all over again.

218
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,406
Don't.

219
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,890
You want me on the desk?

220
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,684
- What's wrong, my lion?
- Don't call me that.

221
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,320
What should I call you?

222
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,330
I'm afraid our friendship can't continue.

223
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,210
Our friendship?

224
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,488
There's a ship waiting in the harbour
bound for Pentos.

225
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,001
What?

226
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,491
You'll have your own cabin,

227
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,851
and across the Narrow
Sea a house, servants.

228
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,530
- What is this?
- I'm a married man.

229
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,847
My wife has suffered a great deal,
as you well know.

230
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,801
I don't want her to suffer any more
on my account.

231
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,166
I need to uphold my vows.

232
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,004
She doesn't want you.

233
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,367
- I need to do right by her.
- You don't want her.

234
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,124
By our children.

235
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,601
What are you afraid of?

236
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,330
- I'm not afraid.
- You are.

237
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,042
You are afraid of your
father and your sister.

238
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,646
- You're going to run from them all your life?
- I need you to leave.

239
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,609
I'm not afraid of them.

240
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,489
- I'm not going to run from them.
- Shae.

241
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,408
We will fight them together. It's like
you said, I am yours and you are mine.

242
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,845
You're a whore!

243
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,804
Sansa is fit to bear my children,
and you are not.

244
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,322
I can't be in love with a whore.

245
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,649
I can't have children with a whore.

246
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,725
How many men have you been with?
500? 5,000?

247
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,968
How many whores have you been with?

248
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,162
I have enjoyed my time with all of them,

249
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,402
and I have enjoyed my time
with you most of all.

250
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,528
But now that time is over.

251
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,604
You'll have a comfortable life in Pentos.

252
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,247
Bronn will escort you to your ship.

253
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,406
Hear us now.

254
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,131
Accept these tokens of our faith, my lord,

255
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,045
and lead us from the darkness.

256
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,570
Sire, I served you well.

257
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,881
Lord of Light, show us the way.

258
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,843
- Lead us from the darkness.
- Selyse, you're my sister!

259
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,571
- Yours are the stars that guide us.
- Tell him!

260
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,450
- Tell him!
- Lord of Light, protect us,

261
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,966
for the night is dark and full of terrors.

262
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,481
Did you see? Their souls.

263
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,442
It was their souls.

264
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,444
Our lord took them. Did you see?

265
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,850
Lord Florent was
your brother by law.

266
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,722
He was an infidel.

267
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:06,044
He worshipped the gods of his
fathers and their fathers before him.

268
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,731
They were the gods of your fathers, too.

269
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,168
I ordered him to tear down his idols.
He disobeyed.

270
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,687
How many ships did he bring to your cause?
How many men?

271
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,967
A good deal more than you.

272
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,602
Did you see, Ser Davos?

273
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,571
They're with our lord now.
Their sins all burned away.

274
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,921
I'm sure they're more
than grateful, My Queen.

275
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,006
Meat's off.

276
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,643
Our larders are almost empty.

277
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,848
Serve fish, then. We're on an island.

278
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,604
You hate fish.

279
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,207
I hate a good many things,
but I suffer them all the same.

280
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,927
When Storm's End was under siege
and I was starving,

281
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,041
Stannis boiled soup for me from books.

282
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,247
The binding glue is made from horses.

283
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,688
One morning,
he shot two seagulls on the beach.

284
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,525
I've never tasted anything
as good as grilled seagull.

285
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,410
- Do you remember?
- Of course.

286
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,125
Have you ever known true hunger, my lady?

287
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,083
That's all I knew when I was a child.

288
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,725
Until you found the Lord of Light?

289
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,202
Until he found me.

290
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,364
I fear for our daughter's soul.

291
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,202
Every mother
should fear for her child's soul.

292
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,248
- She's a stubborn little beast.
- She's a child.

293
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,485
You barely know her.

294
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,286
You think she's sweet because
she smiles when you visit.

295
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,727
She's sullen and stubborn and sinful.

296
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,641
Why else would the Lord of Light
have seen fit to mark her face?

297
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,206
She needs the rod.

298
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,602
She's my daughter. You will not strike her.

299
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,641
As you command.

300
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,651
Perhaps the Lady Melisandre
could speak with her.

301
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,526
Come in.

302
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,361
Were you sleeping, Princess?

303
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,128
Did you watch the ceremony on the beach?

304
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,607
I heard it.

305
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,161
And it frightened you?

306
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,205
Ser Axell was my uncle.

307
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,444
He was always kind to me.

308
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,443
They're in a better place now, Princess.

309
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,000
The fire cleansed them
of the sins of the world.

310
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,809
But they screamed.

311
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,326
Women scream when they give birth.

312
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,448
Afterward they are filled with joy.

313
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,284
Afterward they aren't ash and bone.

314
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,362
You have so many questions, don't you?

315
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,525
So did I when I was a child.

316
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,042
I was much like you.

317
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,524
Only I wasn't a princess.

318
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,205
And you didn't have this.

319
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,481
No.

320
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,364
But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl,
believe me.

321
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,491
What do you know of the gods?

322
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,731
I read The Seven-Pointed Star.

323
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,609
Lies and fables.

324
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,362
Septons speak of seven gods.

325
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,124
There are but two.

326
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,521
A god of light and love and joy,

327
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,601
and a god of darkness, evil, and fear.

328
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,091
Eternally at war.

329
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,888
Then there are no seven heavens
and no seven hells?

330
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,687
There's only one hell, Princess.

331
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,842
The one we live in now.

332
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,641
Hodor.

333
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,647
Why did you wake me?

334
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,609
You've been gone for hours.

335
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,005
I was hungry.

336
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,326
We're all hungry.

337
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,121
I was just eating.

338
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,363
Summer was eating.

339
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,970
Your body can't live on the food
your wolf consumes.

340
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,489
Spending too much time in Summer's skin
is dangerous.

341
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,483
You're not a direwolf, Bran.

342
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,005
Must be glorious, though.

343
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,526
To run, to leap, to hunt.

344
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,244
To be whole.

345
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,084
I know it's tempting,

346
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,167
but if you're trapped in Summer for too long,
you'll forget what it was to be human.

347
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,768
You'd forget us, Bran.

348
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:15,125
You'd forget your mother and father,
your brothers and sisters, Winterfell.

349
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,126
You'd forget you.

350
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,121
And if we lose you, we lose everything.

351
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,203
Hodor, take me to the tree.

352
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,003
Look for me

353
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,091
beneath the tree.

354
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,401
He saw us!

355
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,441
North.

356
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,721
I know where we have to go.

357
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,850
Let it be known that
Margaery of House Tyrell

358
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,881
and Joffrey of the Houses
Lannister and Baratheon

359
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,601
are one heart, one flesh, one soul.

360
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,124
Cursed be he
who would seek to tear them asunder.

361
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,084
With this kiss, I pledge my love.

362
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,642
We have a new queen.

363
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,210
Better her than you.

364
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,320
- Bit much, wouldn't you say?
- It feels proportionate.

365
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,483
- Proportionate to what?
- The expected extravagance.

366
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,047
People who spend their money
on this sort of nonsense

367
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,565
tend not to have it for long.

368
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,087
You ought to try enjoying something
before you die.

369
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,889
You might find it suits you.

370
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,169
Not now, Mace.
Lord Tywin and I are speaking.

371
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,481
Anyway, I don't know
what you're complaining about.

372
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,607
I'm paying my share.

373
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,526
Shall we stick golden roses
on half the meat pies

374
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,244
to commemorate your generosity?

375
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,006
No, your heartfelt "Thank you"
is its own reward.

376
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,811
I would imagine
I'll be hearing it again before long.

377
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,167
Wars are rather expensive.

378
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,210
"The Iron Bank will have its due."

379
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,721
How they love to remind everyone.

380
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,451
Almost as much as
you Lannisters with your debts.

381
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,488
I'm not worried about the Iron Bank.

382
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,164
We both know you're smarter than that.

383
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,451
Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love.

384
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,050
All taken care of.

385
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,283
- You saw her board the ship?
- Aye, she's on it.

386
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,805
And you saw the ship sail away?

387
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,644
No one knows she's there
but you, me, and Varys.

388
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,245
How do you know?

389
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,840
Because if someone follows me
without an invitation,

390
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,729
I'm the last person they ever follow.

391
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,643
Was someone following you?

392
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,481
She's gone.

393
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,488
I know you don't want to
believe it, but she is.

394
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,922
Now, go drink until it feels like
you did the right thing.

395
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,486
Hello.

396
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,009
- Hello.
- Not you.

397
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,731
You look exquisite, child.

398
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,371
The wind has been at you, though.

399
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,691
I haven't had the opportunity to tell you

400
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,491
how sorry I was to hear about your brother.

401
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,850
War is war, but killing a man at a wedding,

402
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,731
horrid.

403
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,723
What sort of monster would do such a thing?

404
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,284
As if men need more
reasons to fear marriage.

405
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,600
My lady.

406
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,127
Lord Tyrion, you see?
Not as bad as all that.

407
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,770
Perhaps if your pauper husband

408
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,650
were to sell his mule
and his last pair of shoes,

409
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,451
he might be able to afford to bring you
to Highgarden for a visit.

410
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,649
Now that peace has come
and all is right with the world,

411
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,802
it would do you good to see some of it.

412
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,849
You must excuse me. It's time I
ate some of this food I paid for.

413
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,329
A coat of gold

414
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,721
A coat of red

415
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:06,084
A lion still has claws

416
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,648
And mine are long...

417
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,088
Very good. Off you go.

418
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,967
My love,
why don't we make the announcement?

419
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,604
Everyone.

420
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,921
The Queen would like to say a few words.

421
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,047
We are so fortunate
to enjoy this marvellous food and drink.

422
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,442
Not all among us are so lucky.

423
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,680
To thank the gods for bringing
the recent war to a just end,

424
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,091
King Joffrey has decreed that
the leftovers from our feast

425
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,845
be given to the poorest in his city.

426
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,489
You're an example to us all.

427
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,010
Ser Jaime, I'm very sorry.

428
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,411
Ser Loras, it's quite all right.

429
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,846
Your sister looks very beautiful.

430
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,926
As does yours.

431
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,568
So, are you looking
forward to your wedding?

432
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,244
Yes, very much.

433
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,125
Our fathers are both
rather keen on the prospect.

434
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,204
- They certainly are.
- Perhaps they should get married.

435
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,846
If you were to marry Cersei,
she'd murder you in your sleep.

436
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,921
If you somehow managed
to put a child in her first,

437
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,761
she'd murder him, too,
long before he drew his first breath.

438
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,880
Luckily for you, none of this will happen
because you'll never marry her.

439
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,881
And neither will you.

440
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,929
Your Grace. My King.

441
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,804
- My Queen.
- Lady Brienne.

442
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,131
So good of you to come.

443
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,651
I'm no lady, Your Grace.

444
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,721
Did you just bow?

445
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,129
Apologies, Your Grace.

446
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,770
I never did master the curtsy.

447
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,922
You're the one who put a sword
through Renly Baratheon.

448
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,483
That's not true, my love.
Brienne had nothing to do with it.

449
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,766
A shame.

450
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,201
I'd knight the man that put an end to
that deviant's life.

451
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,009
I just wanted to congratulate you both
and wish you good fortune.

452
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,401
The country has been at war too long.

453
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,366
I hope your reign is long and peaceful.

454
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,090
- Yes.
- Thank you.

455
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,208
I hope we see more of you.

456
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,170
Lady Brienne.

457
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,487
You're Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter.

458
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,006
That makes you a lady
whether you want to be or not.

459
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,363
As you say, Your Grace.

460
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,771
I owe you my gratitude.

461
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,047
You returned my brother safely
to King's Landing.

462
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,531
In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace.

463
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,681
More than once.

464
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,125
Did he?

465
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,451
Haven't heard that story before.

466
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,722
Not such a fascinating story.

467
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,280
I'm sure you have many.

468
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,361
Sworn to Renly Baratheon, Catelyn Stark,
and now my brother.

469
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,883
Must be exciting to flit
from one camp to the next,

470
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,567
serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.

471
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,246
I don't serve your brother, Your Grace.

472
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,291
But you love him.

473
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,170
Your Grace.

474
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,846
No, come to my chambers
and I will examine you personally.

475
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,161
- She'll do no such thing.
- Oh, Your Grace.

476
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,568
This young lady sought my advice...

477
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,290
You should see Qyburn. He's quite good.

478
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,409
- Your Grace.
- Qyburn? Deplorable man.

479
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,569
Brought shame on the Citadel
with his repugnant experiments.

480
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,808
More repugnant than
your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?

481
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,326
Your Grace, I am a man of learning.

482
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,529
My little brother had you sent to
the Black Cells when you annoyed him.

483
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,409
What do you think I could do to you?

484
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,608
I never meant to annoy anyone.

485
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,445
But you are. You're annoying me right now.

486
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,727
Every breath you draw in my presence
annoys me.

487
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,610
So here's what I want you to do.
Leave my presence.

488
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,170
Leave this wedding right now.

489
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,083
Go to the kitchens and instruct them that

490
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,369
all the leftovers from the feast
will be brought to the kennels.

491
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,602
Your Grace, Queen Margaery...

492
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:15,766
The Queen is telling you
the leftovers will feed the dogs,

493
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,370
or you will.

494
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,405
A gold dragon to
whoever knocks my fool's hat off.

495
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,407
You're in rather a good mood.

496
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,884
- I suppose I am.
- I won't ask why.

497
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,804
- Small pleasures.
- Your Grace. Lord Tywin.

498
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,245
Prince Oberyn.

499
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,731
I don't believe you have met Ellaria.

500
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,564
This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister,

501
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,086
and Cersei Lannister, the Queen Regent.

502
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,731
I suppose it is former Queen Regent now.

503
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,163
Lord Hand and Lady Cersei,

504
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,082
- Ellaria Sand.
- My lord. My lady.

505
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,043
Charmed.

506
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,963
Can't say I've ever met a Sand before.

507
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,885
We are everywhere in Dorne.
I have 10,000 brothers and sisters.

508
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,361
Bastards are born of passion, aren't they?

509
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,841
- We don't despise them in Dorne.
- No? How tolerant of you.

510
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,801
I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei,
giving up your regal responsibilities.

511
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,970
Wearing the crown for so many years
must have left your neck a bit crooked.

512
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,281
I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn.

513
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,041
It's a shame your older brother
couldn't attend the wedding.

514
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,528
Please give him our regards.

515
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,843
With any luck, the gout will abate with
time and he will be able to walk again.

516
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,888
They call it the rich man's disease.

517
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,166
A wonder you don't have it.

518
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,890
Noblemen in my part of the country

519
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,248
don't enjoy the same lifestyle
as our counterparts in Dorne.

520
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,084
People everywhere have their differences.

521
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,527
In some places,
the highborn frown upon those of low birth.

522
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,528
In other places,
the rape and murder of women and children

523
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,409
is considered distasteful.

524
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,846
What a fortunate thing for you,
former Queen Regent,

525
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,885
that your daughter Myrcella has been sent
to live in the latter sort of place.

526
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,202
Everyone, silence! Clear the floor.

527
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,531
There's been too much amusement
here today.

528
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,447
A royal wedding is not an amusement.

529
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,851
A royal wedding is history.

530
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,209
Time has come for all of us
to contemplate our history.

531
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,601
My lords,

532
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,964
my ladies,

533
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,725
I give you

534
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,921
King Joffrey,

535
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,606
Renly, Stannis,

536
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,206
Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy!

537
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,164
The War of the Five Kings!

538
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,562
I'm the rightful king.

539
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,247
- King in the North!
- Yes!

540
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,491
Traitor.

541
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,608
You're a traitor.

542
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,921
I'm the King
of the Seven Kingdoms!

543
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,089
Let the war begin.

544
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,562
Renly, you're no king.

545
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,244
Away, degenerate.

546
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,051
Careful.

547
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,327
- Go on.
- I want you to be my prince.

548
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,244
Stannis!

549
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,448
Who's got the gold now, Stark?

550
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,125
I am the rightful king.

551
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,089
Challenge me, kraken.

552
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,730
- Take that.
- I'm drowning!

553
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,131
I am the King in the North!

554
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,122
Not wildfire!

555
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,964
Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done.

556
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,763
Yes, my lord.

557
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,729
We'll have to find another way
to thank the King.

558
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,804
Charge!

559
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,088
Ready? Again.

560
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,689
I am the King in the North!

561
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,484
- Charge!
- Charge!

562
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,160
Yes!

563
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,641
Your head!

564
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,010
Fine gentlemen.

565
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,806
Well fought.

566
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,690
Here you are. Champion's purse.

567
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,965
Though you're not the
champion yet, are you?

568
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:54,250
A true champion defeats
all the challengers.

569
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:59,250
Surely there are others out there
who still dare to challenge my reign.

570
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,241
Uncle.

571
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,889
How about you?
I'm sure they have a spare costume.

572
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,883
One taste of combat was enough for me,
Your Grace.

573
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,167
I would like to keep
what remains of my face.

574
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,409
I think you should fight him.

575
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,521
This was but a poor imitation
of your own bravery on the field of battle.

576
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,921
I speak as a firsthand witness.

577
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,809
Climb down from the high table
with your new Valyrian sword

578
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,168
and show everyone
how a true king wins his throne.

579
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,485
Be careful, though.

580
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,724
This one is clearly mad with lust.

581
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,562
It would be a tragedy for
the King to lose his virtue

582
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,166
hours before his wedding night.

583
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,324
A fine vintage.

584
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,970
Shame that it spilled.

585
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,046
It did not spill.

586
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,360
My love, come back to me.

587
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,970
It's time for my father's toast.

588
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,764
How does he expect me
to toast without wine?

589
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,489
Uncle, you can be my cupbearer

590
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,289
seeing as you're too cowardly to fight.

591
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,685
Your Grace does me a great honour.

592
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,926
It's not meant as an honour.

593
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,800
Bring me my goblet.

594
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,281
What good is an empty cup?

595
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,321
Fill it.

596
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,481
Kneel.

597
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,210
Kneel before your king.

598
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,566
Kneel.

599
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:20,448
I said kneel!

600
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,646
Look, the pie.

601
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,440
My Queen.

602
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,804
Wonderful.

603
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,610
My hero.

604
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,771
- Can we leave now?
- Let's find out.

605
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,721
Uncle.

606
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,806
Where are you going?

607
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,644
You're my cupbearer, remember?

608
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,611
I thought I might change out of
these wet clothes, Your Grace.

609
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,251
No, you're perfect the way you are.

610
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,485
Serve me my wine.

611
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,681
Hurry up. This pie is dry.

612
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,680
Mmm, good.

613
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,289
Needs washing down.

614
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:55,727
If it please Your Grace,

615
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,531
- Lady Sansa is very tired.
- No.

616
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,363
No, you'll wait here...

617
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,846
Your Grace?

618
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,361
It's nothing.

619
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,371
- He's choking!
- Help the poor boy.

620
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,885
- Idiots, help your king.
- Move away!

621
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,406
- Joffrey!
- Help him!

622
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,242
- Someone help him!
- Joffrey!

623
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,446
- Come with me now.
- Joffrey!

624
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,128
If you want to live, we have to leave.

625
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,401
Don't touch him!

626
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,722
Joffrey.

627
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,808
Please, Joffrey.

628
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:57,204
Joffrey, what is it?

629
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,450
Help him!

630
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:35,001
My son.

631
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,407
He did this.

632
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,405
He poisoned my son,

633
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,084
your king.

634
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,564
Take him!

635
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,128
Take him!

1
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,290
You did this!

2
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,364
- We have to leave.
- Take him!

3
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,970
Where is his wife?

4
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,767
Where's Sansa?

5
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,323
Find her. Bar the gates of the city.
Seize every ship in the harbour.

6
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,609
- Where is she?
- No one leaves the capital!

7
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,845
Get in.

8
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,331
- Where are we going?
- Somewhere safe.

9
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,643
Up you go, my lady.

10
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,965
You'll be fine.

11
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,327
You're stronger than you know.

12
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,529
- Lord Baelish?
- Petyr.

13
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,691
Are you hurt, my lady?

14
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,691
Good.

15
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,487
I'm sure you've had quite a fright.
Rest easy.

16
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,050
- The worst is past.
- Lord Baelish.

17
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,011
- I promised I'd get her to you safely.
- Softly, my friend.

18
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,927
Voices carry over water.

19
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,765
I should get back before
someone thinks to look for me.

20
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,968
First you'll want your pay.

21
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,203
- Ten thousand, was it?
- Ten thousand.

22
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,641
Wait!

23
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,724
Shh.

24
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,888
You don't want the Queen to hear, do you?

25
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,930
A thousand gold cloaks
are searching for you.

26
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,002
And if they found you,

27
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,163
how do you think they would punish
the girl who murdered the King?

28
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,129
I didn't murder anyone.

29
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,851
I know. But you must admit,
it looks suspicious.

30
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,922
The King who executed your father,

31
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,162
who tormented you for years,

32
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,766
and you fled the scene of his murder.

33
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,085
Why did you kill him?

34
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,801
Because he was a drunk and a fool,

35
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,724
and I don't trust drunk fools.

36
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,006
He saved me.

37
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,165
Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders.
Every one of them.

38
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,530
And he did it all for gold.

39
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,080
Money buys a man's silence for a time.

40
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,609
A bolt in the heart buys it forever.

41
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,731
He was helping me because I saved his life.

42
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,725
Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace

43
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,930
that once belonged to his grandmother.

44
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,811
The last legacy of House Hollard.

45
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,602
I had it made a few weeks ago.

46
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,084
What did I once tell you about the capital?

47
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,723
"We're all liars here."

48
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,489
Come, my lady.

49
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,801
I know you've had a difficult day.

50
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,522
But you're safe now.

51
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,728
I promise you that.

52
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,565
You're safe with me,

53
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,086
sailing home.

54
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,927
So am I the queen?

55
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,964
More than you were with Renly.

56
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,326
Less than you would have been

57
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,962
if Joffrey had done you the courtesy
of consummating the marriage before dying.

58
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,929
This would not be
an opportune moment to press the issue.

59
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,768
Clawing at his own throat,
looking to his mother to make it stop...

60
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,921
It was horrible.

61
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,321
The world is overflowing
with horrible things.

62
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,004
But they're all a tray
of cakes next to death.

63
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,403
They brought me your grandfather's body
when he died.

64
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,209
Made me look at it.

65
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,765
What was it like?

66
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,969
They took me to the Great Hall.
There he was.

67
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,691
The man I'd married
and suffered to father my children.

68
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,889
A great doughy lump I'd sat next to
at endless dinners and tedious gatherings.

69
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,526
There he was,

70
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,009
lying on a table.

71
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,127
One of my husbands
preferred the company of men

72
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,123
and was stabbed through the heart.

73
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,362
Another was happiest torturing animals

74
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,807
and was poisoned at our wedding feast.

75
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,570
- I must be cursed.
- Nonsense.

76
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,485
Your circumstances have improved markedly.

77
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,245
You may not have enjoyed watching him die,

78
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,129
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

79
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,168
being married to him, I
can promise you that.

80
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,282
But I would have been the queen.

81
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,408
Our alliance with the Lannisters

82
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,927
remains every bit as necessary to them
as it is unpleasant for us.

83
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,326
You did wonderful work on Joffrey.

84
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,728
The next one should be easier.

85
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,930
Your brother is dead.

86
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,002
Do you know what that means?

87
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,401
I'm not trying to trick you.

88
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,289
It means I'll become king.

89
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,569
Yes, you will become king.

90
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,847
What kind of king do you think you'll be?

91
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,362
- A good king?
- Mmm.

92
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,483
I think so as well.

93
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,690
You've got the right temperament for it.

94
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,160
But what makes a good king? Hmm?

95
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,043
What is a good king's
single most important quality?

96
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,088
This is hardly the place or the time.

97
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,122
- Holiness?
- Hmm.

98
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,647
Baelor the Blessed was holy.

99
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,889
And pious.

100
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,644
He built this Sept.

101
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,763
He also named a 6-year-old boy High Septon

102
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,969
because he thought
the boy could work miracles.

103
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,131
He ended up
fasting himself into an early grave

104
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,489
because food was of this world
and this world was sinful.

105
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,607
Hmm.

106
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,283
- Justice.
- Mmm.

107
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,482
A good king must be just.

108
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,490
Orys I was just.

109
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,040
Everyone applauded his reforms,

110
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,122
nobles and commoners alike.

111
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,362
But he wasn't just for long.

112
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,647
He was murdered in his sleep
after less than a year by his own brother.

113
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,889
Was that truly just of him?

114
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,443
To abandon his subjects to an evil that
he was too gullible to recognise?

115
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,808
- No.
- No.

116
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,965
- What about strength?
- Yes.

117
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,281
Strength.

118
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,125
King Robert was strong.

119
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,288
He won the rebellion

120
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,170
and crushed the Targaryen dynasty.

121
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,603
And he attended three Small Council
meetings in 17 years.

122
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,004
He spent his time whoring and hunting
and drinking

123
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,367
until the last two killed him.

124
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,043
So, we have a man
who starves himself to death,

125
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,649
a man who lets his own brother murder him,

126
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,167
and a man who thinks that winning
and ruling are the same thing.

127
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,128
What do they all lack?

128
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,530
- Wisdom.
- Yes!

129
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,286
- Wisdom is what makes a good king.
- Yes.

130
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,251
But what is wisdom? Hmm?

131
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,764
A house with great wealth and fertile lands
asks you for your protection

132
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:55,165
against another house with a strong navy
that could one day oppose you.

133
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,645
How do you know
which choice is wise and which isn't?

134
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,647
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries

135
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,371
or shipyards and soldiers?

136
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,886
- No.
- Of course not.

137
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,289
A wise king knows what he knows
and what he doesn't.

138
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,127
You're young.

139
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:19,887
A wise young king listens to his counsellors
and heeds their advice until he comes of age.

140
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,203
And the wisest kings

141
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,329
continue to listen to them long afterwards.

142
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,765
Your brother was not a wise king.

143
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,328
Your brother was not a good king.

144
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,448
If he had been,

145
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,126
perhaps he'd still be alive.

146
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,170
Now, as the king, you will have to marry.

147
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,645
Do you understand why?

148
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,285
A king needs a queen.

149
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,203
Yes, but why?

150
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,965
To further the family line.

151
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,208
- Do you know how that happens?
- Yes.

152
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,966
But has anyone
explained the details to you?

153
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,610
I don't think so.

154
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,445
It's all relatively straightforward.

155
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,651
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

156
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,529
You are. You will be.

157
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,609
I'll see to that.

158
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,122
Please give the Queen
a moment alone with her son.

159
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,521
- Yes, my lord.
- All of you.

160
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,528
It was Tyrion.

161
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,651
He killed him.

162
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,648
He told me he would.

163
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,170
"A day will come when you
think you are safe and happy,

164
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,801
"and your joy will turn to ashes
in your mouth."

165
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,601
That's what he said to me.

166
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,604
You saw it.

167
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,083
- You saw Joff point at him just before he...
- I don't know what I saw.

168
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,041
Avenge him.

169
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,041
Avenge our son.

170
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,641
Kill Tyrion.

171
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,569
Tyrion's my brother.

172
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,244
Our brother.

173
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,007
There'll be a trial.
We'll get to the truth of what happened.

174
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,526
I don't want a trial.

175
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,922
He'll squirm his way to freedom
given the chance.

176
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,605
I want him dead.

177
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,401
Please, Jaime. You have to.

178
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,007
He was our son.

179
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,082
Our baby boy.

180
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,246
You're a hateful woman.

181
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,681
Why have the gods made me
love a hateful woman?

182
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,246
Jaime, not here, please.

183
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,850
Please.

184
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,761
Stop it.

185
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,968
- Stop it.
- No.

186
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,441
Stop it.

187
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,001
Stop.

188
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,481
Stop. It's not right.

189
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,127
It's not right.

190
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,202
I don't care.

191
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,731
- Don't.
- I don't care.

192
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,009
- Jaime, don't.
- I don't care.

193
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,729
Gonna rain soon.

194
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,044
Where are we?

195
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,160
Near Fairmarket, I think.

196
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,641
You think?

197
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,210
You don't have a map?

198
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,329
- No.
- Maybe we should get one.

199
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,483
Just point out the next map shop
you see, and I'll buy you one.

200
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,643
- How far is it to the Eyrie?
- Far.

201
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,245
And you're sure we're going the right way?

202
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,847
Believe me, girl,
I want you there as soon as I can.

203
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,366
Get my gold, be on my way.

204
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,125
- Where?
- Why do you care?

205
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,963
Might book passage across the Narrow Sea.

206
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,889
Fight as a sellsword.

207
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,647
Second Sons, could be.

208
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,802
Seems like a good fit for me.

209
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,445
I'd like to see Braavos one day.

210
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,726
Why Braavos?

211
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,561
I have friends there.

212
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,724
I doubt it.

213
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,331
Seven blessings to you.

214
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,843
- What do you want?
- This is my land.

215
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,968
If I'm standing on it, it's my land.

216
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,203
We were just watering the horses.
We'll be on our way.

217
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,250
Forgive my father.

218
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,687
He was wounded fighting in the war.

219
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,809
Our cottage burned down while he was gone,
and my mother with it.

220
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,205
He's never been the same.

221
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,966
Which house did he fight for?

222
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,290
The Tullys of Riverrun.

223
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,125
There's a storm coming.

224
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,690
You'll be wanting a roof tonight.

225
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,889
There's fresh hay in the barn.

226
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,850
And Sally here makes rabbit stew
just like her mom used to do.

227
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,685
We don't have much, but any man that
bled for House Tully is welcome to it.

228
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,323
We ask the Father to judge us
with mercy, accepting our human frailty.

229
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,449
We ask the Mother to bless our crops,

230
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,569
so we may feed ourselves
and all who come to our door.

231
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,850
We ask the Warrior to give us courage
in these days of strife and turmoil.

232
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,207
We ask the Maiden to protect Sally's virtue

233
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,930
and keep her from the
clutches of depravity.

234
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,764
You going to do all seven of the fuckers?

235
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,167
Father!

236
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,684
We ask the Smith to strengthen our hands
and our backs,

237
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,922
so we may finish the work required of us.

238
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,011
We ask the Crone to guide us on our journey
from darkness to darkness.

239
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,642
And we ask the Stranger not to kill us in
our beds tonight for no damn reason at all.

240
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,691
I'm so sorry.

241
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,721
Really good.

242
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,606
Did you fight at the Twins?

243
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,241
Call that a fight?
Slaughtering livestock more like.

244
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,091
The Red Wedding, they're calling it.

245
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,288
Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day.

246
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,722
He shared bread and salt with the Starks.
He offered them guest right.

247
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,802
Guest right don't mean much any more.

248
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,167
It means something to me.

249
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,248
The gods will have their vengeance.

250
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,643
Frey will burn in the seventh hell
for what he did.

251
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,845
Things were different
when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands.

252
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,208
We had good years and bad years,
same as anyone, but we were safe.

253
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,443
Now with the Freys,

254
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,320
raiders come plundering,
steal our food, steal our silver.

255
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,528
I was gonna send Sally north
to stay with my brother,

256
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,604
but the North's no better.
The whole country's gone sour.

257
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,446
You got any ale?

258
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,490
Afraid not.

259
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,088
How can a man not keep ale in his home?

260
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,205
You look like
you could really swing that sword.

261
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,442
A real warrior with proper training.

262
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,645
Those raiders wouldn't
stand a chance against you.

263
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,248
How would it be
if you stayed on till the new moon?

264
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,120
I could use a man to
help with the farm work.

265
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,521
Sally does what she can,

266
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,204
but she can't lift a bale of hay.

267
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,002
And if any thieves came
looking for easy pickings,

268
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,845
one look at you,
I bet they'd run the other way.

269
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,131
Meaning no offence.

270
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,445
What'll you pay?

271
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,521
I don't have much.

272
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,921
But I have hidden a bit of silver
from the bandits.

273
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,801
Fair wages for fair work?

274
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,530
Fair wages for fair work.

275
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,766
Ahhh!

276
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,680
- What did you do?
- Get your horse saddled.

277
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,684
- You told me you weren't a thief.
- I wasn't.

278
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,331
He took us in. He fed us and you...

279
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,882
Aye, he took us in. He's a good man,
and his daughter makes a nice stew.

280
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,849
And they'll both be dead come winter.

281
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,207
- You don't know that.
- I do.

282
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,443
He's weak. He can't protect himself.

283
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,801
They'll both be dead come winter.

284
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,405
Dead men don't need silver.

285
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,971
You're the worst shit
in the Seven Kingdoms.

286
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,967
There's plenty worse than me.

287
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,725
I just understand the way things are.

288
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,610
How many Starks they got to behead
before you figure it out?

289
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,129
Raper.

290
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,645
Horse thief.

291
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,370
Ninth-born son.

292
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,846
Raper. Thief.

293
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,922
Thief and raper.

294
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,446
There he is, Sam the Slayer.

295
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,841
Going to visit your wildling whore?

296
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,649
- She's not a whore.
- No?

297
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,087
Maybe I'll give her a copper tonight
and find out.

298
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,648
They all think I'm lying.

299
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,609
About what?

300
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,682
Killing the White Walker.

301
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,330
You're not lying.

302
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,043
I'll never forget the way it screamed.

303
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,163
But you're the only one that saw it.

304
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,844
And they all think you're just a...

305
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,081
A what?

306
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,130
A wildling.

307
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,283
My father hated that word.

308
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,965
- It's not a very nice word.
- I don't know.

309
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,248
It makes me sound a bit dangerous,
doesn't it?

310
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,882
So, are you all right?

311
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,361
No one bothering you?

312
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,249
I get a lot of looks.

313
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,243
I hear them making their jokes.

314
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,164
But no one's touched me,
if that's what you mean.

315
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,328
I worry about it sometimes.

316
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,764
All the time.

317
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,607
Why do you worry about it?

318
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,002
One hundred men, one woman.

319
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,526
They've got other things to think about.

320
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,648
That's the only thing they think about.

321
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,929
- You're being silly.
- I'm not being silly.

322
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,846
There's 100 men lying awake at night,
picturing you.

323
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,083
What about you?

324
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,571
What about me?

325
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,205
Gilly?

326
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,523
I worry about you.

327
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,045
Thank you.

328
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,607
For what?

329
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,842
For worrying about me.

330
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,923
I don't know if you're safe here.

331
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,206
They're my brothers,

332
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,647
but some of them were thieves
before they came here.

333
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,848
Some of them were rapers.

334
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,048
You saw what they did
at your father's keep.

335
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,884
So what are you saying?

336
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,882
Maybe you'd be safer in Mole's Town.

337
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,807
Are you bored of me?

338
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,767
Bored of you?

339
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,166
I...

340
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,369
I want to protect you.

341
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,003
I'll get these to Hobb.

342
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,242
Keep an eye on little Sam.

343
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,844
Your Grace.

344
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,284
You're a literary man now.
What do you make of that?

345
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,087
- Joffrey?
- "The usurper, Joffrey Baratheon."

346
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,204
I said those words
when I tossed a leech into the fire,

347
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,966
filled with bastard blood.

348
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,810
A bastard you set free.

349
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,040
I am now faced with a great opportunity,

350
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,963
and I am powerless to take advantage of it.

351
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,166
I will find you an army, Your Grace.

352
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,288
- I've been working day and night...
- What progress have you made?

353
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,170
- I've rallied House Peasebury to your cause.
- House Peasebury.

354
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,331
- House Musgood.
- House Musgood.

355
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,930
- And House Haigh.
- House Haigh.

356
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,407
They don't have enough men between them
to raid a pantry.

357
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,129
Westeros is not the world, Your Grace.

358
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,009
We need to look east for ships and men.

359
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,368
10,000 skilled soldiers
fight for the Golden Company.

360
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,442
- The Golden Company?
- They've never broken a contract.

361
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,521
They're sellswords.

362
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,364
We're willing to use blood magic
to put you on the throne,

363
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,442
but we're not willing to pay men to fight?

364
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,807
Now the Red Woman's magic is real.

365
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,042
Her visions and prophecies may be, too,

366
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,964
but I've never heard of visions
and prophecies winning a war.

367
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,327
Soldiers win wars. Soldiers on the ground.

368
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,606
It's dirty on the ground.

369
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,841
We don't have any gold.

370
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,647
Not yet.

371
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:07,131
If I do not press my claim,
my claim will be forgotten.

372
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,602
I will not become a page
in someone else's history book.

373
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,848
I'm running out of time, Ser Davos.

374
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,882
Which means you're running out of time.

375
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,561
You're late.

376
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,210
I'm sorry, Princess.

377
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,805
I thought you weren't coming.

378
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,121
The Hand of the King
doesn't have much leisure time.

379
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,809
You won't be a very good Hand if you
see the word knight and say "ka-nigit."

380
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,888
That happened once, weeks ago.

381
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,849
You're your father's daughter, no mistake.

382
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,809
Bloody relentless, the both of you.

383
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,366
It's a new one today. Lots of tricky words.

384
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,568
But I think you can manage.

385
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,922
You'll never read well
if you move your lips.

386
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,082
That's how children do it.

387
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,529
"The Life and Adventures of Elyo Grivas

388
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,728
"First Sword of Braavos."

389
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,849
Thank you very much.

390
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,084
I like this one.
It's full of swordfights and pirates.

391
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,643
- You were a pirate once.
- No, I was a smuggler.

392
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,046
What's the difference?

393
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,760
If you're a famous smuggler,
you're not doing it right.

394
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,442
My father says a criminal is a criminal.

395
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,366
Your father lacks an appreciation
of the finer points of bad behaviour.

396
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,725
So do the Braavosi.

397
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,290
- You've sailed to Braavos?
- Of course.

398
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,284
Almost got beheaded by
a First Sword of Braavos.

399
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,651
I tried to explain to him the difference
between pirates and smugglers,

400
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,530
but he didn't seem any more interested
in the distinction than your father.

401
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,203
I suppose if you work
for the Iron Bank of Braavos

402
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,721
and each one of your gold barges
is worth half a kingdom,

403
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:45,005
you tend not to be overly concerned
with the kind of distinction...

404
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,407
- What was that for?
- I need you to write a message.

405
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,482
You should write it yourself.
It's good practice.

406
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,403
It's too important for me.

407
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,404
I need a smart person to do it. Go on.

408
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,605
To the offices of the Iron Bank of Braavos,

409
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:20,241
from Stannis Baratheon,
the one true king of Westeros.

410
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,805
But that's not you.

411
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,564
I need to get their attention.

412
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,211
Go. Write.

413
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,481
He's seen some adventures, hasn't he?

414
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,323
- Precious little thing.
- Thank you.

415
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,131
- What's his name?
- Sam.

416
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,884
Lovely.

417
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,768
- That the daddy?
- No.

418
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,245
Where's the daddy?

419
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,850
He's dead.

420
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,404
Where you from?

421
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,565
North of here.

422
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,722
North of here?

423
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,971
You a fucking wildling?

424
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,244
- Only room and board?
- That's right.

425
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,961
She'll clean and cook
and look after the other girls' babies.

426
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,361
Could find other work for her, too.

427
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,482
- No other work.
- There'd be money.

428
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,085
Give you a piece of it.

429
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,931
No other work.

430
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,085
I promise to come back and visit
whenever I can.

431
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,607
You'll be safer here.

432
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,523
Who's gonna protect you
at Castle Black? Me?

433
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,809
You protected me north of the Wall.

434
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,803
This is different.

435
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,327
They're brothers of the Night's Watch,
and I can't just stab them in the back.

436
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,324
And I can't run away,
which is what we did at Craster's.

437
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,806
You have to trust me.

438
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,685
It's for the best.

439
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,400
Best for you.

440
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,803
Oh, Gilly.

441
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,121
Please don't...

442
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,368
Greedy.

443
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,564
No?

444
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,326
I'm sorry. You're lovely,
I just never acquired the taste.

445
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,368
You're calling my beauty an acquired taste?

446
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,602
That's quite all right, lover.
There's more for you.

447
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,688
Your loss.

448
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,800
You like them both the same?
Boys and girls?

449
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,531
- Does that surprise you?
- Everyone has a preference.

450
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,206
Then everyone is missing
half the world's pleasure.

451
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,202
The gods made that, and it delights me.

452
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,009
The gods made this,

453
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,081
and it delights me.

454
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,161
When it comes to war, I fight for Dorne.

455
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,881
When it comes to love,
I don't choose sides.

456
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,167
I hope I have as much stamina
when I'm your age.

457
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,969
What are you, 25?

458
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,327
Children.

459
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,486
Someday, if you're lucky,
you will wake up and realise you are old.

460
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,683
That pretty ass of yours will sag,

461
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,969
your belly will grow soft,
and your back will ache in the night,

462
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,930
and grey hairs will sprout from your ears.

463
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,408
No one will want you any more.

464
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,564
Make sure you've fucked your fill
before that day.

465
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,650
Did you?

466
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,409
He is a prince of Dorne.

467
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:54,805
Girls and boys will line up to fuck him
till the day he dies.

468
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,523
They will all have to line up behind you.

469
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,560
- Prince Oberyn.
- Lord Tywin.

470
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,563
May we have the room?

471
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,560
Call my name if you need me, lover.

472
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,051
Would you like to sit?

473
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,050
No, thank you.

474
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,849
- Some wine?
- No, thank you.

475
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,722
I'm sorry about your grandson.

476
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,801
Are you?

477
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,487
I don't believe that a child is responsible
for the sins of his father.

478
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,967
Or his grandfather.

479
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,610
An awful way to die.

480
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,846
Which way is that?

481
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,091
Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?

482
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,650
Some believe the King choked.

483
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:00,642
Some believe the sky is blue because we
live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant.

484
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,848
The King was poisoned.

485
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,011
I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.

486
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,401
I did. This is why I know.

487
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,370
Your hatred for my family
is rather well-known.

488
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,851
You arrive at the capital,
an expert in poisoning,

489
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,720
some days later
my grandson dies of poisoning.

490
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,205
Rather suspicious.

491
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,044
Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon?

492
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,806
You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel
on the day that you arrived.

493
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,163
- What did you discuss?
- You think we conspired together?

494
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,605
What did you discuss?

495
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,610
The death of my sister.

496
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,730
For which you blame me.

497
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,201
She was raped and murdered
by the Mountain.

498
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,726
The Mountain follows your orders.

499
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,290
Of course I blame you.

500
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,324
Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.

501
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,561
Should I be concerned?

502
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,087
You are unarmed and unguarded
because you know me better than that.

503
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,685
I am a man of reason.

504
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,408
If I cut your throat today,
I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow.

505
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,246
Men at war commit all kinds of crimes
without their superiors' knowledge.

506
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,800
So you deny involvement in Elia's murder?

507
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,604
Categorically.

508
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,041
I would like to speak with the Mountain.

509
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,601
I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.

510
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,604
He might not enjoy it
as much as he thinks he would.

511
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,530
I could arrange for this meeting.

512
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,402
But you want something in return.

513
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,090
There will be a trial for my son
and, as custom dictates,

514
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,970
three judges will render a verdict.

515
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,451
I will preside.

516
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,649
Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge.

517
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,849
I would like you to be the third.

518
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,765
Why?

519
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:54,640
Not long ago,
the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon.

520
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,405
Declared themselves enemies of the throne.

521
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,562
Now they are our strongest allies.

522
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,120
Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen.

523
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,449
Asking me to judge at your son's trial
isn't quite as tempting.

524
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,362
I would also invite you
to sit on the Small Council

525
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,922
to serve as one of
the new king's principal advisors.

526
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,448
I never realised
you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

527
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,206
We are not the Seven Kingdoms
until Dorne returns to the fold.

528
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,922
The King is dead.
The Greyjoys are in open rebellion.

529
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,045
A wildling army marches on the Wall.

530
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:38,409
And in the east,
a Targaryen girl has three dragons.

531
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,764
Before long,
she will turn her eyes to Westeros.

532
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:49,485
Only the Dornish managed to resist
Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.

533
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,203
You're saying you need us?

534
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,441
That must be hard for you to admit.

535
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,568
We need each other.

536
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,204
You help me serve justice to
the King's assassins,

537
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,045
and I will help you serve
justice to Elia's.

538
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,721
Podrick.

539
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,931
Apologies for the stench.

540
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,287
I brought you some wine, my lord,
but they took it from me.

541
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,890
A noble effort.

542
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,247
They didn't find the candles, though.

543
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,764
A quill, some parchment,

544
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,525
duck sausage, almonds,

545
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,642
and some hard cheese.

546
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,290
You're a good lad.

547
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,565
Any word of Shae?

548
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,251
I've heard nothing, my lord.

549
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,769
I suppose that's a good thing.

550
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,643
What are they saying about me out there?

551
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,770
You're to stand trial in a fortnight
for murdering the King.

552
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,770
- Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?
- No, my lord.

553
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,727
You didn't?

554
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,441
Gods, no.

555
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,765
The world is a better place without him,
but I had nothing to do with it.

556
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,566
I would like to think
if I were arranging a royal assassination,

557
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,688
I'd plan it in such a way that
I wouldn't be standing there,

558
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,569
gawking like a fool when the King died.

559
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,289
Trial in a fortnight.

560
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,287
Have they announced the judges yet?

561
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,685
- Your father.
- Of course.

562
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,842
Mace Tyrell.

563
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,730
Who will vote exactly
as my father tells him to vote.

564
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,889
- And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.
- Oberyn?

565
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,889
Give it to my father.

566
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,201
He never fails to take advantage
of a family tragedy.

567
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,921
I'm supposed to get a list
of names from you, my lord.

568
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,526
Anyone who might testify on your behalf.

569
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,250
Oh, I can call my own witnesses?

570
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,650
How generous of them.

571
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,529
Very well, my wife. Sansa.

572
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,489
My lord, she's gone.

573
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,690
- Gone?
- No one's seen her since the wedding.

574
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,411
You don't think she...

575
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,168
No one had more cause to kill Joffrey
than Sansa,

576
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,242
but the girl is no assassin.

577
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,449
Whoever killed the King
wanted me to lose my head for it.

578
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,002
And with my wife's disappearance,
it makes me seem that much more guilty.

579
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,928
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

580
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,490
- They'll be following you now.
- Who will?

581
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,291
I don't know. They. The ominous they.

582
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,364
The man pulling the strings.
Or woman. My father.

583
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,931
Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him.

584
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,731
Sweet Tommen will be
so much easier to handle.

585
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,042
Whenever something bad happens to me, I
assume it's my sister that had a hand in it.

586
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,482
But say what you will of Cersei,

587
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,210
she loves her children.

588
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:01,211
She is the only one I'm certain
had nothing to do with this murder.

589
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,969
Which makes it unique
as King's Landing murders go.

590
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,088
Any other witnesses, my lord?

591
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,803
Varys could vouch for me, if he dared.

592
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,882
He's already been called
as a witness for the Queen.

593
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,884
Of course. Fetch Bronn.
I have a job for him.

594
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,644
I've already asked, my lord.
They won't let him see you.

595
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,767
Why not?

596
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,411
They say he's a known cutthroat
and your close associate.

597
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,005
He's under investigation himself.

598
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,323
And my brother?
Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?

599
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,481
I'll ask, my lord.

600
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,326
There's something else, my lord.

601
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,683
A man, I didn't know his face,

602
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,603
he came to ask if I'd testify against you.

603
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,171
Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne

604
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,602
if I told the judges
you'd bought a poison called the strangler.

605
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,968
Ser Podrick Payne?

606
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:04,125
- Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?
- I didn't tell them anything, my lord.

607
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,524
Are you going to accept their offer?

608
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,530
- My lord.
- Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion.

609
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,888
If they can't tempt you with honey,
they'll choose something less sweet.

610
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,760
- You've been good to me, my lord.
- Pod, the trial's in a fortnight.

611
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,444
They'll want an answer before that.

612
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,806
I already gave them an answer, my lord.

613
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,890
I will not have you dying on my behalf.

614
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,200
Do you hear me?

615
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,965
If I have to take that long walk to
the executioner's block,

616
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,486
I don't want to see
your head already mounted.

617
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,245
- My lord.
- Pod, I am giving you an order.

618
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,767
Go and find my brother.
Tell him I need him.

619
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,085
And get yourself out of King's Landing
before it's too late.

620
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,004
Pod!

621
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,725
This is farewell.

622
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,807
Farewell, my lord.

623
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,846
Pod.

624
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,163
There has never lived a more loyal squire.

625
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,485
Mother says it's time to eat.

626
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,201
What's she got boiling? Wait. Let me guess.

627
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,441
Potatoes.

628
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,808
No one boils a potato better than your mom.

629
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,325
She got...

630
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,687
The wildlings!

631
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,571
Guymon!

632
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,805
Hide.

633
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,848
- Hide!
- Run!

634
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,687
- You know how to get to Castle Black?
- Yes.

635
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,681
Those your parents?

636
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,724
Open your eyes.

637
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,604
I'm going to eat them.

638
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,685
Do you hear me?

639
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,366
I'm going to eat your dead mama

640
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,205
and your dead papa.

641
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,130
Go tell the crows at Castle Black.

642
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,970
We need to teach them a lesson
about the way we deal with their kind.

643
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,121
Aye! Aye!

644
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,205
Three dozen bodies with slit
throats tossed off the top of the Wall.

645
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,362
- Seems like that would be a good lesson.
- Aye!

646
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,011
If we go after them,
we'll be giving them what they want.

647
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,406
They want to draw us out,
pick us off a few at a time.

648
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,245
We have just over 100 men.

649
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,563
And that's including stewards and builders.

650
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,608
And me. We can't afford
to lose a single man.

651
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,961
We must remember our first responsibility.

652
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,131
We are the watchers on the Wall.

653
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,886
There's got to be a way to protect them.

654
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,285
You're a champion of the common people,
Lord Snow.

655
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,170
What do you say
to Brother Pyp's proposition?

656
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,847
Mance Rayder is coming.

657
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,761
If the wildlings breach the Wall,

658
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,611
they'll roll over everything
and everyone for 1,000 miles

659
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,489
before they reach an
army that can stop them.

660
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,162
We need to shore up Castle Black

661
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,601
and defend the Wall.

662
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,882
That is our job.

663
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,845
Rangers returning.

664
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,489
Help him.

665
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,010
Thought you'd have blue eyes by now.

666
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,051
What took you so long?

667
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,607
- We were held up.
- By what?

668
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,121
Chains.

669
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,807
We were guests of the mutineers
at Craster's Keep.

670
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,531
- And the mutineers stayed?
- They're not going anywhere.

671
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,723
They've got Craster's food and his wives.

672
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,361
Poor girls.
Never thought they'd miss their daddy.

673
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,084
Karl's running things now.

674
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,640
He's the one who put a knife
through Craster's mouth.

675
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,324
We need to ride north and kill them all.

676
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,970
We just went over this, boy.

677
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,520
- Justice can wait.
- It's not about justice.

678
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:36,128
I told the wildlings we had over
1,000 men at Castle Black alone.

679
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,527
Karl and the others know the truth
as well as we do.

680
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,487
How long do you think they'll keep
that information to themselves

681
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,564
when the wildlings are
peeling their fingernails off?

682
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,683
Mance has all he needs to crush us,
he just doesn't know it yet.

683
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,326
As soon as he gets his hands on them,
he will.

684
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,769
Then he'll throw his full strength at us.

685
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,210
And even if every one of us
kills 100 wildlings,

686
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,886
there's still not a thing
we can do to stop them.

687
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,481
I don't think I can kill 100 wildlings.

688
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,608
Are they attacking?

689
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,208
A single rider.

690
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,651
A champion of Meereen.

691
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,724
They want you to send your own champion
against him.

692
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,489
What is he doing?

693
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,291
I believe he means to...

694
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,882
He says that
we're an army of men without man parts.

695
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,601
He claims you are no woman at all,
but a man who

696
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,048
hides his cock in his own arsehole.

697
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,086
Ignore him, Your Grace.
These are meaningless words.

698
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,449
They're not meaningless if half the city
you intend to take is listening to them.

699
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,650
I have something to say
to the people of Meereen.

700
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,684
First, I will need this one to be quiet.

701
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,841
Do I have a champion?

702
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,364
Allow me this honour, Mother of Dragons.

703
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,802
I will not disappoint you.

704
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,765
You are the commander of the Unsullied.

705
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,805
I cannot risk you.

706
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,648
Your Grace, I've won more single combats
than any man alive.

707
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,927
Which is why you must remain by my side.

708
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:48,928
I've been by your side
longer than any of them, Khaleesi.

709
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,604
Let me stand for you today as well.

710
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,569
You are my most trusted advisor,

711
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,530
my most valued general,
and my dearest friend.

712
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,329
I will not gamble with your life.

713
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,921
I was the last to join your army.

714
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,207
I'm not your general
or a member of your Queensguard

715
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,566
or the commander of your Unsullied.

716
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,009
My mother was a whore. I come from nothing.

717
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,003
I will return to nothing.

718
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,847
Let me kill this man for you.

719
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,365
Very well.

720
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,851
You have quite an audience.

721
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,320
Make it worth their while.

722
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,050
He is very brave, Your Grace.

723
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,451
Yes, win or lose,

724
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,609
as long as the whole city is watching.

725
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,330
You sure you don't want a horse?

726
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,051
Why would I want a horse?

727
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,648
Horses are faster than men.

728
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,442
Horses are dumber than men.

729
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,286
I am Daenerys Stormborn.

730
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:17,246
Your Masters may have
told you lies about me,

731
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,368
or they may have told you nothing.

732
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,965
It does not matter.

733
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,968
I have nothing to say to them.

734
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,523
I speak only to you.

735
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,724
First, I went to Astapor.

736
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,968
Those who were slaves in Astapor,

737
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,607
now stand behind me,

738
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:37,960
free.

739
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,608
Next I went to Yunkai.

740
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,728
Those who were slaves in Yunkai,

741
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,807
now stand behind me,

742
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,841
free.

743
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,482
Now I have come to Meereen.

744
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,288
I am not your enemy.

745
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,887
Your enemy is beside you.

746
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:07,322
Your enemy steals and
murders your children.

747
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,644
Your enemy has nothing for you
but chains and suffering

748
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,889
and commands.

749
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,843
I did not bring you commands.

750
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,649
I bring you a choice.

751
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:26,003
And I bring your enemies what they deserve.

752
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,650
Forward!

753
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,361
Fire!
1
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,049
"My name

2
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,168
"is Grey Worm.

3
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,207
"I come from

4
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,886
"the Summer Ills."

5
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,845
"Isles."

6
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,761
"Summer Isles."

7
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,921
"Summer Isles."

8
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,367
I am from an island called Naath.

9
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,324
When they took you?

10
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,167
When did they take me?

11
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,527
I was five years old.

12
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,604
You remember your home?

13
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,084
I remember
when they rowed us away from shore.

14
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,361
How white the beaches were.

15
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,447
How tall the trees.

16
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,485
And I remember my village burning.

17
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,847
Smoke rising into the sky.

18
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,326
Do you remember your home?

19
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,363
Unsullied.

20
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,807
Always Unsullied.

21
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,089
Before Unsullied, nothing.

22
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,969
That's not true.

23
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,811
Perhaps one day
you will return to the Summer Isles.

24
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,769
I don't want return.

25
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,651
"Kill the masters."

26
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,764
Kill the masters.

27
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,770
How are the lessons coming?

28
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,969
Very well, Your Grace.

29
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,051
Missandei is teacher good, my queen.

30
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,804
You'll have to continue later.

31
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,171
It's time.

32
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,281
You heard her!

33
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,167
She said she came to free us!

34
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,405
You're a fool.

35
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,845
The Masters are too strong.

36
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,524
She will protect us.

37
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,323
She defeated the Masters' champion.

38
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,689
She has a great army.

39
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,404
You want to live the rest of your days
in chains?

40
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,726
I want to live.

41
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,768
You saw what they did to those children.

42
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,243
What do you think they'll do to us?

43
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,245
I've been through two slave revolts, boy.

44
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,970
They always end the same way:

45
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,928
the Masters in power and the slaves dead.

46
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,884
All men must die.

47
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,763
But I promise you,

48
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,004
a single day of freedom is worth
more than a lifetime in chains.

49
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,806
Who are you?

50
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,440
This one is called Grey Worm.

51
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,931
I was taken as a baby
by the Masters of Astapor,

52
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,681
raised and trained as Unsullied.

53
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,200
Now I fight for Daenerys,

54
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,487
the Mother of Dragons

55
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,481
and Breaker of Chains.

56
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,605
You are Unsullied?

57
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,323
They taught you how to fight
before you could walk.

58
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,330
We are not soldiers!

59
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,686
We have no training,

60
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,041
no weapons.

61
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,766
There are three slaves in
this city for every Master.

62
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,006
No one can give you your freedom, brothers.

63
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,891
If you want it,

64
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,928
you must take it.

65
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,169
Mhysa!

66
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,887
Mhysa!

67
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,444
Remind me, Ser Jorah,

68
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,206
how many children
did the Great Masters nail to mileposts?

69
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,362
163, Khaleesi.

70
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,330
That was it.

71
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,327
Your Grace, may I have a word?

72
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,491
The city is yours.

73
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,967
All these people, they're
your subjects now.

74
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,725
Sometimes it is better to
answer injustice with mercy.

75
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,802
I will answer injustice with justice.

76
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,803
What the hell was that?

77
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,363
That was me knocking your arse
to the dirt with your own hand.

78
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,886
You're a rare talent.

79
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,801
When you're fighting cripples, anyway.

80
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,408
You learned to fight
like a good little boy.

81
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,768
I'll bet that thrust through the Mad
King's back was pretty as a picture.

82
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,128
You want to fight pretty
or you want to win?

83
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,850
You talk to my brother this way?

84
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,490
All the time.

85
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,684
He got used to it.

86
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,601
Do you think he did it?

87
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,767
No.

88
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,202
Oh, he hated the little twat, sure.

89
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,281
But who didn't?

90
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,682
And poison's not his style.

91
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,608
Or murder.

92
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,443
You want to know for sure,
why don't you ask him?

93
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,011
You haven't been to see him yet, eh?

94
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,209
We're done for today.

95
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,488
Your brother ever tell you
how I came into his service?

96
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,362
You stood for him in
his trial by combat at the Eyrie.

97
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,885
Aye.

98
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,204
But only when Lady Arryn
demanded the trial take place that day.

99
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,650
You were his first choice.

100
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,085
He named you for his champion

101
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,562
because he knew you would ride
day and night to come fight for him.

102
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,960
You gonna fight for him now?

103
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,960
To tell you the
truth, this isn't so bad.

104
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,203
Four walls. A pot to piss in.

105
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,490
I was chained to a wooden post
covered in my own shit for months.

106
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,006
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

107
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,525
Maybe a bit.

108
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,361
I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.

109
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,003
It's complicated.

110
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,887
So how is our sister?

111
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,087
How do you think?

112
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,562
Her son died in her arms.

113
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,887
Her son?

114
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,041
Don't.

115
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,570
- You know what's coming?
- Hmm.

116
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,400
My trial for regicide.

117
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,522
I know
the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty,

118
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,682
that one of my three judges

119
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,207
has wished me dead
more times than I can count.

120
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,448
And that judge is my father.

121
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,491
As for Cersei,

122
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,688
well, she's probably working on a way

123
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,962
to avoid a trial altogether
by having me killed.

124
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,246
She did ask.

125
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,331
So, should I turn around and close my eyes?

126
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,920
Depends.

127
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,881
Did you do it?

128
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,567
The Kingslayer brothers. You like it?

129
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,805
I like it.

130
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,407
You're really asking if I killed your son?

131
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,885
Are you really asking
if I'd kill my brother?

132
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,286
How can I help you?

133
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,806
You could set me free.

134
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,924
You know I can't.

135
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,208
Then there's really nothing else to say.

136
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,681
What do you want me to do? Kill the guards?

137
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,603
Sneak you out of the city
in the back of a cart?

138
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,205
I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.

139
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,885
Sorry, I'd forgotten.

140
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,048
I'd hate for you to do
something inappropriate.

141
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,451
Inappropriate?

142
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,524
You're accused of killing the King.
Freeing you is treason.

143
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,523
Except I didn't do it.

144
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,364
Which is why we're having a trial.

145
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,441
Oh!

146
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,045
A trial.

147
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,851
If the killer threw himself
before the Iron Throne,

148
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,050
confessed to his crimes,
and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt,

149
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,531
it wouldn't matter to Cersei.

150
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,490
She won't rest until my head's on a spike.

151
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,806
Not just yours.

152
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,970
She's offering a knighthood to
whomever finds Sansa Stark.

153
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,731
Sansa couldn't have done this.

154
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,326
She had more reason than
anyone in the Seven Kingdoms.

155
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,686
Do you think it's a coincidence

156
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,165
she disappeared the same
night Joffrey died?

157
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,641
No, but

158
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,129
Sansa's not a killer.

159
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,326
Not yet, anyway.

160
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,088
Where are you taking me?

161
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,129
I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa.

162
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,410
She's waiting for us at the Eyrie.

163
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,284
You'll be safe there.

164
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,851
Did you kill Joffrey?

165
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,724
Did I kill Joffrey?

166
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,364
I've been in the Vale for weeks.

167
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,687
I know it was you.

168
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,371
And who helped me with this conspiracy?

169
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,484
There was Ser Dontos.

170
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,608
You used him to get me
out of King's Landing,

171
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,331
but you would never trust
him to kill the King.

172
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,881
Why not?

173
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,610
Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.

174
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,404
Then perhaps it was your husband.

175
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,610
No.

176
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,967
How do you know?

177
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,565
I just do.

178
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,928
You're right.
He wasn't involved in Joffrey's death.

179
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,161
But you were.

180
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,962
Do you remember
that lovely necklace Dontos gave you?

181
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,604
I don't suppose you noticed
that a stone was missing after the feast.

182
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,921
The poison.

183
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,966
I don't understand.

184
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,520
The Lannisters gave you wealth, power.

185
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,404
Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal.

186
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,731
A man with no motive
is a man no one suspects.

187
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,243
Always keep your foes confused.

188
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,007
If they don't know who
you are or what you want,

189
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,128
they can't know what you plan to do next.

190
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,484
I don't believe you.

191
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,683
If they catch you, they'll put your head

192
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,723
on a spike just like my father's.

193
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,924
You'd risk that just to confuse them?

194
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,011
So many men, they risk so little.

195
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,206
They spend their lives avoiding danger.

196
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,485
And then they die.

197
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,448
I'd risk everything to get what I want.

198
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,725
And what do you want?

199
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,201
Everything.

200
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,768
My friendship
with the Lannisters was productive.

201
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,201
But Joffrey,

202
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:45,009
a vicious boy with a crown on his head,
is not a reliable ally.

203
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,249
And who could trust a friend like that?

204
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,524
Who could trust you?

205
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,288
I don't want friends like me.

206
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,647
My new friends are predictable.

207
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,245
Very reasonable people.

208
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,482
As for what happened to Joffrey,

209
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,327
that was something
my new friends wanted very badly.

210
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,882
Nothing like a thoughtful gift

211
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,162
to make a new friendship grow strong.

212
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,683
I can't believe you're going.

213
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,445
Leaving me alone here with these people.

214
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,568
The time has come, my dear.

215
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,484
There's nothing more tedious than a trial.

216
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,887
Except perhaps these gardens.

217
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,562
If I have to take one more leisurely stroll
through these gardens,

218
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,086
I'll fling myself from the cliffs.

219
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,124
Have you been to see Tommen yet?

220
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,247
No.

221
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,282
Have they even agreed to the match?
No one tells me anything.

222
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,285
I wasn't originally meant to
marry your grandfather Luthor.

223
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,524
He was engaged to my sister,
your great-aunt Viola.

224
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,364
I was to be given to
some Targaryen or other.

225
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,246
Marrying a Targaryen
was all the rage back then.

226
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,045
But the moment I saw my intended,

227
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,965
with his twitchy little ferret's face

228
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,249
and ludicrous silver hair,
I knew he wouldn't do.

229
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,604
So the evening
before Luthor was to propose to my sister,

230
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,490
I got lost on my way back
from my embroidery lesson

231
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,927
and happened upon his chamber.

232
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,606
How absentminded of me.

233
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,205
Mmm-hmm.

234
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,682
The following morning,
Luthor never made it down the stairs

235
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,128
to propose to my sister
'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk.

236
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,762
And once he could, the only thing he wanted

237
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,082
was what I'd given him the night before.

238
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,201
I was good.

239
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,728
I was very good.

240
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,321
You are even better.

241
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,251
But you need to act quickly.

242
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,242
Cersei may be vicious,
but she's not stupid.

243
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,369
She'll turn the boy against you
as soon as she can.

244
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,523
And by the time you're married,
it'll be too late.

245
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,125
Luckily for you, the Queen Regent

246
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,685
is rather distracted at the moment.

247
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,650
Mourning her dear departed boy.

248
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,806
Accusing her brother of his murder,
which he didn't commit.

249
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,361
He could have done.

250
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,204
But he didn't.

251
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,725
You don't know, Grandmother.

252
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,251
But I do know.

253
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,644
You don't think
I'd let you marry that beast, do you?

254
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,764
What? I don't understand.

255
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,484
Shh.

256
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,925
Don't you worry yourself about all that.

257
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,366
You just do what needs to be done.

258
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,650
Bring it through!

259
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,331
And again.

260
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,284
Very nice. Good.

261
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,331
A lot of wildlings fight
with a weapon in each hand.

262
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,170
First thing you want to do

263
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,325
is disarm them to try and even the odds.

264
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,367
Let's see what you can do.

265
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,205
Olly, you just watch for now.

266
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,481
I can fight.

267
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,524
Have you ever held a sword before?

268
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,087
I was the best archer in our hamlet.

269
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,202
I was!

270
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,324
I believe you.

271
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,970
We'll go hunting for rabbits one day.

272
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,520
Right now, watch and learn.

273
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,526
You two.

274
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,125
Take it slow, try and disarm each other.

275
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,601
You know how to fight.

276
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,250
You could have gone easier on him.

277
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,565
He wouldn't have learned anything that way.

278
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,244
Lord Snow.

279
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,521
What do you think you're doing?

280
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,930
Grenn and I were helping them.

281
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,764
Grenn's a ranger. You're a steward.

282
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,210
Maybe you forgot that while you
were off with your wildling bitch,

283
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,327
but I didn't.

284
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,440
Someone has to train them.

285
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,444
And that someone isn't you.

286
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,603
Go find a chamber pot to empty.

287
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,445
Go on. Do it.

288
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,448
You traitor's bastard.

289
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,204
Give me an excuse.

290
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,965
Mormont's not here to protect you now.

291
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,090
Get back to work.

292
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,761
Now!

293
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,045
I said now!

294
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,490
The bastard's well-liked. You're not.

295
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,406
You think I care if they like me?
We're at war.

296
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,164
For now.

297
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,607
But you can't be acting commander forever.

298
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,569
There will be a choosing.

299
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,244
The old maester will insist on it.

300
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,807
You might reconsider his request
to march on Craster's.

301
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,929
Let the mutineers take care of Snow.

302
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,004
Or you might be taking orders from him
the rest of your life.

303
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,127
A bastard, eh?

304
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,249
Took you for highborn.

305
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,050
My father was highborn.

306
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,766
My mother wasn't.

307
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,130
Name's Locke.

308
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,246
Jon Snow.

309
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,846
You fight well.

310
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,724
What brought you up here?

311
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,370
A sense of duty.

312
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,122
I wanted to do my part
for the safety of the realm.

313
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,520
I was a game warden in the Stormlands.

314
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,001
Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids.

315
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,889
I was stupid enough to get caught.

316
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,042
Chose the Wall over losing my hand.

317
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,603
Figured I wouldn't have to
suck up to any highborn cunts here.

318
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,444
Come on, get on with it.

319
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,921
What are you waiting for? Summer?

320
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,081
Guess I was wrong.

321
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,842
You sent for me, Your Grace?

322
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,048
Your Grace.

323
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,804
How formal of you.

324
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,490
How many Kingsguards
are posted outside Tommen's door?

325
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,845
Ser Boros is on duty tonight.
Tomorrow I believe...

326
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,126
So one?

327
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,411
You have one man guarding the future king?

328
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,687
I promise you Tommen's safe.

329
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,841
We're protecting him.

330
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,121
The way you protected Joffrey?

331
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,881
Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?

332
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,200
What?

333
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,560
I've been wondering for months.

334
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,801
Ever since that great cow
brought you back to the capital.

335
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,006
Why did she set you free?

336
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,890
You know why. She'd hoped
I'd send her daughters back to her.

337
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,084
She hoped or did you promise?

338
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,810
I swore by all the gods

339
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,042
that if her daughters were alive,
I'd return them to her.

340
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,203
So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.

341
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,408
I wanted to get back to you.

342
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,771
Should I have told her to fuck off?

343
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,971
You didn't mean it, then?

344
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,890
You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?

345
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,684
Catelyn Stark's dead.

346
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,161
So if I told you to leave the
capital right now and find Sansa,

347
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,322
if I told you to find that
murderous little bitch

348
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,323
and bring me her head,

349
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,366
would you do it?

350
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,169
I know you went to see Tyrion.

351
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,486
That creature who murdered our son.

352
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,002
I had to see him.

353
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,525
I had to know for myself.

354
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,401
And?

355
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,766
He didn't do it, Cersei.

356
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,286
You've always pitied him.

357
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,530
Our poor little brother.

358
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,521
Abused by the world,
despised by his father and sister.

359
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,567
He'd kill us all if he could.

360
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,762
I want four men at Tommen's door
day and night.

361
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,007
That will be all, Lord Commander.

362
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,402
Ser Pounce?

363
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,568
How did you
get past the Kingsguard?

364
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,449
Kingsguard.

365
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,764
I don't think you're supposed to be here.

366
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,091
Mother doesn't allow me
to have visitors at night.

367
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,288
I'm not a visitor, Your Grace.

368
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,444
Word has it I'm to be your bride.

369
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,366
Did you know that people
in arranged marriages

370
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,284
often never meet until their wedding day?

371
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,568
Before we decide to spend
our lives together,

372
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,927
we ought to get to know one another.

373
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,525
Don't you think?

374
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,126
Yes.

375
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,601
But if my mother found out...

376
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,801
It can be our secret.

377
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,201
Hmm?

378
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,482
If we're going to be man and wife,

379
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,167
we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope.

380
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,925
So, Your Grace...

381
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,650
Yes?

382
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,048
Tell me a secret.

383
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,606
Hello. Aren't you a proper fellow?

384
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,728
That's Ser Pounce.

385
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,045
Very handsome.

386
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,725
Joffrey didn't like him.

387
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,244
He threatened to skin him alive

388
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,124
and mix his innards up in my food

389
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,844
so I wouldn't know I was eating him.

390
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,684
That's very cruel.

391
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,443
You don't strike me as cruel.

392
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,089
No.

393
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,727
I don't think I am.

394
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,768
That's a relief.

395
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,048
Because you know
what happens when we marry?

396
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,488
We say our vows in front
of the High Septon.

397
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,729
And after the ceremony, there's a feast.

398
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,723
When we marry, I become yours.

399
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,086
Forever.

400
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,850
It's getting late.

401
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,130
I should go.

402
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,725
May I come and visit you again?

403
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,284
All right, then.

404
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,371
Remember,

405
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,562
our little secret.

406
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,764
"Ser Jaime Lannister.

407
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,250
"Knighted and named to the Kingsguard
in his 16th year.

408
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,450
"At the sack of King's Landing,
murdered his king, Aerys II.

409
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,124
"Pardoned by Robert Baratheon.

410
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,049
"Thereafter known as the Kingslayer."

411
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,489
It's the duty of the Lord Commander
to fill those pages.

412
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,286
And there's still room left on mine.

413
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,646
Valyrian steel.

414
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,847
Mmm.

415
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,841
It's yours.

416
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,851
I can't accept this.

417
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,331
It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword.

418
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,691
You'll use it to defend
Ned Stark's daughter.

419
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,811
You swore an oath

420
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,131
to return the Stark girls to their mother.

421
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,089
Lady Stark's dead.

422
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,525
Arya's probably dead, too,

423
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,843
but there's still a chance to
find Sansa and get her somewhere safe.

424
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,851
I've got something else for you.

425
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,121
I hope I got your measurements right.

426
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,280
I'll find her.

427
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,403
For Lady Catelyn.

428
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,801
And for you.

429
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,088
I almost forgot.

430
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,402
I have one more gift.

431
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,322
I don't need a squire.

432
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,845
Of course you do.

433
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,200
He'll slow me down.

434
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,526
My brother owes him a debt.

435
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,406
He's not safe here. You'll be keeping
him from harm. It's chivalry.

436
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,245
I won't slow you down, ser.

437
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,921
My lady.

438
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,284
I promise I'll serve you well.

439
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,603
See? He's a good lad. You'll get along.

440
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,209
Compliments of Lord Tyrion.

441
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,123
His axe from the Blackwater.

442
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,330
What are you waiting for, a kiss?

443
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,607
Ready the lady's horse.

444
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,442
They say the best swords have names.
Any ideas?

445
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,331
Oathkeeper.

446
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,645
Goodbye, Brienne.

447
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,682
Come on, move.

448
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,720
I should never have taken her away.

449
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,450
She wasn't safe here.

450
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,244
She's not safe out there.

451
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,567
I should have known.

452
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,563
You told us
there were wildlings south of the Wall.

453
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,484
If they're raiding the smaller villages,
Mole's Town could be next.

454
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,210
Castle Black could be next.

455
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,725
I should go back for Gilly.

456
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,325
We have orders. No one's
to leave the castle.

457
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,971
I remember when you disobeyed orders
and rode south to help Robb.

458
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,202
And I remember
who came after me and brought me home.

459
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,250
I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me.

460
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,645
When you told me about
Bran going beyond the Wall,

461
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,484
all I could think about was
getting my strength back

462
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,925
so I could go and find him.

463
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,800
I wish I could have convinced him
to come back with me.

464
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,080
I tried. Really, I did.

465
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,728
How fast could they travel?

466
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,483
A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge
by a simpleton?

467
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,005
I don't know.

468
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,845
They'd pass wildling villages.

469
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,810
They could try and find
shelter at one of them.

470
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,611
The wildlings have joined up with Mance.

471
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,929
Every village or sheltered place
will be deserted.

472
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,283
Except...

473
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,967
Craster's?

474
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,963
- You think Bran might have found...
- Snow.

475
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,883
I don't mean to interrupt.

476
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,531
Thorne wants to see you.

477
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,851
Your foray to Craster's Keep,

478
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,286
I'll sanction it.

479
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,201
But I won't order anyone to go with you.

480
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,807
Volunteers only.

481
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,281
Thank you, Ser Alliser.

482
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,928
Brothers.

483
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,807
I'm going beyond the Wall to Craster's Keep

484
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,970
to capture the mutineers holed up there

485
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,764
or kill them.

486
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,923
I'm asking for volunteers to come with me.

487
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,803
There's 60 miles of wilderness
between here and Craster's,

488
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,168
and Mance Rayder has an army
bearing down on us,

489
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,611
but we have to do this.

490
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,966
Our survival may depend on us getting to

491
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,566
these mutineers before Mance does.

492
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,770
They know the Wall. They know our defences.

493
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,810
If Mance learns what they know, we're lost.

494
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,441
But if that's not enough,

495
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,851
then consider this.

496
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,530
If the Night's Watch are truly brothers,

497
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,927
then Lord Commander Mormont
was our father.

498
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,761
He lived and died for the Watch

499
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,968
and he was betrayed by his own men.

500
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,690
Stabbed in the back by cowards.

501
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,644
He deserved far better.

502
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,361
All we can give him now is justice.

503
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,364
Who will join me?

504
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,681
I can't let a recruit
come north of the Wall.

505
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,240
Then let me say my vows.

506
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,243
If it's a fight you're heading for,

507
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,283
then you need men who know how.

508
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,600
Thank you, brothers.

509
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,802
No, don't.

510
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,971
Don't, please.

511
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,400
Please don't.

512
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,324
Ow! You're hurting me.

513
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,564
Karl Tanner from Gin Alley

514
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:13,091
drinking wine from the skull
of Jeor fucking Mormont.

515
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:23,045
Any command for us, Lord Commander?

516
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,164
What's that?

517
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,008
Fuck 'em till they're dead?

518
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,722
Did you hear that, boys?

519
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,370
Fuck 'em till they're dead.

520
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,121
Rast.

521
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,002
Go outside and feed the beast.

522
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,202
We should kill that thing.

523
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,929
You should shut your fucking hole,

524
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,162
ugly little cunt.

525
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,283
You look like a fucking ballsack. Ugly.

526
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,886
Look at your stupid cunt face.

527
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,760
I could piss in any gutter
and soak five of you.

528
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,647
Know how much they paid me to
kill a man in King's Landing?

529
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,250
Seven silvers.

530
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,166
They told me a man's name
and that man never saw daylight again.

531
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,130
None of them cocksuckers got away from me.

532
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,651
Haven't lost a fight since I was nine.

533
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,163
Maybe it's time.

534
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,161
What do you think? Eh?

535
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,042
Maybe you're the man.

536
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,282
Eh, cunt?

537
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,241
I wouldn't stand a chance.

538
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,241
None of us would.

539
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,284
I was a fucking legend in Gin Alley.

540
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,686
A fucking legend!

541
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,481
I would take any knight, any time.

542
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,363
You fucking cunts in steel plate.
Fucking cowards.

543
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:16,448
A gift for the gods.

544
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,125
A gift for the gods.

545
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,651
What the fuck is that?

546
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,884
Craster's last child. A boy.

547
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,564
What am I supposed to do with him?

548
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,484
What did Craster do?

549
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,444
Kill 'em before they could grow up
and do the same to him?

550
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,486
All right.

551
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,809
Don't need another mouth to feed.

552
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,649
Hand him over.

553
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,444
He didn't kill them.

554
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,567
He offered them.

555
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,681
To who?

556
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,807
To the gods.

557
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,085
The White Walkers.

558
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,401
A gift for the gods.

559
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:56,566
A gift for the gods.

560
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,321
Shut up!

561
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,883
So,

562
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,201
if it worked for him...

563
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,004
...let's give the Walkers what they want.

564
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,688
Rast is headed that way.

565
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,768
Pink-eyed fuck.

566
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,084
You thirsty?

567
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,246
Fuck!

568
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,410
Hodor.

569
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:04,847
Do you hear that?

570
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,211
Is that a baby?

571
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,729
It's coming.

572
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,407
I'm going out there.

573
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,651
No, we need to stay together.

574
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,529
I'm going.

575
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,930
Bran.

576
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,650
Hodor.

577
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,444
- Bran, what happened?
- It's Summer. He's hurt.

578
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,931
They've caught him in a trap.

579
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,445
Who?

580
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,921
I didn't see, but they
have my brother's wolf.

581
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,844
They have Ghost.

582
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,851
They're Night's Watch.

583
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,771
Look.

584
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,409
Jon might be here.

585
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,848
If Jon was here,
why would they put his wolf in a cage?

586
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:42,044
They might have been Night's Watch once,
not any more.

587
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,451
We're not safe here. We need to go.

588
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,965
No.

589
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,287
Bran, we need to go now.

590
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,965
I'm not leaving without Summer.

591
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,691
Can you remember where the cage was?

592
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,049
The east side of the keep.

593
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,691
If I'm not back soon, we'll meet...

594
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,370
Hodor.

595
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,201
Hodor.

596
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,851
Hodor.

597
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,446
Hodor.

598
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,089
If I was your size,
I'd be king of the fucking world.

599
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,490
Help him up.

600
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,204
This is nice.

601
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,604
Fine leather.

602
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,162
You're no wildling.

603
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,960
Important. Highborn.

604
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,045
Who are you?

605
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,249
You see, where I come from,

606
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:43,324
a commoner like me
slaps a little lord like you,

607
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,801
I'd lose me right hand.

608
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,481
But we're a long way from home, aren't we?

609
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,764
And then the two of you,

610
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:58,563
fancy-looking folks north of the Wall
creeping through the woods.

611
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,241
Isn't that a bit odd?

612
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,688
I like your curly hair.

613
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,325
My mom had curls like that.

614
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:16,130
Beautiful brown curls.

615
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,364
Why'd you drag a crippled boy
all the way up here?

616
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,281
Hmm?

617
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:28,802
See, you haven't played this game before.

618
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,722
A highborn hostage,

619
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,602
that's valuable.

620
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,049
But three of them,

621
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,805
that's a lot of mouths to feed.

622
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,484
What the fuck's wrong with him?

623
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,965
Come here.

624
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,531
No, please.

625
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,007
Please, let me help him.

626
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,207
Who are you?

627
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,527
Please.

628
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,687
Who are you?

629
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:55,044
I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.

630
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,651
It's Jon Snow's brother.

631
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,121
It's Meera. I'm right here.

632
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:08,762
And I thought
this was gonna be another boring day.

633
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,490
I'm right here.


1
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,691
May the Warrior grant him courage

2
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,730
and protect him in these perilous times.

3
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,928
May the Smith grant him strength

4
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,321
that he might bear this heavy burden.

5
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,129
And may the Crone,

6
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,931
she that knows the fate of all men,

7
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,207
show him the path he must walk

8
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,166
and guide him through the dark places
that lie ahead.

9
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,486
In the light of the Seven,

10
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,643
I now proclaim Tommen
of the House Baratheon,

11
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,290
First of His Name,

12
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,647
King of the Andals and the First Men

13
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,405
and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

14
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,484
Long may he reign!

15
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,403
Long may he reign!

16
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,768
Special day.

17
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,924
Your Grace.

18
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,689
Your Grace.

19
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,882
Your Grace.

20
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,164
Your Grace.

21
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,090
There he is.

22
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,329
Long may he reign.

23
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,125
He sits the throne like he was born to it.

24
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,443
Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?

25
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,926
No, he wasn't.

26
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,287
You still mourn for Joffrey?

27
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,283
He was my husband. My king.

28
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,441
He would have been your nightmare.

29
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,567
Your Grace, I feel...

30
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,563
You knew exactly what he was.

31
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,686
I did, too.

32
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,411
You never love anything in the world
the way you love your first child.

33
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,522
Doesn't matter what they do.

34
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,885
And what he did, it shocked me.

35
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,528
Do you think I'm easily shocked?

36
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,806
No.

37
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,248
The things he did shocked me.

38
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,763
He's only a boy.

39
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,084
A good, decent boy. He always has been.

40
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,489
Who was the last decent king, I wonder?

41
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,009
He could be the first man who sits on that
throne in 50 years to actually deserve it.

42
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,809
It would be some consolation, wouldn't it?

43
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,121
For all the horror that put him there.

44
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,921
He will need help

45
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,923
if he's going to rule well.

46
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,002
He has you.

47
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,366
A mother is not enough.

48
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,125
You're still interested in being queen?

49
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,924
After all that's happened?

50
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,283
It sounds strange, but I am...

51
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,450
I haven't even given any thought to it,
what comes next.

52
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,444
It would be a great honour, of course.

53
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,123
But I will have to speak
to my father about it.

54
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,131
Yes, speak to your father.

55
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,248
I'll speak to mine.

56
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,129
We may be faced with an alarming number
of weddings soon.

57
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,800
I won't even know what to call you.

58
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,645
Sister?

59
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,728
Or Mother?

60
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,722
King Joffrey Baratheon is dead.

61
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,484
Murdered at his own wedding.

62
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,810
And we've taken
the Meereenese navy, Your Grace.

63
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,928
The Second Sons took the navy.

64
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,968
Who told you to?

65
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,126
No one.

66
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,605
So why did you do it?

67
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,769
I heard you liked ships.

68
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,370
How many ships?

69
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,771
93, Your Grace.

70
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,330
How many men can they carry?

71
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,880
9,300, not counting sailors.

72
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,803
Would that be enough
to take King's Landing?

73
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,050
The Lannisters have more.

74
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,282
They've been fighting
Joffrey's wars for years.

75
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,204
They're tired, dispersed.

76
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,362
And now their king is dead.

77
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,410
8,000 Unsullied, 2,000 Second Sons

78
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,842
sailing into Blackwater Bay

79
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,491
and storming the gates without warning.

80
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,127
It's hard to say. It could be enough.

81
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,523
But we're not fighting to make you
queen of King's Landing.

82
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,604
10,000 men can't conquer Westeros.

83
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,364
The old houses
will flock to our queen

84
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,930
when she crosses the Narrow Sea.

85
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,685
The old houses will flock to
whichever side they think will win,

86
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,762
as they always have.

87
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,362
There's other news.

88
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,283
From Yunkai.

89
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,284
Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule,

90
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,727
the Wise Masters have
retaken control of the city.

91
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,291
They've reenslaved the freedmen
who stayed behind

92
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,761
and sworn to take revenge against you.

93
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,008
And in Astapor,

94
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,680
the council you installed
to rule over the city

95
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,843
has been overthrown
by a butcher named Cleon

96
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,083
who's declared himself
"His Imperial Majesty."

97
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,090
Please leave me.

98
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,322
Not you, Jorah.

99
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,204
It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay
isn't going quite as planned.

100
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,285
You could sail for Westeros
and leave it all behind.

101
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,203
A boy sits on the Iron Throne.

102
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,365
A boy many believe to be
a bastard with no right to it.

103
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,847
They've never been more vulnerable.

104
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,651
You counselled me against
rashness once in Qarth.

105
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,329
I didn't listen.

106
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,371
That all worked out well.

107
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,161
How can I rule seven kingdoms

108
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,007
if I can't control Slaver's Bay?

109
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,890
Why should anyone trust me,

110
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,528
follow me?

111
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,090
You're a Targaryen,

112
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,322
the Mother of Dragons.

113
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,402
I need to be more than that.

114
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,008
I will not let those I have freed
slide back into chains.

115
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,682
I will not sail for Westeros.

116
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,729
What, then?

117
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,407
I will do what queens do.

118
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,088
I will rule.

119
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,323
Pull up your hood.

120
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,528
A memorable shade.

121
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,609
But how would they know?

122
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,321
You know what kind of stories
poor men enjoy the most?

123
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,165
Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.

124
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,921
Is this the only way into the Eyrie?

125
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,207
The mountains are impassable.

126
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,568
If you want to get to the Eyrie,
you need to go through the Bloody Gate.

127
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,086
It doesn't matter how large your army is,

128
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,970
if you attack this gate,
you do it on this road,

129
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,929
three men abreast,

130
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,526
and get slaughtered like goats.

131
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,490
The first Lords of the
Vale didn't have much,

132
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,360
but they had these mountains
and they knew how to use them.

133
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,249
And the fortress they built here
has never been overcome.

134
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,130
Not once in 1,000 years.

135
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,010
Know your strengths, use them wisely,

136
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,163
and one man can be worth 10,000.

137
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,769
Who would pass the Bloody Gate?

138
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,764
Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece Alayne.

139
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,800
Stand to.

140
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,167
Stand to!

141
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,121
Welcome back, Lord Baelish.

142
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,568
Uncle Petyr!

143
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,924
My lord.

144
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,845
Oh.

145
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,570
I have brought you a gift.

146
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,365
Lord Baelish.

147
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,046
- My lady.
- Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.

148
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,691
A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.

149
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,371
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance,
Lady Arryn.

150
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,920
- My name is...
- Oh, do take down that hood, child.

151
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,684
Don't you think I know who you are?

152
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,889
You think I'd let my intended
leave the Eyrie on urgent business

153
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,126
without knowing what that business was?

154
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,405
I let him go so he could
bring you here to me.

155
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,561
My flesh and blood.

156
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,482
It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa.

157
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,688
You mustn't call me that
in front of anyone else.

158
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,525
- I understand.
- No one can know you're here.

159
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,728
It would put us in a very
precarious position.

160
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,371
I would never say a thing.

161
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,647
The Lannisters want to destroy us.

162
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,842
They've been trying for years.

163
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,889
Now they know what it feels like.

164
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,601
Mummy said they killed your mother
and they chopped off your brother's head.

165
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,884
They did, and my father's.

166
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,726
They killed my father, too, with poison.

167
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,089
I wanted to make the little
Lannister baby man fly,

168
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,969
but Mother said I couldn't.

169
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,804
Make him fly?

170
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,726
Through the Moon Door.

171
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,721
And on top of everything else,

172
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,167
they made you marry that filthy troll.

173
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,881
They made us both.
Lord Tyrion didn't want to.

174
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,849
I don't believe that.

175
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,969
Did he force himself on you?

176
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,286
- No. We never...
- Good.

177
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,610
Robin, this is your cousin Sansa.

178
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,648
But you're not to call her Sansa
in front of anyone

179
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,768
but Uncle Petyr and myself.
Do you understand?

180
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,964
Sansa, this is my son Robin.

181
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,289
It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin.

182
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,446
Robin, show Sansa to her chamber.
Take the back stairs.

183
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,641
Go. We'll speak soon.

184
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,049
What took you so long?

185
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,805
Arranging for the ascension
of King Tommen I,

186
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,327
extricating Sansa, getting her here alive.

187
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,610
She's here. We've spent more than
enough time on her for one evening.

188
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,404
Let's get married tonight.

189
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,251
Ought we not...

190
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,926
...inform the Lords of the Vale
about the ceremony?

191
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,809
There's only one Lord of the Vale.

192
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,723
The others can all hang.

193
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,930
Lurking and simpering on the stairs
like buzzards the moment my husband died,

194
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,651
- trying to get their claws in me.
- I do think that we could wait until...

195
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,401
I'm done waiting, Petyr.

196
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,768
We had our wedding night many years ago.

197
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,046
Or don't you remember?

198
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,681
Like it was yesterday.

199
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,084
What wife would do for you
the things I've done?

200
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,210
What wife would trust you
the way I've trusted you?

201
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,888
When you gave me those drops

202
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,406
and told me to pour them into Jon's wine,

203
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,050
my husband's wine.

204
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,249
When you told me to write a letter to Cat

205
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,765
telling her it was the...

206
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,730
The deed is done.

207
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,005
Faded into nothing.

208
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,321
Only speaking of it can make it real.

209
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,446
Tonight it is, then.

210
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,450
Let me bathe and dress for the occasion.

211
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,248
Once I'm presentable,
I'll call on the Septon immediately.

212
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,001
I'm warning you.

213
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,482
I'm going to scream when
my husband makes love to me.

214
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:58,928
So loud they'll hear me
clear across the Narrow Sea.

215
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,009
When will the wedding take place
in your mind?

216
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,969
As soon as decency permits.

217
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,728
After we've allowed Tommen
the appropriate time to mourn his brother

218
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,484
and Margaery to mourn her husband.

219
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,723
- A fortnight?
- That seems reasonable.

220
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,009
No jugglers, no jousting dwarves,

221
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,361
no 77-course meals.

222
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,769
And your wedding to Loras?

223
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,565
Shortly after Tommen's.

224
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,847
- Shortly?
- A fortnight.

225
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,602
I know you don't like them.

226
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,802
I didn't like your husband.

227
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,281
Used to pat me on the back a lot.

228
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,646
I didn't trust him.

229
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,690
We had that in common.

230
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,243
You don't need to make formal alliances
with people you trust.

231
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,846
Then whom can we trust?

232
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,528
Ourselves alone.

233
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,522
The Tyrells

234
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,730
are our only true rivals
in terms of resources

235
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,963
and we need them on our side.

236
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,805
Robert wasn't particularly rich.

237
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,526
Robert had me funding him.

238
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,050
Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.

239
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,567
I suppose that explains
why we did so well in the last one.

240
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,321
Do you know how much gold was mined
in the Westerlands this past year?

241
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,526
Haven't a clue.

242
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,284
Your best guess.

243
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,088
Pounds, tons, ounces?

244
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,401
Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.

245
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,120
Can't be.

246
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,170
Our last working mine ran
dry three years ago.

247
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,402
Then how do we pay for anything?

248
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,610
The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos
a tremendous amount of money.

249
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,170
How much?

250
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,842
A tremendous amount.

251
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,922
There must be someone at the Iron Bank
you can speak to, come to some arrangement.

252
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,368
The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank.
There is no someone.

253
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,011
Someone does work there.
It is comprised of people.

254
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,242
And a temple is comprised of stones.

255
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,529
One stone crumbles
and another takes its place.

256
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,924
And the temple holds its form
for 1,000 years or more.

257
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,524
That's what the Iron Bank is, a temple.

258
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,082
We all live in its shadow
and almost none of us know it.

259
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,487
You can't run from them.
You can't cheat them.

260
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,723
You can't sway them with excuses.

261
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,441
If you owe them money
and you don't want to crumble yourself,

262
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,124
you pay it back.

263
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,046
Vesting the Tyrells in the crown
will help a great deal.

264
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,606
It's for the good of the family,
I understand that.

265
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,322
I'm not sure my brothers do.

266
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,849
I know you're building a strong case
against Tyrion.

267
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,086
And as a mother, that is your right.

268
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,529
But as a judge,
I cannot discuss the trial with you.

269
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,922
I respect that.

270
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,204
We don't need to discuss it.

271
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,086
The Lannister legacy
is the only thing that matters.

272
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,561
You've started wars to protect this family.

273
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:42,004
Turned your back on Jaime
for refusing to contribute to its future.

274
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,521
What does Tyrion deserve

275
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,768
for lighting that future on fire?

276
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,966
Joffrey.

277
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,963
Cersei.

278
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,281
Walder Frey.

279
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,407
Meryn Trant.

280
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,124
Tywin Lannister.

281
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,248
The Red Woman.

282
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,685
Beric Dondarrion.

283
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,281
Thoros of Myr.

284
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,691
Ilyn Payne.

285
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,560
The Mountain.

286
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,610
Would you shut up?

287
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,210
I can't sleep until I say the names.

288
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,807
The names of
every fucking person in Westeros?

289
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,524
Only the ones I'm going to kill.

290
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,129
Hate's as good a thing as any
to keep a person going.

291
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,202
Better than most.

292
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,730
We come across my brother,

293
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,644
maybe we can both cross
a name off our list.

294
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,366
If he were here right
now, what would you do?

295
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,405
I'd tell him to shut the fuck up
so I can get some sleep.

296
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,842
Go on, get it over with,
your list of doomed men.

297
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,208
I'm almost done.

298
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,642
Only one name left.

299
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,130
Go on.

300
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,761
The Hound.

301
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,406
Thank you.

302
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,369
Your mother always had a sweet tooth.

303
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,010
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

304
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,163
At suppertime,
she would go straight for honey cakes,

305
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,890
candied almonds, custard.

306
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,405
Anything sweet.

307
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,849
Eventually, your grandfather had to assign
a septa to watch her at meals.

308
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,366
Cat was the firstborn daughter after all.

309
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,005
It was important that she remain desirable

310
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,651
so Father could arrange
a good match for her

311
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,326
and she was starting to get fat.

312
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,971
My mother fat?

313
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,281
She never let me have my pudding
until I'd finished all my proper food.

314
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,603
This is before she married your father
and moved to the North.

315
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:20,207
By the time you were born,
your father's austerity had become hers.

316
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,162
Marriage changes people.

317
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,961
I didn't mean for you to stop. Enjoy them.

318
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,969
How do you like them?

319
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,008
They're delicious.

320
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,486
Where did you get the lemons?
You can't grow them up here.

321
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,164
Oh, gods, no.

322
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,449
Petyr had three crates
brought all the way from King's Landing.

323
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,568
He knew you liked lemon cakes.

324
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,926
He's so kind.

325
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,765
He really cares for you.

326
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,763
Think where you'd be without him.

327
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,161
In their clutches, on trial for murder.

328
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,526
Yes. I'm very lucky.

329
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,125
He feels responsible for you.

330
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,931
- Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful.
- Why?

331
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,201
Why does he feel responsible for you?

332
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,963
Well, I'm half Tully.
He loved your family so much.

333
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,121
- Loved your mother.
- No.

334
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,770
That's what you wanted to say.

335
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,811
- He loves you, Aunt Lysa. He's married to you.
- Your mother never loved him.

336
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,565
Cat always went straight for
the sweetest thing.

337
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,644
The most obvious thing. Your Uncle Brandon.

338
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,963
Your handsome, arrogant,
cruel Uncle Brandon.

339
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,202
He almost killed Petyr in a duel.

340
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,442
And your mother loved him anyway.

341
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,320
And now Petyr is risking
his life to save you,

342
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,801
the daughter of a woman
who didn't love him.

343
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,089
No more than those whores in his brothels.

344
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,845
- Has he told you about them?
- No.

345
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,651
He hasn't told you about
the vile things they do with their bodies,

346
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,047
they let him do with their bodies?

347
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,884
- Never.
- Are you pregnant?

348
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,569
What? No, I told you.
Lord Tyrion and I never...

349
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,449
I wasn't asking about Tyrion.

350
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,443
What have you let Petyr do with your body?

351
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,171
- Aunt Lysa, no, I...
- Your young, pretty body.

352
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,084
- Nothing. I'm a virgin.
- Don't lie to me.

353
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,446
You're hurting me.

354
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,765
I'll know if you lie.

355
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,364
I'm a virgin, I swear it.

356
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,249
He loves you, Aunt Lysa.

357
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,209
All he says is that I'm stupid.

358
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,363
I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams
who never learns,

359
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,568
and I'm a terrible liar,
so I should always tell the truth.

360
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,961
And I swear to you that
he has never touched me.

361
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,281
Not once, not ever.

362
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,883
It's all right.

363
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,928
It will all be all right.

364
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,490
You'll be a widow soon.

365
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,927
They'll execute that dwarf
for murdering the king

366
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,048
and you'll be free to marry Robin.

367
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,327
You'll be the Lady of the Vale.

368
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,641
Hmm.

369
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,122
Didn't they teach you how to ride a horse?

370
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,806
Yes, my lady, when I was young.

371
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,689
There wasn't much call for it
with Lord Tyrion, though.

372
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,325
He preferred litters.

373
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,926
Perhaps you should have stayed with him.

374
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,361
It's not going to be
a pleasant journey for you.

375
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,810
It could take weeks to get to the Wall,
depending on the weather.

376
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,571
That's a long way off.

377
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,849
Well, Lady Sansa's
brother's at Castle Black.

378
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,890
If I were her, that's where I'd go.

379
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,689
Feel free to stop at any point.

380
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,650
Never, my lady. I'm your squire.

381
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,166
I've made it this far in the world
without a squire.

382
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,685
I don't see why I need one now.

383
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,923
- All knights have squires, my lady.
- I'm not a knight.

384
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,010
And I'm not a slaver, either.
I don't own you.

385
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,367
I swore an oath, my lady.

386
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,408
I am releasing you from that oath.

387
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,843
That means you could leave.

388
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,081
I know.

389
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,771
What do you think will happen if you leave?

390
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,046
They'll say I wasn't a very good squire.

391
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,003
- The hell you doing?
- Practising.

392
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,209
- What, ways to die?
- No one's going to kill me.

393
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,123
They will if you nance around like that.

394
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,644
That's no way to fight.

395
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,644
It's not fighting. It's water dancing.

396
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,730
Dancing?

397
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,007
Maybe you ought to put on a dress.

398
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,281
Who taught you that shite?

399
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,249
The greatest swordsman who ever lived.

400
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,408
Syrio Forel, the First Sword
to the Sealord of Braavos.

401
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,891
Braavos.

402
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,644
Greasy-haired little bastard, I bet.

403
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,120
They all are.

404
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,486
What do you know about anything?

405
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,767
I bet his hair is greasier
than Joffrey's cunt.

406
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,808
- It was not.
- Was? He dead?

407
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,881
- Yes.
- How?

408
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,604
- He was killed.
- Who by?

409
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,524
- Meryn Trant. That's why Ser Meryn's on my...
- Meryn Trant?

410
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,403
The greatest swordsman who ever lived
killed by Meryn fucking Trant?

411
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,448
- He was outnumbered.
- Any boy whore with a sword

412
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,363
could beat three Meryn Trants.

413
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,011
Syrio didn't have a sword.
Or armour. Just a stick.

414
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,162
The greatest swordsman who ever lived
didn't have a sword?

415
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,007
All right. You have a sword.
Let's see what he taught you.

416
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,728
Go on, do it for your Braavosi friend.

417
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,882
Dead like all the rest of your friends.

418
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,841
Your friend's dead and Meryn Trant's not

419
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,284
'cause Trant had armour
and a big fucking sword.

420
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,244
Your Grace.

421
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,891
Prince Oberyn. Writing letters?

422
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,211
A poem, actually.

423
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,003
May I show you the gardens?

424
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,050
I couldn't very well refuse a royal escort.

425
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,088
No, you couldn't.

426
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,771
I didn't realise you were a poet.

427
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,002
Not a very good one.

428
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,127
For your paramour?

429
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,964
For one of my daughters.

430
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,407
You have several, don't you?

431
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,681
Eight.

432
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,125
Eight?

433
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,569
Eight daughters?

434
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,563
The fifth is difficult.

435
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,291
I named her after my sister Elia.

436
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,443
- Beautiful name.
- Yes.

437
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,965
But I can't say it without turning sad.

438
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,922
And after I turn sad,

439
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,048
I grow angry.

440
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,964
Perhaps that's why she's difficult.

441
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,887
The gods love their
stupid jokes, don't they?

442
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,327
Which joke is that?

443
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,041
You're a prince of Dorne.

444
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,770
A legendary fighter.

445
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,286
A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros.

446
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,201
But you could not save your sister.

447
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:26,844
I'm a Lannister. Queen for 19 years.
Daughter of the most powerful man alive.

448
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,489
But I could not save my son.

449
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:35,003
What good is power
if you cannot protect the ones you love?

450
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,724
We can avenge them.

451
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,280
Yes, we can avenge them.

452
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,531
You really believe Tyrion
murdered your son?

453
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,683
I know he did.

454
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,331
We will have a trial and
we will learn the truth.

455
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,928
We'll have a trial, anyway.

456
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,251
I haven't seen my daughter in over a year.

457
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,607
The last time I saw her,

458
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,684
she was swimming with two of my girls
in the Water Gardens.

459
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,491
Laughing in the sun.

460
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,608
I want to believe that.

461
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,443
I want to believe she's happy.

462
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,602
You have my word.

463
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,721
We don't hurt little girls in Dorne.

464
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,364
Everywhere in the world,
they hurt little girls.

465
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,447
Would you bring her a gift for me?

466
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,244
I wasn't there for her nameday.

467
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,603
I don't know when I'll see her again.

468
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,967
Anything at all.

469
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,531
The best shipwrights in King's Landing
have been working on it for months.

470
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,040
Myrcella loves the open water.

471
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,963
I will have it sailed down
to Sunspear for her.

472
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,449
Please tell her

473
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,202
her mother misses her very much.

474
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,722
Oh, no.

475
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,609
No, no.

476
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,970
Hells.

477
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,280
Gods.

478
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,085
Did you remove the skin?

479
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,165
No, my lady.

480
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,924
Have you ever cooked a rabbit before?

481
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,401
No, my lady.

482
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,126
Did you ever cook anything for Lord Tyrion?

483
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,164
No, my lady.

484
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,645
That was the cooks.

485
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,090
What are you doing?

486
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,003
I'm helping you with your armour.

487
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,970
I've been removing my own armour
for quite some time, thank you very much.

488
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,805
What exactly did you do for Lord Tyrion?

489
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,168
I brought him his meals
and cleared his table when he was finished.

490
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,891
I kept his clothing and linens clean.

491
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,247
Carried his messages
and returned the replies.

492
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,965
Mostly I poured wine.

493
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,964
Whilst in Lord Tyrion's service,

494
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,044
did you ever do anything
remotely related to combat?

495
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,367
I killed a man.

496
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,840
Who?

497
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,921
A Kingsguard.

498
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,203
He tried to kill Lord
Tyrion at the Blackwater.

499
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,361
How did you kill a Kingsguard?

500
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,648
I pushed a spear through
the back of his head.

501
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,648
Bloody ridiculous.

502
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,886
Help me with these straps.

503
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,725
Hey.

504
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,361
Get up.

505
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,411
Get up.

506
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,081
That's it, lad, put it inside.

507
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,003
Get the fire going again.
We're all freezing.

508
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,526
- Aye. We need you in the journey.
- I promise I'll do it.

509
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,568
I've got to have a piss.

510
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,402
Now keep quiet.

511
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,330
You need water.

512
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,081
It doesn't matter.

513
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,002
Of course it matters.

514
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,243
You mustn't let anything stop you.

515
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,728
They already have stopped me.

516
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,687
No.

517
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,929
You're not here.

518
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,327
You're far from here.

519
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,486
What does that mean?

520
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,448
At the hill.

521
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,208
A great weirwood tree.

522
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,966
You've seen it, too.

523
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,485
Meera and I,

524
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,484
even Hodor,

525
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,808
we're only here to guide you.

526
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,562
He's waiting for you.

527
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,404
We have to find it.

528
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,248
You have to make it.

529
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,724
We will.

530
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,371
This isn't the end.

531
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,851
Not for you.

532
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,765
Not yet.

533
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,243
How...

534
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,801
...will we know the end?

535
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,923
You'll know.

536
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,443
Brothers.

537
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,610
You do move quiet.

538
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,207
- How many?
- Eleven men.

539
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,125
Most of them already drunk.

540
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,808
No guards posted. They don't seem
to have a care in the world.

541
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,884
We'll carve them up like walnut pie.

542
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,123
Karl was the top paid cutthroat
in Flea Bottom.

543
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,645
I've seen what he can do with a knife.

544
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,688
Have you seen what I can do with a knife?

545
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,962
Not yet.

546
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,048
There's a hut on the west side of the keep.
We should steer clear of it.

547
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,161
Why?

548
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,722
They've got some hounds chained up inside.

549
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,167
Closer we can get without
the dogs sniffing us, the better.

550
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,088
New moon tonight.

551
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,530
Get some rest.

552
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,170
We move at sundown.

553
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,727
I've always liked a girl with curls.

554
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,643
A touch of class.

555
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,087
You take whatever's left.

556
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,600
Get her up.

557
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,210
Stop.

558
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,930
- Stop. What are you doing?
- Hodor.

559
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,969
- Hodor.
- Stop.

560
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,086
Stop!

561
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,171
- Hodor.
- Stop!

562
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,046
- Please.
- Hodor.

563
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,090
- Please, get off her!
- Hodor.

564
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,401
Please, leave her alone!

565
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,841
Please, stop. Stop.

566
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,931
- What are you doing? Leave her alone!
- Hodor.

567
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,365
No!

568
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,924
Shh, shh, shh.

569
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,731
Shh.

570
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,050
You've got pretty hair, don't you?

571
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,249
Now what is
a pretty little highborn girl like you

572
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,324
doing out here in the deep, dark woods, eh?

573
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,641
You left your daddy's castle
looking for trouble, didn't you?

574
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,848
No dresses for you.

575
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,402
You like it rough, don't you?

576
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,800
You like it in the gutter, don't you?

577
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,166
If you let my sister go, I can help you.

578
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,604
- You can help me?
- I can.

579
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,522
And how you gonna do that?

580
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:50,128
I have the sight. I can see things.

581
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,170
That's very helpful.

582
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,248
Things that haven't happened yet.

583
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,323
What a fine thing.

584
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,080
A fine thing.

585
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,124
Have you seen
what I'm gonna do to your sister?

586
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,646
What they're going to do?

587
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,051
No.

588
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,491
Don't close your eyes.

589
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,325
I saw you die tonight.

590
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,688
I saw your body burn.

591
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,967
I saw the snow fall and bury your bones.

592
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,725
To arms!

593
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,081
They're here, the Night's Watch.

594
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,201
Rescue party is here, lads.

595
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,767
Lady.

596
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,411
- Is Jon with you?
- Aye.

597
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,049
I'll take you to him.

598
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,406
You're Brandon Stark?

599
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,924
Hodor.

600
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,651
The little crippled lord.
We're going for a ride, boy.

601
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,370
Jon!

602
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,762
Keep talking and I'll cut
your friends' throats.

603
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,245
Starting with the idiot.

604
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,803
Do you hear?

605
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,568
Hodor!

606
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,520
Hodor.

607
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,089
Hodor.

608
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,366
Hodor.

609
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,209
Hodor.

610
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,121
Hodor, get his knife. Cut me loose.

611
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,250
- Hodor, get his knife.
- Hodor.

612
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,841
Cut me loose, Hodor.

613
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,969
Jojen and Meera, free them.

614
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,491
Go!

615
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,007
Jon.

616
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,284
Jon!

617
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,569
If he sees you, he won't let you go north.

618
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,611
- He's my brother.
- And wants to protect you.

619
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,808
He'll take you back to Castle Black.

620
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,484
They're coming from that way as well!

621
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,763
You have to decide.

622
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,929
Do you want to find the three-eyed raven?

623
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,131
- Hodor.
- Hodor.

624
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,690
We need to free Summer.

625
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,443
And we need to go.

626
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,964
Lord Snow.

627
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,284
Are you bringing me back for trial?

628
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,571
We had a good thing here.

629
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,120
We were free men.

630
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,481
You'll never be free.

631
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,801
You'll never know what that's like.

632
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,605
You learn how to fight in a castle?

633
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,008
Some old man teach you how to stand,

634
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,445
how to parry?

635
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,568
How to fight with honour?

636
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,564
You know what's wrong with honour?

637
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,009
You.

638
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,449
Are you all right?

639
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,642
Come with me.

640
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,764
Come on.

641
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,682
We lost four brothers?

642
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,481
Five.

643
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,601
What the seven hells
could do that to a man?

644
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,048
I count 10 dead mutineers.

645
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,408
Locke said there were 11 of them.

646
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,130
Where's Rast?

647
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,607
- Here's another.
- Jon.

648
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,604
Where in seven hells?

649
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,121
Come here.

650
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,922
I missed you, boy.

651
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,363
What should we do with this lot?

652
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,286
It's not safe for you here on your own.

653
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:39,127
Mance Rayder has an army heading this way
and there's worse out there than Mance.

654
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:44,244
Come with us to Castle Black.

655
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,971
We can find you work. Keep you safe.

656
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,725
Meaning all respect, ser crow,

657
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,849
Craster beat us and worse.

658
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,166
Your brother crows beat us and worse.

659
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,249
We'll find our own way.

660
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,970
You want to stay here?

661
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,046
In Craster's Keep?

662
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,165
Burn it to the ground

663
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,167
and all the dead with it.

1
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,966
Your Grace, if you'd like
to sit, I'm sure that...

2
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,247
We've been here since midday.

3
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,482
Easterners have a different sense of time.

4
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,565
Once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan
here in Braavos.

5
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,206
Together, we were going to run
three shiploads of the finest...

6
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,440
Welcome to the Iron Bank.

7
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,569
Please, sit.

8
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,644
What can we do for you, Lord Stannis?

9
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,203
This is Stannis of the House Baratheon,

10
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,444
King of the Andals and the First Men,

11
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,171
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

12
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,366
The Iron Throne is currently occupied
by Tommen of the House Baratheon,

13
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,249
King of the Andals and the First Men,

14
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,005
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

15
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,683
He shares no blood with me.

16
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,370
He is a bastard born of incest.

17
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,284
- As was his brother before him.
- Yes.

18
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,805
We have heard this story.

19
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,531
It's not a story. It's the truth.

20
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,522
The king's grandfather
tells a different story.

21
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,290
A story about a jealous uncle

22
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,966
whose attempts to usurp the throne
from the rightful king

23
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,849
cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly

24
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,566
in blood and gold.

25
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,364
Gold you loaned him.

26
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,490
And you feel your blood gives you
a claim on our gold?

27
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,203
More than any man living.

28
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,486
Across the Narrow Sea, your books are
filled with words like "usurper"

29
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,882
and "madman" and "blood right."

30
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,131
Here, our books are filled with numbers.

31
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,681
We prefer the stories they tell.

32
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,643
More plain.

33
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,003
Less open to interpretation.

34
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,204
How many fighting men remain loyal to you?

35
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,520
4,000.

36
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,409
And how many ships do you have?

37
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,522
- Uh...
- The ones still afloat, Ser Davos,

38
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,921
not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.

39
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,690
- Thirty-two.
- And how much wheat and barley

40
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,650
and beef and pork
do you produce on Dragonstone

41
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,487
to feed your 4,000 men on your 32 ships?

42
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,681
None.

43
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,930
You can see why these numbers
seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending

44
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,286
from our perspective.

45
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,602
I'm afraid
we must respectfully decline your request.

46
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,281
But we thank you for
paying us the honour of your visit.

47
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,765
- My lord.
- I'm not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth.

48
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,524
You would not be either here.

49
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,928
In Braavos,

50
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,646
thieves are not rewarded with titles.

51
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,365
I didn't do the thieving.

52
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,090
That would be the pirates.

53
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,323
I just moved what they stole
from one place to another.

54
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,209
This is the payment that was demanded
by King Stannis for my crimes.

55
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,648
I consider it an honest accounting.

56
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,207
He's an honest man and
he's your best chance

57
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,044
to get back the money
you've sunk into Westeros.

58
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,364
Which is a lot. Wars are expensive.

59
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,082
- The war is over.
- As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over.

60
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,927
Who's the real power in King's Landing?

61
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,684
- Ser Davos...
- Humour me.

62
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,170
- Tywin Lannister.
- How old is Tywin Lannister?

63
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,327
Sixty-seven.

64
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,370
And when he dies, who's in command?

65
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,771
A half-grown boy,

66
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,604
the product of incest?

67
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,729
Cersei Lannister,
a queen whose people despise her?

68
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,801
Jaime Lannister,

69
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,805
a man best known for killing the king
he was sworn to protect?

70
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,483
When Tywin's gone, who do you back?

71
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,129
That is a problem for another time.

72
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,602
I think it's a problem for now.

73
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,451
There's only one reliable leader left
in Westeros.

74
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,570
Stannis.

75
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,165
He's got the birthright.

76
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,163
He's in his prime.

77
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,288
He's a tried and tested battle commander.

78
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,603
And he doesn't just talk about
paying people back, he does it.

79
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,924
The lookout sees a pirate ship
sailing their way.

80
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,002
The captain shouts to his first mate,

81
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,929
"Bring me my red shirt."

82
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,810
The first mate brings the red shirt
and the captain puts it on.

83
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,564
And when the pirates try to board,

84
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,642
the brave captain leads his men to victory.

85
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,563
A few days later, the lookout screams,

86
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,483
"Two pirate ships!"

87
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,485
The crew is shivering like scared mice.

88
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,369
But the courageous captain hollers,

89
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,204
"Bring me my red shirt!"

90
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,362
After the battle, the first mate asks,

91
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,161
"Captain, why do you call for
your red shirt before battle?"

92
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,890
The captain replies,

93
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,646
"So that if I am stabbed,
you will not see me bleed."

94
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,451
The next morning the lookout screams,

95
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,286
"Ten pirate ships! We are surrounded!"

96
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,168
The crew goes silent.

97
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,686
They all look to their brave captain,

98
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,762
waiting for his usual command.

99
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,763
Calm as ever, the captain bellows...

100
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,207
"Bring me my brown pants!"

101
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,528
You think they ever met a pirate
who didn't tell them that joke?

102
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,689
Davos.

103
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,282
I heard you were rotting in a dungeon
in Dragonstone.

104
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,681
Only half rotted.

105
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,325
Join us, my friend.

106
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,361
This is Lhara.

107
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,930
- And this is...
- I am Lhara.

108
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,728
She's an artist, this one, truly.

109
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,004
No time, I'm afraid. We sail at sunrise.

110
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,521
We?

111
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,682
You, me. We.

112
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,125
Once I thought this man loved me.

113
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,407
Now I know he despises me.

114
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,769
He wants to see me die poor
and alone on some cold...

115
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,610
You won't be alone. And you won't be poor.

116
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,171
There's a chest of the good stuff
left back at your house.

117
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,081
I gave it to your wife.

118
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,721
You're not my friend, my friend.

119
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,205
I'll see you at sunrise.

120
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:21,129
"I give you until the full moon
to order all ironborn scum out of the North

121
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,727
"and back to those shit-stained rocks
you call home.

122
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,964
"On the first night of the full moon,

123
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,805
"I will hunt down
every islander still on our lands

124
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,689
"and flay them living,

125
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,890
"the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum
I found at Winterfell.

126
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,086
"In the box you'll find a special gift.

127
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,162
"Theon's favourite toy.

128
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,251
"He cried when I took it away from him.

129
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,651
"Leave the North now
or more boxes will follow with more Theon."

130
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,326
Signed, "Ramsay Snow,

131
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,563
"natural born son of Roose Bolton,

132
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,130
"Lord of the Dreadfort

133
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,965
"and Warden of the North."

134
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,089
Yes!

135
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,649
They skinned our countrymen

136
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,087
and they mutilated my brother,

137
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,444
your prince.

138
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,683
Your prince!

139
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,409
Everything they've done to him,
they've also done to you.

140
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,005
Yes!

141
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,880
As long as they can hurt our prince
with impunity,

142
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,885
the word "ironborn" means nothing.

143
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,723
Go left.

144
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,722
- Theon Greyjoy.
- I don't know...

145
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,644
I'm here for Theon Greyjoy.
Take me to the dungeons.

146
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,644
He's not in the dungeons.

147
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,764
- Last cage on the right.
- Thank you.

148
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,805
This way!

149
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,167
We're going home.

150
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,041
No!

151
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,082
It's all right. It's me, Yara.

152
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,288
You can't trick me.

153
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,362
Tell him you couldn't trick me.

154
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,408
I'm not tricking you, Theon.
I'm saving you.

155
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,931
Not Theon! Reek!

156
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,604
- My name is Reek!
- They're here.

157
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,967
- If they catch us in here, we're trapped.
- Help me with him.

158
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,089
No, you can't!

159
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,571
You're Theon Greyjoy.

160
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,725
No, I don't believe her! I know who I am!

161
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,804
I'm Reek! Loyal Reek!

162
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,724
Good Reek! I've always been Reek!

163
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,244
This is turning into a lovely evening.

164
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,446
I'm Reek! Loyal Reek!

165
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,364
Theon!

166
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,848
Give me my brother
and no more of your men will die.

167
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,400
You've got bigger balls than he ever did.

168
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,761
But with those big balls of yours,

169
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,241
how fast can you run?

170
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,330
- Make for the ship, now.
- But your brother?

171
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,883
My brother is dead.

172
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,411
I have a treat for you.

173
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,164
A reward.

174
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,804
Reward?

175
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,161
Yes, Reek.

176
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,120
Those creatures who came in the night,

177
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,726
they wanted to take you away.

178
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,689
And you didn't let them.

179
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,162
You remained loyal.

180
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,290
I didn't want them to take me.

181
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,408
I was so scared.
I didn't want them...

182
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,562
Yes, Reek.

183
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,521
It's a bath.

184
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,006
For you.

185
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,325
Remove those rags.

186
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,689
Now.

187
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,563
The britches, too, Reek. Take them off.

188
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,481
Do you love me, Reek?

189
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,042
Yes, of course, my lord.

190
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,525
Good.

191
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,925
Because I need you to do something for me.
Something very important.

192
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,242
There's a castle.

193
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,170
Some bad men hold this castle.

194
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,324
I need your help to take this castle back.

195
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,605
But how can...

196
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,209
I need you to play a role.

197
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,241
To pretend to be someone you're not.

198
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,202
Pretend to be who?

199
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,611
Theon Greyjoy.

200
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,286
You stand before Daenerys Stormborn
of the House Targaryen,

201
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,800
the First of Her Name,

202
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,967
the Unburnt,

203
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,605
Queen of Meereen,

204
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,089
Queen of the Andals and the First Men,

205
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,448
Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea,

206
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,003
Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons.

207
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,962
Don't be afraid, my friend.

208
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,284
The Queen says you may approach and speak.

209
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,170
He is a goatherd.

210
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,528
He says he prayed for your victory
against the slave masters.

211
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,082
I thank him for his prayers.

212
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,808
It was your dragons, he says.

213
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,091
They came this morning for his flock.

214
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,806
He hopes he has not offended Your Grace,
but now he has nothing.

215
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,447
Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship.

216
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,127
I cannot bring back his goats...

217
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,888
...but I will see he is paid their value
three times over.

218
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,328
Send the next one in.

219
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:49,490
The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq begs
an audience with the Queen.

220
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:57,603
The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq can
speak to me himself.

221
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,005
Queen Daenerys.

222
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,050
Tales of your beauty were not exaggerated.

223
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,281
I thank you.

224
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,523
Mine is one of the oldest
and proudest families in Meereen.

225
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,127
Then it is my honour to receive you.

226
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,167
My father,

227
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,801
one of Meereen's most respected
and beloved citizens,

228
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,407
oversaw the restoration and maintenance
of its greatest landmarks.

229
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,005
This pyramid included.

230
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,841
For that, he has my gratitude.
I should be honoured to meet him.

231
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,570
You have, Your Grace.

232
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,051
You crucified him.

233
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,527
I pray you'll never live to see
a member of your family treated so cruelly.

234
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,968
Your father crucified innocent children.

235
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,726
My father spoke out
against crucifying those children.

236
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,644
He decried it as a criminal act,
but was overruled.

237
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,964
Is it justice to answer
one crime with another?

238
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,568
I am sorry you no longer have a father,

239
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,201
but my treatment of the
masters was no crime.

240
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,800
You'd be wise to remember that.

241
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,201
What's done is done.

242
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,090
You are the queen
and I am a servant of Meereen.

243
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,642
A servant who does not wish to see
its traditions eradicated.

244
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,449
- And what traditions do you speak of?
- Of funeral rite.

245
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,961
Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces.

246
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:31,763
My father and 162 noble Meereenese
are still nailed to those posts,

247
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,242
carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun.

248
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,130
Your Grace, I ask that you
order these men taken down

249
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,441
so that they might receive proper burials.

250
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,605
And what of the slave children
these noble Meereenese crucified?

251
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,286
They were rotting in the sun as well.

252
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,603
Would you have begged me
for their right to a proper burial?

253
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,604
Your Grace, I cannot defend
the actions of the masters.

254
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,321
I can only speak to you
as a son who loved his father.

255
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,881
Let me take his body down.

256
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,450
Let me have him brought to the temple

257
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,366
and buried with dignity so that he
might find peace in the next world.

258
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,602
Bury your father, Hizdahr zo Loraq.

259
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,564
Thank you, my queen.

260
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,486
How many more?

261
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,730
There are 212 supplicants waiting,
Your Grace.

262
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,731
212?

263
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,641
Send the next one in.

264
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,205
These meetings aren't
always going to be this early, are they?

265
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,240
I was up late last night.

266
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,245
So, does this mean
I am a master of something now?

267
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,169
Coins, ships?

268
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,681
Lord Tywin and I already determined that

269
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,923
I shall be the Master of Ships
long before you...

270
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,205
Lord Tywin, it's a great honour to have
been granted a seat on this council. I...

271
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,282
The trial begins this afternoon.

272
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,522
We only have the morning
for affairs of state.

273
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,250
So, shall we begin?

274
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,803
Sandor Clegane has been spotted
in the Riverlands, my lord.

275
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,291
A coward and a traitor.

276
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,285
My birds tell me
the Hound slaughtered five of our soldiers.

277
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,284
I believe the phrase
"fuck the king" was uttered.

278
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,930
Disgraceful.

279
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,048
What would it take to
make the common soldier

280
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,088
stupid enough to try his
luck with the Hound?

281
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,811
Ten silver stags
seems a generous bounty.

282
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,731
Make it 100. What else?

283
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,246
More whispers from the east, my lord.

284
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,367
The Targaryen girl?

285
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,924
Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen.

286
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,408
She has conquered the city
and rules as its queen.

287
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,720
Conquered with what?

288
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,928
She commands an army of Unsullied,
my queen.

289
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,128
Some 8,000 strong.

290
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,090
She has a company of sellswords,
the Second Sons.

291
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,247
She has two knights advising her,

292
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,563
Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy.

293
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,529
And she has three dragons.

294
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,931
Baby dragons.

295
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,321
Larger every year, Your Grace.

296
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,603
Mormont is spying on her for us.

297
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,809
No longer.
He appears to be fully devoted to her.

298
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,405
As for Ser Barristan,

299
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:43,205
it would seem he took his dismissal from the
Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated.

300
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,930
He's an old man.

301
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,929
He wasn't fit to protect my son.

302
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,691
Joffrey didn't die on his watch.

303
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,604
Dismissing him was
as insulting as it was stupid.

304
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,082
Don't tell me you're worried about
a child halfway across the world.

305
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,448
A child with
two seasoned warriors counselling her

306
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,126
and a powerful army at
her back, Your Grace.

307
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,282
Lord Varys is right.

308
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,648
I have been to Essos
and seen the Unsullied firsthand.

309
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,564
They are very impressive
on the battlefield.

310
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,404
Less so in the bedroom.

311
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,131
Dragons haven't won a war in 300 years.

312
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,771
Armies win them all the time.

313
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,040
She must be dealt with.

314
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,530
How, my lord? By force?

315
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,523
Eventually, if it comes to that.

316
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,723
Can your little birds
find their way into Meereen?

317
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,730
Most certainly, my Lord Hand.

318
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:37,528
Mmm. Lord Tyrell, be a good man.
Fetch my quill and paper.

319
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,523
Prince Oberyn.

320
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,925
Lord Varys.

321
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,210
Only Varys. I'm not actually a nobleman.

322
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,726
No one is under obligation to call me lord.

323
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,450
And yet everyone does.

324
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,561
You seem quite knowledgeable
about the Unsullied.

325
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,529
Did you spend much time in Essos?

326
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,490
Five years.

327
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,965
May I ask why?

328
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,485
'Tis a big and beautiful world.

329
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:29,246
Most of us live and die in the same corner
where we were born

330
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,130
and never get to see any of it.

331
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,808
I don't want to be most of us.

332
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,644
Most of us aren't princes.

333
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,528
You are from Essos.

334
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,450
Where? Lys?

335
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,410
I have an ear for accents.

336
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,289
I've lost my accent entirely.

337
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,691
I have an ear for that as well.

338
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,086
Hmm.

339
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,962
How did you get here?

340
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,485
It's a long story.

341
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,526
One you don't like telling people.

342
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,289
People I trust.

343
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,330
My paramour Ellaria,
she would find you very interesting.

344
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,687
You should come to the
brothel and meet her.

345
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,969
We brought our own wine,
not the swill they serve here.

346
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,010
We have some lovely boys
on retainer, but...

347
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,968
You did like boys before?

348
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,090
Really?

349
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,525
Girls? Hmm.

350
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,686
I hope you won't be offended when I say
I never would have guessed.

351
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,285
Not at all.

352
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,204
But I was never interested
in girls, either.

353
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,806
- What then?
- Nothing.

354
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,360
Everybody is interested in something.

355
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,010
Not me.

356
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,324
When I see what desire does to people,
what it's done to this country,

357
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,085
I am very glad to have no part in it.

358
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,727
Besides, the absence of desire

359
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,804
leaves one free to pursue other things.

360
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,405
Such as?

361
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,611
Let me guess, I've been pardoned.

362
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,889
Really?

363
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,845
Father's orders.

364
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,527
Well, we mustn't disappoint Father.

365
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,923
Kingslayer!

366
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,482
I, Tommen of the House Baratheon,

367
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,925
First of my Name,

368
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,606
King of the Andals and the First Men,

369
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,762
and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,

370
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,686
do hereby recuse myself from this trial.

371
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:15,329
Tywin of the House Lannister,
Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,

372
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,046
will sit as judge in my stead.

373
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,121
And with him Prince Oberyn
of the House Martell

374
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,010
and Lord Mace of the House Tyrell.

375
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,211
And if found guilty,

376
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,124
may the gods punish the accused.

377
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,721
Tyrion of the House Lannister,

378
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,765
you stand accused by
the Queen Regent of regicide.

379
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,889
Did you kill King Joffrey?

380
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,761
No.

381
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,002
Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?

382
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,603
Not that I know of.

383
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,851
How would you say he died, then?

384
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,889
Choked on his pigeon pie.

385
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,444
So you would blame the bakers?

386
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,000
Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.

387
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,044
The crown may call its first witness.

388
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,726
Once we'd got King Joffrey
safely away from the mob,

389
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,370
the Imp rounded on him.

390
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,522
He slapped the king across the face

391
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,365
and called him a vicious idiot and a fool.

392
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,761
It wasn't the first time
the Imp threatened Joffrey.

393
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,809
Right here in this throne room,

394
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,770
he marched up those steps
and called our king a halfwit.

395
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,642
Compared His Grace to the Mad King
and suggested he'd meet the same fate.

396
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,961
And when I spoke in the king's defence,

397
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,644
he threatened to have me killed.

398
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,246
Oh, why don't you tell them
what Joffrey was doing?

399
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,767
- Silence.
- Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark

400
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,524
while you tore at her clothes and beat her.

401
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,648
Silence!

402
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,964
You will not speak unless called upon.

403
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,642
You're dismissed, Ser Meryn.

404
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,211
"Basilisk venom,

405
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,647
"widow's blood,

406
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,603
"wolfsbane,

407
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,405
"essence of nightshade,

408
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,721
"sweetsleep,

409
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,087
"tears of Lys,

410
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,003
"demon's dance..."

411
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,091
"...blindeye..."

412
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,242
I think you have made your point,
Grand Maester.

413
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,089
You have a lot of poison in your store.

414
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,925
Had, Prince Oberyn.

415
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,923
My stores were plundered.

416
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,650
By whom?

417
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,726
By the accused, Tyrion Lannister,
after he had me wrongfully imprisoned.

418
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,121
Grand Maester,

419
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:14,091
you examined King Joffrey's corpse.

420
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,562
Was it without question
poison that killed him?

421
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,201
Without question.

422
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:27,765
This was found on the body
of Dontos Hollard, the king's fool.

423
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:33,609
He was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark,
the wife of the accused,

424
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,569
away from the feast.

425
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:41,205
She wore this necklace
the day of the wedding.

426
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,602
Residue of the most rare
and terrible poison

427
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,570
was found inside.

428
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,570
Was this one of the poisons
stolen from your store?

429
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,723
It was. The strangler.

430
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,484
A poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess.

431
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,968
And used to strike down
the most noble child

432
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,930
the gods ever put on this good earth.

433
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,968
"I will hurt you for this.

434
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,930
"A day will come when
you think you are safe and happy

435
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,606
"and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth

436
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,682
"and you will know the debt is paid."

437
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,121
Your own brother said this to you?

438
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,684
Shortly before the Battle
of Blackwater Bay.

439
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,845
I confronted him about his plans
to put Joffrey on the front lines.

440
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,366
As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff
insisted on remaining at the battlements.

441
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,126
He believed his presence
would inspire the troops.

442
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,883
Tyrion said,

443
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,088
"And you will know the debt is paid."

444
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,246
What debt?

445
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,962
I discovered he'd been keeping whores
in the Tower of the Hand.

446
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,771
I asked him to confine his salacious acts

447
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,320
to the brothel where
such behaviour belongs.

448
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,166
He wasn't pleased.

449
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,245
Thank you, Your Grace,
for the courage of your testimony.

450
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,403
Do you remember
the precise nature of this threat?

451
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,488
I'm afraid I do, my lord.

452
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,007
He said, "Perhaps you should speak
more softly to me, then.

453
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,923
"Monsters are dangerous

454
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,606
"and just now kings are dying like flies."

455
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,763
And he said this to you
at a meeting of the Small Council?

456
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,046
Yes.

457
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,289
After we received word
of Robb Stark's death.

458
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,840
He didn't seem gladdened by the news.

459
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,048
Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark

460
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,407
had made him more sympathetic
to the northern cause.

461
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,001
You're excused, Lord Varys.

462
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,842
Father, may I ask the witness one question?

463
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,566
One.

464
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,924
You once said

465
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,561
that without me,
this city would have faced certain defeat.

466
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,281
You said the histories
would never mention me,

467
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,002
but you would not forget.

468
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,682
Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?

469
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,161
Sadly, my lord,

470
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,242
I never forget a thing.

471
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,607
We will adjourn for now.

472
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,480
Toll the bells in an hour's time.

473
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,562
Clear the court!

474
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,127
You'd condemn
your own son to death?

475
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,328
I've condemned no one.
The trial is not over.

476
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,890
This isn't a trial. It's a farce.

477
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,201
Cersei has manipulated everything
and you know it.

478
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,691
I know nothing of the sort.

479
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,127
- You've always hated Tyrion.
- He killed his king.

480
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,202
As did I.

481
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,647
Do you know the last order
the Mad King gave me?

482
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,610
To bring him your head.

483
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,126
I saved your life
so you could murder my brother?

484
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,680
- It won't be murder. It'll be justice.
- Justice?

485
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,123
I'm performing my sworn duty
as Hand of the King.

486
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,766
If Tyrion is found guilty,
he will be punished accordingly.

487
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,684
- He'll be executed.
- No, he'll be punished accordingly.

488
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,449
Once you said, "Family is what lives on.

489
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,806
"All that lives on."

490
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,889
You told me about
a dynasty that would last 1,000 years.

491
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,725
What happens to your dynasty
when Tyrion dies?

492
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,721
I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by
oath to carry on the family line.

493
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,131
I'm well aware.

494
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,202
What happens to your name?

495
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,889
Who carries the lion banner
into future battles?

496
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,803
Your nephews?

497
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,609
Lancel Lannister?

498
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,729
Others whose names I don't even remember?

499
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,771
What happens to my dynasty if I spare
the life of my grandson's killer?

500
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,241
It survives through me.

501
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,121
I'll leave the Kingsguard.

502
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,204
I'll take my place as your son and heir

503
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,442
if you let Tyrion live.

504
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,851
Done.

505
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,929
When the testimony's concluded
and a guilty verdict rendered,

506
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,843
Tyrion will be given the chance to speak.

507
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,686
He'll plead for mercy.
I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch.

508
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,286
In three days' time,
he'll depart for Castle Black

509
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,089
and live out his days at the Wall.

510
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,885
You'll remove your white cloak immediately.

511
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,610
You will leave King's Landing

512
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,047
to assume your rightful place
at Casterly Rock.

513
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,888
You will marry a suitable woman

514
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,804
and father children named Lannister.

515
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,566
And you'll never turn your back
on your family again.

516
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,121
You have my word.

517
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,884
And you have mine.

518
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,284
Not going well, is it?

519
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,521
You're going to be found guilty.

520
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,568
- Oh, you think so?
- And when you are,

521
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,928
you need to enter a formal plea for mercy
and ask to be sent to the Wall.

522
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,803
Father's agreed to it.

523
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,611
He'll spare your life
and allow you to join the Night's Watch.

524
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:12,041
Ned Stark was promised the same thing
and we both know how that turned out.

525
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,168
Father is not Joffrey.
He'll keep his word.

526
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,890
How do you know?

527
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,485
Do you trust me?

528
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,691
Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts.

529
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,205
This will all be over soon.

530
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,121
The crown may call its next witness.

531
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,725
State your name.

532
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,440
Shae.

533
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,525
Do you swear by all the gods that
your testimony will be true and honest?

534
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,326
I swear it.

535
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,045
Do you know this man?

536
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,091
Yes. Tyrion Lannister.

537
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,846
How do you know him?

538
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,129
I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa.

539
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,441
This man stands accused
of murdering King Joffrey.

540
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,565
What do you know of this?

541
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,767
I know that he's guilty.

542
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,322
He and Sansa planned it together.

543
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,004
Silence!

544
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,608
Continue.

545
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,366
She wanted revenge for her father,
her mother, her brother.

546
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,564
She blamed their deaths on the king.

547
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,126
Tyrion was happy to help.

548
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:26,081
He hated Joffrey. He hated the queen.

549
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,685
He hated you, my lord.

550
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,011
He stole poison from
the Grand Maester's chamber

551
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,366
to put in Joffrey's wine.

552
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,281
How could you possibly know all this?

553
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:40,081
Why would he reveal
such plans to his wife's maid?

554
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,242
I wasn't just her maid.

555
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,925
I was his whore.

556
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,520
I beg your pardon?

557
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,524
You said you were his...

558
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,201
His whore.

559
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,527
How did you come to be in his service?

560
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,045
He stole me.

561
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:05,203
I was with another man,
a knight in your lordship's army.

562
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,081
But when Tyrion arrived at the camp, he
sent one of his cutthroats into our tent.

563
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,566
He broke the knight's arm
and brought me to Lord Tyrion.

564
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,405
"You belong to me now," he said.

565
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:21,371
"I want you to fuck me like
it's my last night in this world."

566
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,531
Silence!

567
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,450
And did you?

568
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,890
Did I what?

569
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,691
Fuck him like
it was his last night in this world?

570
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,241
I did everything he wanted.

571
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,402
Whatever he told me to do to him.

572
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,323
Whatever he felt like doing to me.

573
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,923
I kissed him where he wanted.
I licked him where he wanted.

574
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,209
I let him put himself where he wanted.

575
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,009
I was his property.

576
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:56,364
I would wait in his chambers for hours
so he could use me when he was bored.

577
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,363
He ordered me to call him
"my lion," so I did.

578
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,563
I took his face in my hands and said,

579
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,564
"I am yours and you are mine."

580
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,161
Shae.

581
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,763
Please don't.

582
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,205
I am a whore.

583
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,485
Remember?

584
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,041
That was before he married Sansa.

585
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,044
After that, all he wanted was her.

586
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,521
But she wouldn't let him into her bed.

587
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,204
So he promised to kill
King Joffrey for her.

588
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,484
Father,

589
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,003
I wish to confess.

590
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,690
I wish to confess.

591
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,047
You wish to confess?

592
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,571
I saved you.

593
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,767
I saved this city

594
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:12,447
and all your worthless lives.

595
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,969
I should have let Stannis kill you all.

596
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,606
Tyrion.

597
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,127
Do you wish to confess?

598
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,444
Yes, Father.

599
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,522
I'm guilty.

600
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,604
Is that what you want to hear?

601
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,523
You admit you poisoned the king?

602
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,649
No, of that I'm innocent.

603
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,611
I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime.

604
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:47,684
I am guilty of being a dwarf.

605
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,520
You are not on trial for being a dwarf.

606
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,887
Oh, yes, I am.

607
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,806
I've been on trial for that my entire life.

608
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,407
- Have you nothing to say in your defence?
- Nothing but this...

609
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,440
I did not do it.

610
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,126
I did not kill Joffrey,

611
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,726
but I wish that I had.

612
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,406
Watching your vicious bastard die

613
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:17,644
gave me more relief than
1,000 lying whores.

614
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:25,083
I wish I was the monster you think I am.

615
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:30,046
I wish I had enough poison
for the whole pack of you.

616
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:34,489
I would gladly give my life
to watch you all swallow it.

617
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,642
Ser Meryn.

618
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,326
Escort the prisoner back to his cell.

619
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,283
I will not give my life
for Joffrey's murder.

620
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,449
And I know I'll get no justice here.

621
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,683
So I will let the gods decide my fate.

622
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,648
I demand a trial by combat.

1
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,409
I made a deal for you,

2
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,450
to keep your ungrateful head
on your neck a little while longer.

3
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,170
I'm sorry, what am I grateful for?

4
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,211
The opportunity to live and die at the Wall
as punishment for a crime I did not commit?

5
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,408
You threw your life away.

6
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,645
It's not a joke.
You understand that, don't you?

7
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,883
Of course it's a joke,
just not a very funny one.

8
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,646
I couldn't listen to her
standing there, telling her lies.

9
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,525
I couldn't do it.

10
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,970
You fell in love with a whore.

11
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,606
Yes.

12
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,604
And I was stupid enough to think
that she had fallen in love with me.

13
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,126
That deal you made,

14
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,009
it was everything Father wanted.

15
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,847
You do see that? He gets
you back as his heir.

16
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,002
The future Lord of the Rock.

17
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,766
And he ships me off to Castle Black,
out of sight at last.

18
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,165
All so perfect.

19
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,366
It felt good to take that from him.

20
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,845
He knows I'm innocent
and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway.

21
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,081
He's willing to sacrifice any of us.

22
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,161
Not you.

23
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,488
You're the golden son.

24
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,642
You could kill a king, lose a hand,

25
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,927
fuck your own sister,
you'll always be the golden son.

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,240
Careful.

27
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,287
I'm the last friend you've got.

28
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,966
At least I got to tell
them what they really are.

29
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,963
Yes, brilliant speech.

30
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,561
They'll be talking about
it for days to come.

31
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,884
I thought you were a realist.

32
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,807
Didn't realise you'd die for pride.

33
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,087
Don't give up on me just yet.

34
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,010
I survived one trial by combat,
even though you weren't there to save me.

35
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,287
I can't save you this time either.

36
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,568
My training has proved that I can't
beat a stable boy with my left hand.

37
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,641
Where's your sense of adventure?

38
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,723
Even if you lose, imagine the look
on Father's face when you fall.

39
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,407
Our family name snuffed out
with a single swing of the sword.

40
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,050
It is tempting.

41
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,769
Well...

42
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,650
Bronn fought for me once,
he'll do it again.

43
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,047
If he wins,

44
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,566
I expect I'll be in his debt
for the rest of my life.

45
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,527
If he wins.

46
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,521
Will you find him for me?

47
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,647
Who does Cersei plan
on naming as a champion?

48
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,370
I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant.

49
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,843
I'd enjoy watching Bronn
disembowel that pompous child beater.

50
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,127
No.

51
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,645
Not Ser Meryn.

52
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,045
Go on, move it.

53
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,325
And you.

54
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,207
Come on.

55
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,846
Mercy.

56
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,920
Please.

57
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,765
Please, mercy.

58
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,691
Ser Gregor.

59
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,411
Welcome to the capital.

60
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,771
Thank you for riding here so quickly.

61
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,088
You seem to be in good form.

62
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,285
Who am I fighting?

63
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,645
Does it matter?

64
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,805
Could be food.

65
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,044
Could be soldiers.

66
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,685
You shouldn't be sitting
out here like this.

67
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,609
Where else to sit?

68
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,971
Tried to walk back to me hut,

69
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,530
hurt too much.

70
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,001
Then I remembered they burned me hut down.

71
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,363
Who were "they"?

72
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,687
I stopped asking a while ago.

73
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,481
That's not going to get better.

74
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,966
Doesn't seem so.

75
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,806
A bad way to go.

76
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,524
Haven't you had enough?

77
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,161
Of what?

78
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,045
I know.

79
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,370
Time to go.

80
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,529
Take matters into me own hands.

81
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,881
The thought has occurred to me.

82
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,690
So why go on?

83
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,081
Habit.

84
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,442
Nothing could be worse than this.

85
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,564
Maybe nothing is worse than this.

86
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,406
Nothing isn't better or
worse than anything.

87
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,448
Nothing is just nothing.

88
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,686
Who are you?

89
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,846
My name is Arya.

90
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,251
Arya Stark.

91
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,761
You her father?

92
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,765
Her captor.

93
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,761
Bringing her to her aunt for ransom.

94
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,560
A fair exchange, that is.

95
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,804
Always held to the notion of fair exchange
in all my dealings.

96
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,130
You give me, I give you.

97
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,681
Fair.

98
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,411
A balance.

99
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,968
No balance any more.

100
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,722
Could I have a drink?

101
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,929
Dying is thirsty work.

102
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,681
Wish it were wine.

103
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,326
So do I.

104
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,208
That's where the heart is.

105
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,041
That's how you kill a man.

106
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,685
The fuck you doing?

107
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,609
There's a price on your head.

108
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,524
Guess that's what the king does
when you tell him to fuck off.

109
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,001
The king's dead.

110
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,211
He drank poisoned wine at his own wedding.

111
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,090
The bounty on you
is for killing Lannister soldiers.

112
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,605
A hundred silver stags.

113
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,603
And you thought you were
going to collect it?

114
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,044
Didn't think very hard, did you?

115
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,600
You were Yoren's prisoners
when he was taking me to the Wall.

116
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,844
He told me he'd fuck me
bloody with a stick.

117
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,410
This day's really not working out
the way you planned.

118
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,643
He on your little list?

119
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,645
He can't be.

120
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,769
I don't know his name.

121
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,121
What's your name?

122
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,644
- Rorge.
- Thank you.

123
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,164
You're learning.

124
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,409
Rangers returning!

125
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,810
They return!

126
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,320
- Rangers returning!
- Greetings.

127
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,164
Didn't think I'd see you again.

128
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,446
All right, Jon?

129
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,601
Welcome back, brother.

130
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,605
Lord Snow.

131
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,371
This is no place for wild beasts.
Lock him away,

132
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,921
or I'll let Hobb throw
him in tonight's stew.

133
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,929
Come on, Ghost.

134
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,605
Mance's army was closing in
on Craster's Keep when we left.

135
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,842
We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill.

136
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,729
They'll reach the Wall
before the next full moon.

137
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,406
I'm surprised you didn't ride over
and say hello.

138
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,448
The King-beyond-the-Wall
is your old friend, isn't he?

139
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,851
We need to prepare.

140
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,251
We've been preparing.

141
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,691
We should seal the tunnel.

142
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,167
Plug it with rocks and ice.
Flood it and let it freeze.

143
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,210
And how would we range north?

144
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,970
- We wouldn't.
- Coward!

145
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,643
You would cut off our legs,
pluck out our eyes,

146
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,361
leave us cowering behind the Wall
hoping for the storm to pass?

147
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,171
We can't defend the gate
against 100,000 men.

148
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,006
This castle has stood
for thousands of years.

149
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,084
The Night's Watch has defended her
for thousands of years.

150
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,130
And in all those centuries,
we have never sealed the tunnel.

151
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,407
Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser?

152
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,641
I have.

153
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,445
The tunnel's gate won't stop them.

154
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,921
The bars on those gates
are four inches thick.

155
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,490
Cold-rolled steel.

156
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,528
And they won't stop them.

157
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,004
Remind me which order you belong to,
Lord Snow.

158
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,767
The stewards.

159
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,923
Are the stewards responsible
for maintaining the tunnel?

160
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,367
No.

161
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,885
Who would that be?

162
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,002
- The builders.
- Ah, the builders.

163
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,211
First Builder Yarwyck,

164
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,808
Lord Snow here recommends
sealing the tunnel,

165
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,647
leaving us unable to carry out our duties
as sworn brothers of the Night's Watch.

166
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,964
Do you agree with him?

167
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,961
No.

168
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,804
Given your deep knowledge
of the wildling army, Lord Snow,

169
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,924
you and Tarly will take night duties
atop the Wall until the full moon.

170
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,400
Moving on.

171
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,087
First Builder, we'll need 100 barrels
of pitch brought atop the Wall.

172
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,161
Aye.

173
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,926
My lord.

174
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,210
You have new clothes.

175
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,130
Do you like 'em? Eh?

176
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,930
Gloves are doeskin.

177
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,371
Softer than a virgin's thighs.

178
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,249
I sent for you days ago.

179
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,482
- I've been a bit busy.
- Doing what?

180
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,127
My lonesome bachelor days are over.

181
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,969
I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.

182
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,570
Lollys Stokeworth?

183
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,244
She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.

184
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,042
I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.

185
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,531
She's dim-witted.

186
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,364
If I wanted wits, I'd marry you.

187
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,125
When my sister arranged this love match,

188
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,286
did she mention
that Lollys has an older sister?

189
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,051
Falyse.

190
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,730
Aye, I did know.

191
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,643
And you understand the
rules of inheritance?

192
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,210
Falyse is 40 and barren.

193
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,682
She still gets Castle Stokeworth
when her father dies.

194
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,046
She does.

195
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,600
Unless she happens to perish
before her father.

196
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,842
Then Lollys gets the castle.

197
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,604
What? Ladies fall from their horses
and snap their pretty necks all the time.

198
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,087
You and my sister deserve each other.

199
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,161
Why did you bother to come here?

200
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,280
You once said if anyone ever asked me
to sell you out, you'd double their price.

201
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,249
Is it two wives you want or two castles?

202
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,321
One of each will do.

203
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,243
But if you want me
to kill the Mountain for you,

204
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,765
it'd better be a damn big castle.

205
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,890
I'm a bit short on castles at the moment.
But I can offer you gold and gratitude.

206
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,770
I have gold.

207
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,120
What can I buy with gratitude?

208
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,202
You might be surprised.

209
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,601
A Lannister always pays his debts.

210
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,045
Your sister's a Lannister, too.

211
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,282
My wife is heir to Winterfell.

212
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,487
If I emerge from this
with my head still on my shoulders,

213
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,570
I may one day rule the North in her name.

214
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,811
I could carve you out a big piece of it.

215
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,809
If and may and could.

216
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,682
It's bloody cold up north.

217
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,650
Lollys is soft and warm. And close.

218
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,487
If I gave you the choice between
fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain,

219
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,881
you'd have your britches down
and your cock out before I could blink.

220
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,561
Does he frighten you so much?

221
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,961
I'd be a bloody fool if
he didn't frighten me.

222
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,327
He's freakish big and strong.

223
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,482
And quicker than you'd expect
for a man of that size.

224
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,247
Maybe I could take him,

225
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,321
dance around
until he's so tired of hacking at me,

226
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,688
he dropped his sword,
get him off his feet somehow.

227
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,844
But one misstep

228
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,365
and I'm dead.

229
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,889
Why should I risk it?

230
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,931
Because you're my friend.

231
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,969
Aye, I'm your friend.

232
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,331
And when have you ever risked your life
for me?

233
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,324
I like you,

234
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,562
pampered little shit that you are.

235
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,051
I just like myself more.

236
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,970
I understand.

237
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,526
I'm sorry it has to be this way.

238
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,284
Why are you sorry?

239
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,284
Because you're an evil bastard
with no conscience and no heart?

240
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,129
That's what I liked about
you in the first place.

241
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,605
We had some good days together.

242
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,284
Yes, we did.

243
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,601
What will you do?

244
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,082
I suppose I'll have to
kill the Mountain myself.

245
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,641
Won't that make for a great song?

246
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,486
I hope to hear them sing it one day.

247
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,851
How did you get in here?

248
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,524
Your door is well guarded,

249
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,484
but your window is not.

250
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,086
I swam to an island a
mile offshore for these.

251
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,124
Don't do that again.

252
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,205
Never met a woman
who didn't like wildflowers.

253
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,123
These are my private quarters.

254
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,521
If I want you here, I will summon you.

255
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,961
Forgive me, my queen. I live to serve you.

256
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,568
Tell me why you're here.

257
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,401
I came to ask a favour.

258
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,490
I only have two talents in this world.

259
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,085
War and women.

260
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,804
You are staying here in Meereen to rule.
That is a wise decision. I respect it.

261
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,082
But here in Meereen,
I cannot pursue my talents.

262
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,687
I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the
streets to stop the revenge killings.

263
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,321
You've ordered us to be night watchmen.

264
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,767
And as for women,

265
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,162
there are thousands in Meereen
you can pursue.

266
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,964
There is only one,

267
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,522
and she does not want me.

268
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,560
You swore me your sword.

269
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,007
My sword is yours till the day I die.

270
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,721
So if I command you to stay in Meereen
and patrol the streets?

271
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,730
I'll stay in Meereen and
patrol the streets.

272
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,244
Send me to kill your enemies.

273
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,288
Any enemy anywhere.

274
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,842
Let me do what I do best.

275
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,125
Very well.

276
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,324
Do what you do best.

277
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,489
Take off your clothes.

278
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,961
Oh.

279
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,490
Come in, my queen. Please.

280
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,410
I didn't mean to disturb you, my lady.

281
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,806
You could never.

282
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,962
I just wanted to speak
with you before we left.

283
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,525
Could you bring me that vial over there?

284
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,407
The blue one.

285
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,002
No, not that one.

286
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,409
You don't even want to touch that one.

287
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,051
Next to it.

288
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,090
That's the one.

289
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,645
When I looked into the flames this morning,
the Lord spoke to me.

290
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,848
He said,

291
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,847
"Tonight, you will have your last good bath
in a long while.

292
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,570
"Make it count."

293
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,003
A joke.

294
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,650
Not a very good one, I'm afraid.

295
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,767
It was. I...

296
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,367
Humour isn't my strength.

297
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,525
That's because most jokes are lies
and you're devoted to the truth.

298
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,964
If they're lies, my lady,
aren't they best avoided?

299
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,731
Not always.

300
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,726
Most of these powders and potions

301
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,801
are lies.

302
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,926
Deceptions to make men think
they witnessed our Lord's power.

303
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,367
Once they step into his light,
they will see the lie for what it was,

304
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,920
a trick that led them to the truth.

305
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,523
A pinch of this powder in a bonfire

306
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,161
will send a flaming column
screaming towards the sky.

307
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,167
And this one creates a black smoke

308
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,447
that will make the bravest man
piss himself with fear.

309
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,967
And a drop of this in any man's wine
will drive him wild with lust.

310
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,723
Did you use it with Stannis?

311
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,847
No.

312
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,846
Don't be upset.

313
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,321
Men never crave what they already have.

314
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,647
It's only flesh.

315
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,044
It needs what it needs.

316
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,680
No act done in service of the Lord
can ever be called a sin.

317
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,084
I thank God every day
for bringing you to us.

318
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,924
And Stannis to you.

319
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,361
He wants to bring Shireen with us.

320
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,480
I think that would be ill-advised.

321
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,326
My daughter has heretical tendencies,
as you're well aware.

322
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,722
I don't know if her doubt is real
or simply meant to spite me,

323
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,883
but whichever the case,
she should stay home.

324
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,008
I understand how you feel.

325
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,209
But that is impossible.

326
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,407
Why?

327
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,489
You don't need powders and potions,
my queen.

328
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,961
You don't need lies.

329
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:12,921
You are strong enough to look into the
Lord's light and see his truth for yourself.

330
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,962
However harsh it is.

331
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,486
However hard for us to understand.

332
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,043
You don't need my help,
but I will need yours soon.

333
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,443
When we set sail,
your daughter must be with us.

334
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,924
The Lord needs her.

335
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,890
Jorah the Andal.

336
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,567
Are you here to see our queen?

337
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,049
She's in a good mood.

338
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,768
Khaleesi.

339
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,962
- You're here early.
- Later than some.

340
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,211
- You don't approve?
- It's not a question of approval,

341
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,770
it's a question of trust.

342
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,524
You neither approve nor trust.

343
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,409
Why would I? The man's a sellsword.

344
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,007
Didn't you fight for the Golden Company
before pledging your sword to my brother?

345
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,570
I did.

346
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,766
I trust you.

347
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,360
Daario Naharis killed his captains

348
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,728
and dumped their heads at your feet
when he grew tired of their commands.

349
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,723
How could you ever have faith
in a man like that?

350
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,122
I could never have faith
in a man like Daario.

351
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,288
That's why I've sent him and the
Second Sons to retake Yunkai.

352
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,848
- You have?
- I have.

353
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,888
Without you there to rule, Khaleesi,

354
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,247
I fear the masters will
simply bide their time,

355
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,561
wait for the invaders to leave
and reassert control.

356
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,406
That is why I've ordered Daario
to execute every master in Yunkai.

357
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,691
The masters tear babies
from their mothers' arms.

358
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,161
They mutilate little boys by the thousands.

359
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,641
They train little girls
in the art of pleasuring old men.

360
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,690
They treat men like beasts,
as you said yourself.

361
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,168
Herding the masters into pens
and slaughtering them by the thousands

362
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,322
is also treating men like beasts.

363
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,764
The slaves you freed,
brutality is all they've ever known.

364
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,205
If you want them to know something else,

365
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,085
you'll have to show it to them.

366
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,926
And repay the slavers with what? Kindness?
A fine? A stern warning?

367
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,765
It's tempting to see
your enemies as evil, all of them,

368
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,491
but there's good and evil
on both sides in every war ever fought.

369
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,245
Let the priests argue over good and evil.

370
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,004
Slavery is real.

371
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,929
I can end it. I will end it,

372
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,401
and those behind it.

373
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,960
I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi.

374
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:53,251
And now you are helping me
show them to freedom.

375
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,721
I wouldn't be here to help you
if Ned Stark had done to me

376
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,571
what you want to do to
the masters of Yunkai.

377
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,206
The man who came to me the other day
about burying his father.

378
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,688
Hizdahr zo Loraq?

379
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,486
He will accompany the Second Sons
and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai.

380
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,325
He will tell the masters
what has happened in Meereen.

381
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,882
He will explain
the choice they have before them.

382
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,761
They can live in my new world
or they can die in their old one.

383
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,771
Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves.

384
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,251
Tell him I changed my mind.

385
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,929
Yes, Khaleesi.

386
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,440
No.

387
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,651
Tell him you changed my mind.

388
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,889
Rat cunts.

389
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,127
Fucking whore.

390
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,130
You're doing it wrong.

391
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,561
You need to burn away
that horrible bit there.

392
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,120
Otherwise it's gonna get
infected and fester.

393
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,285
I know you don't like fire,
but if you don't do it right...

394
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,089
No fire.

395
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,009
It'll only take a second.

396
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,200
- It won't hurt that much.
- No fire!

397
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,609
Shut up about it.

398
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,807
About everything.

399
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,522
Thanks to you, I'm a walking bag of silver
anywhere the Lannisters hold sway.

400
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,851
Which is everywhere between
where we are now and where we're going.

401
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,682
I'm as stupid as that hog
you stuck back in the village,

402
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:10,090
getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten.

403
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,882
No reward is worth this much trouble.

404
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,801
Wish I'd never laid eyes on you.

405
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,766
You say your brother gave you that sword.

406
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,368
My brother gave me this.

407
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,527
It was just like you said a while back.

408
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,365
Pressed me to the fire like
I was a nice juicy mutton chop.

409
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,241
Why?

410
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,209
Thought I stole one of his toys.

411
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,567
I didn't steal it. I was
just playing with it.

412
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,609
The pain was bad.

413
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,451
The smell was worse.

414
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,445
But the worst thing was that
it was my brother who did it.

415
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,205
My father, who protected him,

416
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,926
told everyone my bedding caught fire.

417
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,967
You think you're on your own?

418
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,641
Let me wash it out
and help you sew it up at least.

419
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,648
Bit of comfort never hurt anyone.

420
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,087
We've been sleeping in ditches
the last few weeks.

421
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,164
I think we can treat ourselves to
a featherbed for the night

422
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,527
and a hot meal not cooked by you.

423
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,886
Couldn't agree more, my lady.

424
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,361
Just don't start expecting
silk underclothes.

425
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,647
- Not working for your former lord any longer.
- Yes, my lady.

426
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,122
Don't get drunk.

427
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,561
No, my lady.

428
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,971
Can I get you anything else?

429
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,849
No, this will do nicely, thank you.

430
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,331
Kidney pie is wonderful.

431
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,330
Thanks.

432
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,524
I do my best.

433
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,482
A good kidney pie is all
about the ingredients.

434
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,843
Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk.

435
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,763
Easy enough. But the meat,

436
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,571
peacetime or not, getting your hands on
a good bottom round steak

437
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,284
and calves' kidneys is not easy.

438
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,091
I mean, some people settle
for plain old beef kidneys.

439
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,800
Got no right to cook anything, them.
Oh, and the gravy.

440
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,643
Don't get me started on the gravy.

441
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,131
Very difficult to get right.

442
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,964
See, a lot of people give up on the gravy.

443
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,168
You cannot give up.

444
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,725
No gravy, no pie.

445
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,564
Simple as that.

446
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,648
That's nice armour. Are you a knight?

447
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,205
No.

448
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,409
Oh, it's just people with armour
are usually knights.

449
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,051
Generally speaking.
From King's Landing, though, aren't you?

450
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,970
From there myself originally.
Flea Bottom born and bred.

451
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,202
What brings you to these parts?

452
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,761
We're looking for someone.

453
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,286
Someone in particular?
Maybe they came in here.

454
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,647
A lot of people come in here.
Just the other day we had 17...

455
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,802
A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty.

456
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,043
Her name is Sansa Stark,
but she may be using a different name.

457
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,291
Starks?

458
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,842
What, like them lot from "Winterhell"?

459
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,848
No, ain't seen anyone like that.

460
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,410
I heard they was all traitors.

461
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,810
Don't need no traitors in here.

462
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,168
I pledged my life to their mother
Catelyn Stark.

463
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,242
I swore to her I'd bring
her daughters home.

464
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,686
Sure I can't get you a bit more kidney pie?

465
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,242
- What?
- It's nothing, my lady.

466
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,730
You wouldn't be screwing your face up
like that if it was nothing.

467
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,962
Don't want to offend, my lady.
Truly, I don't.

468
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,769
You're not interesting
enough to be offensive.

469
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,605
The Lannisters want Lady Sansa.

470
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,648
The Lannisters have money.

471
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,684
People kill for money.

472
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,124
I don't think we should be telling people
we're searching for Lady Sansa.

473
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,050
My lady. My lord. Could I have a word?

474
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,647
- What about? Not kidney pie.
- You seem like a proper lady.

475
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,843
Someone who could be trusted.

476
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,968
I never met no Sansa Stark.

477
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,290
But I know her sister.

478
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,961
Arya.

479
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,368
No one's seen Arya Stark
since her father was beheaded.

480
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,249
She's presumed dead.

481
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,609
She weren't when I last spoke to her.

482
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,206
- When was that?
- Heading up north with the Night's Watch.

483
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,964
She was all dressed up as a boy.

484
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,520
Like your ladyship, only
without the armour.

485
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,489
Going by the name Arry.

486
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,210
- So what happened to her?
- Well...

487
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,486
The quick version.

488
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,649
The Lannisters took us prisoner.

489
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,930
We escaped.

490
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,970
The Brotherhood took us prisoner.
They sold me to the innkeep.

491
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,842
They were gonna sell Arya to her mother
at Riverrun along with another prisoner.

492
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,766
Big ugly fellow. Foul mouth and
a face like a half-burnt ham.

493
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,729
- Not friendly.
- The Hound.

494
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,087
That's the one.

495
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,443
If you find her, could you give her this?

496
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,081
She liked the last one I gave her,
but, well, this one turned out better.

497
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,211
Um...

498
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,203
You were saying?

499
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,451
Her mother's dead,
grandfather's dead,

500
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,961
Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun.

501
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,530
The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun.

502
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,443
They'll take her to the Eyrie, my lady.

503
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,645
Why the Eyrie?

504
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,722
Her aunt, Lysa Arryn.

505
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,487
Catelyn Stark's sister.

506
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,723
She's Arya's last living
relative with money.

507
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,087
She hates the Lannisters.

508
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,090
Lord Tyrion made sure
I knew which house married which

509
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,083
and who hated who.

510
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,845
Sansa could be there, too.

511
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,924
Could be.

512
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,329
You sure about this?

513
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,245
No.

514
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,450
I imagined
you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.

515
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,048
I did spend some time with an absolutely
stunning blonde the other day.

516
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,600
Mmm. Do tell.

517
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,844
I've got every kind of filth down here
except the kind I like.

518
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,845
Your sister.

519
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,961
Oh.

520
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,971
Cersei approached me.

521
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,162
We spoke a great deal about her daughter.

522
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,326
How worried your sister is about her.

523
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:22,009
She was trying very hard to pretend
she had not come to sway me against you.

524
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,731
I think she may have even
believed it herself.

525
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:30,011
Making honest feelings do dishonest work
is one of her many gifts.

526
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,004
It was difficult for her
to hide her true intentions.

527
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,605
It is rare to meet a Lannister

528
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:42,526
who shares my enthusiasm
for dead Lannisters.

529
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,601
She desperately wants to see you killed.

530
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,571
She didn't need to bother you.

531
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,644
It looks as though
I've taken care of that myself.

532
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,761
The joy she will feel when
my head leaves my neck.

533
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,050
She's wanted this for a long time.

534
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,962
Yes, I know.

535
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,963
We met, you and I.

536
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,690
Many years ago.

537
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,642
I think I would have remembered that.

538
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,008
Unlikely. You had just been born.

539
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:21,723
Our father brought me and my sister Elia
with him on a visit to Casterly Rock.

540
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,882
My first time away from Dorne.

541
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,122
I didn't like anything about the Rock.

542
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,406
Not the food, not the weather,
not your accents.

543
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,970
Nothing.

544
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,240
But the biggest disappointment,

545
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,246
you.

546
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,409
You and my family have more in common
than you might admit.

547
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,451
The whole way from Dorne
all anyone talked about was

548
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,605
the monster that had been born
to Tywin Lannister.

549
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,566
A head twice the size of his body,

550
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,324
a tail between his legs,

551
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,562
claws, one red eye,

552
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,531
the privates of both a girl and a boy.

553
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,841
That would have made things so much easier.

554
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,288
When we met your sister,
she promised she would show you to us.

555
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:12,445
Every day we would ask.
Every day she would say, "Soon."

556
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,365
Then she and your brother

557
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,885
took us to your nursery and...

558
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,609
...she unveiled the freak.

559
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,521
Your head was a bit large,
your arms and legs were a bit small,

560
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,887
but no claw.

561
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,440
No red eye. No tail between your legs.

562
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,126
Just a tiny pink cock.

563
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,241
We didn't try to hide our disappointment.
"That's not a monster," I told Cersei.

564
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,521
"That's just a baby."

565
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,731
And she said, "He killed my mother."

566
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:54,044
And she pinched your little cock so hard,
I thought she might pull it off.

567
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,208
Until your brother made her stop.

568
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,681
"It doesn't matter," she told us.

569
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,888
"Everyone says he will die soon.

570
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,809
"I hope they are right.

571
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,366
"He should not have lived this long."

572
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,890
Well,

573
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:18,163
sooner or later,
Cersei always gets what she wants.

574
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,765
And what about what I want?

575
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,682
Justice

576
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,324
for my sister and her children.

577
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,448
If you want justice,

578
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,285
you've come to the wrong place.

579
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,488
I disagree.

580
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,886
I've come to the perfect place.

581
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,126
I want to bring those who have wronged me
to justice.

582
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,090
And all those who have wronged me
are right here.

583
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,008
I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane,

584
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,648
who killed my sister's children

585
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,088
and then raped her
with their blood still on his hands

586
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,891
before killing her, too.

587
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,602
I will be your champion.

588
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,964
Hello, Robin.

589
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,201
What are you doing?

590
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,245
I'm building my home, Winterfell.

591
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:27,325
At least I think I am. I haven't
been back there in a very long time.

592
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,771
Why did you leave?

593
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,321
It's a long story.

594
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,801
I stay here in the Eyrie.

595
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,891
Mother says it's dangerous on the roads
and I have to keep myself safe

596
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,724
because I'm the Lord of the Vale

597
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,167
and a very important person.

598
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,489
Yes, you certainly are.

599
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,805
When will you go back?

600
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,770
Probably never.

601
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:53,970
My family doesn't live there any more
and someone burned it down.

602
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,841
Oh.

603
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,163
Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?

604
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,651
No, I'm afraid not.

605
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,768
It's not high up in the mountains.
It's down on the ground.

606
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,922
That sounds dangerous.

607
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,401
- How do you make people fly?
- We don't.

608
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,010
What do you do with all the bad people

609
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,526
and the scary people
and the people you don't like?

610
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,568
I never did anything with them at all.

611
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,768
Girls didn't take part in that
where I came from.

612
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,121
Well, I'm Lord of the Vale.

613
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,722
When I grow up,
I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me.

614
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,768
Or you. When we get married,

615
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,763
you can tell me if you don't like somebody

616
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,888
and then we can bring them
back here and, whoosh!

617
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,604
Right through the Moon Door.

618
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,289
I like the sound of that.

619
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,089
Let's put a Moon Door in your Winterfell.

620
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,446
All right.

621
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,763
- It can go in here in this big tower.
- Be careful.

622
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,288
You've ruined it. Now I'm going to have to
rebuild the whole thing.

623
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,725
- I didn't ruin it.
- You did.

624
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,723
It was already ruined
because it didn't have a Moon Door.

625
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,485
- I was fixing it.
- Knocking things down isn't fixing them.

626
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,085
- It's ruining them.
- I didn't ruin it!

627
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,162
- You're being stupid.
- I didn't ruin it!

628
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,851
Robin, I'm sorry, I...

629
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,570
Children.

630
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,449
- I hit him.
- Yes, I saw.

631
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,444
- I shouldn't have done that.
- No.

632
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,810
His mother should have, a long time ago.

633
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,048
Consider it a step in the right direction.

634
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,890
If he tells Aunt Lysa...

635
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,201
Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.

636
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,166
I was trying to remember
what everything looked like.

637
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,969
I'll never see it again.

638
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,371
A lot can happen between now and never.

639
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,922
If you want to build a better home,

640
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,850
first you must demolish the old one.

641
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,522
Why did you really kill Joffrey?

642
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,884
Tell me why.

643
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,128
I loved your mother
more than you could ever know.

644
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,761
Given the opportunity,

645
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:18,128
what do we do to
those who've hurt the ones we love?

646
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,680
In a better world,

647
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:34,483
one where love could
overcome strength and duty,

648
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,281
you might have been my child.

649
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,811
But we don't live in that world.

650
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,730
You're more beautiful than she ever was.

651
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,010
Lord Baelish...

652
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,969
Call me Petyr.

653
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,447
You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?

654
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,208
Come here, Sansa.

655
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,561
Do you know how far the fall is?

656
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,561
No.

657
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,208
Neither do I, precisely.

658
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,408
Hundreds of feet.

659
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,650
It's fascinating

660
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,281
what happens to bodies when
they hit the rocks from such a height.

661
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,567
The impact breaks them right apart.

662
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,890
Like eggs dropped on the floor.

663
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,361
Sometimes pieces remain intact.

664
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,331
You'll find the head sitting on its own.

665
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,482
Every hair in place.

666
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,291
Blue eyes staring at nothing.

667
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,920
I know what you did.

668
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,724
I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa.

669
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,007
I never should have hit Robin.

670
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:42,367
- I promise it won't happen...
- Don't be coy with me, you little whore.

671
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,886
You kissed Petyr.

672
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,247
- I didn't. You don't understand.
- I saw you.

673
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,449
You can't lie to me
because I saw it with my own eyes.

674
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,921
- He kissed me. I pulled away.
- Liar! Whore!

675
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,287
He is mine!

676
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,966
My father, my husband, my sister,

677
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,088
they all stood between us
and now they're all dead.

678
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,051
That's what happens to people
who stand between Petyr and me.

679
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,724
Look down!

680
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,043
- Look down!
- Lysa!

681
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,010
Let her go.

682
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,809
You want her?

683
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,724
This empty-headed child?

684
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,801
Let her go.

685
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,163
She's just like her mother.
She'll never love you.

686
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:31,401
I lied for you. I killed for you.

687
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,563
- Why did you bring her here?
- I'll send her away.

688
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,766
I swear on my life.

689
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,446
I swear to all the gods.

690
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,449
Let her go, Lysa.

691
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,246
Oh, my sweet wife.

692
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,322
My sweet, silly wife.

693
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,200
I have only loved one woman,

694
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,086
only one, my entire life.

695
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,846
Your sister.

1
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,521
Here we are.

2
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,923
Ready?

3
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,248
The Rains of Castamere.

4
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,163
You fucking deaf?

5
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,766
Same wrong guess every fucking time.

6
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,365
Listen, you cunt.

7
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,044
Oh!

8
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,242
The Bear and the Maiden Fair.

9
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,841
- Yes!
- There's a man with an ear.

10
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,685
Too bad you got a hangnail for a cock.

11
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,081
First time I saw you with your breeches
down, I thought you were a eunuch.

12
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,521
You've seen it, girls.

13
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,649
Like a baby snail peeking out of its shell.

14
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,967
Your baby was crying this morning.

15
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,290
Woke me up.

16
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,607
- You hear me?
- Yes.

17
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,726
Well, got anything to say?

18
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,768
I'm sorry.

19
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,686
I don't care if you're sorry.

20
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,242
Keep that baby quiet, or I will.

21
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,243
Don't you ever touch him.

22
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,281
Little wildling bitch.

23
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,407
You should have stayed with your own kind.

24
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,281
- Are you listening to me?
- Shut your mouth.

25
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,805
What?

26
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,168
It's just an owl, you dumb bitch.

27
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,765
No, it's not.

28
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,771
Shh.

29
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,090
I should never have left her there.

30
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,645
- You couldn't have known.
- Of course I could've.

31
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,369
They've been raiding the villages close by.

32
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,920
And we just cower in here
while they slaughter our brothers.

33
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,002
Our brothers had orders
to stay at Castle Black.

34
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,081
So it's all right, then?

35
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,687
Black Jack and Kegs and Mully chopped
to pieces 'cause they broke the rules?

36
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,048
I didn't say it was all right.
I'm saying they shouldn't have been there.

37
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,088
We're pledged to guard the realms of men.

38
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,605
She's dead because of me.

39
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,170
We can't even guard Mole's Town.

40
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,208
We can't go after them. You know that.

41
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,361
It's what they want.

42
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,765
And little Sam.

43
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,841
As if I cut their throats myself.

44
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,291
Maybe she managed to hide herself.

45
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,245
I thought all of you was dead.

46
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,607
You went up north with Mormont
and no one came back.

47
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,648
Not for ages.

48
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,290
But then you did.

49
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,250
She survived Craster,
and he was the worst shit I've ever met.

50
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,209
She survived the long march to the Wall.

51
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,729
She survived a White
Walker, for fuck's sake.

52
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,445
She might have got out.

53
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,164
She might have.

54
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,530
If they hit Mole's Town,

55
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,523
then we're next.

56
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,288
Mance and his army must be close.

57
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,691
100,000 of them.

58
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,320
And there's what, 105 of us left?

59
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,923
You counting Black Jack, Kegs, and Mully?

60
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,164
102.

61
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,280
How do 102 men stop 100,000?

62
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,930
Whoever dies last,

63
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,402
be a good lad and burn the rest of us.

64
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,131
Once I'm done with this world,

65
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,364
I don't want to come back.

66
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,608
You think he was spying on you?

67
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,205
No, not spying.

68
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,727
The Dothraki think outsiders are
ridiculous taking shame in the naked body.

69
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,009
They make love under the stars
for the whole khalasar to see.

70
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,001
Yes, Your Grace.

71
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,321
But you are not Dothraki.

72
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,565
No.

73
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,365
Well, I don't see why it matters.

74
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,851
Grey Worm isn't interested.

75
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,161
None of the Unsullied care
what's under our clothes.

76
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,643
He was interested.

77
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,806
What?

78
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,647
I believe he was interested.

79
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,322
When the slavers castrate the boys,
do they take all of it?

80
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,164
All of it?

81
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,611
The pillar and the stones.

82
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,482
I don't know, Your Grace.

83
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,844
Haven't you ever wondered?

84
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,920
Yes, Your Grace.

85
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,169
Missandei.

86
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,809
I have come to apologise.

87
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,088
You don't need to apologise.

88
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,887
I hope I didn't frighten you.

89
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,086
No.

90
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,890
The lessons you give I in Common Tongue,

91
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,805
these are precious to I.

92
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,008
- "To me."
- To me.

93
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,811
I don't remember
teaching you the word "precious."

94
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,963
Jorah the Andal, he teaches I...

95
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,566
He teaches me this word.

96
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,521
Do you remember the name
you were given at birth?

97
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,963
I remember nothing.

98
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,325
Only Unsullied.

99
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,402
When they cut you,

100
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,520
do you remember that?

101
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,009
I'm sorry.

102
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,121
- I'm sorry they did that to you.
- Why?

103
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,246
Why sorry?

104
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,051
It's a terrible thing to do to a boy.

105
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,766
If the Masters never cut me,

106
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,410
I never am Unsullied.

107
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,924
I never stand in the Plaza of Pride

108
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,402
when Daenerys Stormborn orders us
to kill the Masters.

109
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,001
I never am chosen to lead the Unsullied.

110
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,842
I never meet Missandei
from the island of Naath.

111
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,521
I am sorry I...

112
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,610
For today,

113
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,210
I am sorry.

114
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,606
Grey Worm.

115
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,802
I'm glad you saw me.

116
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,846
So am I.

117
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,444
Kraken.

118
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,681
Mmm. Strong, as long as they're in the sea.

119
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,082
When you take them out of the water,
no bones.

120
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,288
They collapse under their proud weight
and slump into a heap of nothing.

121
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,362
You'd think they'd know that.

122
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,125
Unfortunately, they're not very bright.

123
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,360
What do you tell them?

124
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,961
I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon,

125
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,280
heir to the Iron Islands.

126
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,569
- And what are you really?
- I'm Reek.

127
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,043
Are you sure?

128
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,251
You do look very much like a lord.

129
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,609
Formidable, proud.

130
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,241
I'm Reek.

131
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,049
Until when?

132
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,643
Always.

133
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,881
- Forever.
- That's right.

134
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,722
Until you're rotting in the ground.

135
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,370
Remember what you are and what you're not.

136
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,727
Bring me Moat Cailin.

137
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,048
No closer.

138
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,524
Who are you?

139
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,641
I'm Kenning,

140
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,246
commander of this garrison.

141
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,403
And you say you're Theon Greyjoy?

142
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,171
Yes.

143
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,086
And why should I believe that?

144
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,003
I was born on Pyke to Balon Greyjoy.

145
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,247
His third and last living son.

146
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,084
I am your prince.

147
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,288
I swear it by the Drowned God.

148
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,601
What is dead may never die.

149
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,603
What is dead may never die.

150
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,206
And if you were my prince,

151
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,248
why are you marching with a Bolton army?

152
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,364
Lord Bolton took me
captive after Winterfell.

153
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,365
He sent me to treat with you in good faith
as your fellow ironborn.

154
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,169
And what does Lord Bolton want?

155
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,402
You are fading from sickness,

156
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,882
you are badly outnumbered,
and you're hundreds of miles from the sea.

157
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,162
Lord Bolton implores you
to protect your men

158
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,961
and abandon this fortress
you can no longer hold.

159
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:53,001
Do this, and he will be just and fair
with you as he has been with me.

160
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,208
The Boltons will give you
safe passage to the Stony Shore.

161
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,647
He wants us to surrender?

162
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,724
My own father, your king,

163
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,644
surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon.

164
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,121
I watched him bend the knee.

165
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,361
There was no shame there.

166
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,411
He fought with honour, as did you.

167
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,525
"No shame."
"Fought with honour."

168
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,125
I'm sorry, I didn't hear.

169
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,684
"No shame." "Fought with honour."

170
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,321
Only a whipped dog would speak this way.

171
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,046
Or a woman.

172
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,927
Are you a woman, boy?

173
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,321
You don't know...

174
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,323
The ironborn will not surrender.

175
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,243
My name is Reek...

176
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,644
You go tell your master
that, Theon Greyjoy,

177
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,688
or whoever the fuck you are.

178
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,524
Reek.

179
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,921
- What in the hell are you muttering?
- Reek.

180
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,810
Reek.

181
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,689
If we yield, we live?

182
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,445
- Is that what it says on this paper here?
- Yes.

183
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,122
Have your men raise the white flag
and open the gates.

184
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,247
You're going home.

185
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,647
You didn't really think
I'd let them go, did you?

186
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,523
It's fallen out of fashion, flaying.

187
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,648
Sad, but true.

188
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,722
Traditions are important.

189
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,641
Where are we without our history? Eh?

190
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,805
Yes, my lord.

191
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,682
Will we go home now?

192
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,283
I believe we will.

193
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,328
To our new home.

194
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,490
You have foreign blood,
don't you, Baelish?

195
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,082
A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes.

196
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,844
I suppose all of our ancestors
came from somewhere else originally.

197
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,447
Our forebears settled the Vale
thousands of years ago.

198
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,522
We've fought off invaders ever since.

199
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,208
The beauty of the Vale is matched
only by the nobility of its great families.

200
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,524
Lady Arryn often told me that
you were her rock, Lord Royce.

201
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,729
She told me nothing about you, Baelish.

202
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,167
But I didn't need to hear from her.

203
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,049
Moneylender. Whoremonger.

204
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,243
You've been licking
Tywin Lannister's boots so long,

205
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,129
- it's a wonder your tongue's not black.
- My lord...

206
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,410
And when Jon Arryn named you
Master of Coin, no one cared.

207
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,802
Always been a grubby job.
Why not let a grubby man do it?

208
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,971
But when I heard you were lurking here,

209
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,681
- fawning over the Lady Arryn...
- Lady Arryn invited me.

210
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,407
She and I have been close since childhood.

211
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,051
Yes, we all know how close you were.

212
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,885
Lady Arryn's predilections
were her own affair.

213
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,610
Her death is our affair.

214
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,445
Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.

215
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,488
She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that.

216
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,721
But suicide?

217
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,090
She adored that boy of hers.

218
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,640
I don't see her abandoning him.
Not by choice.

219
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,845
Strange that within days
of your arrival,

220
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,888
you've married Lady Arryn

221
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,167
and she's fallen through the Moon Door.

222
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,050
She was always prone to melancholy.

223
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,130
My lady wasn't meant for a world
as brutal as ours.

224
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,929
We were told there was a witness. A girl.

225
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,089
A niece of yours, I believe.

226
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,731
A girl with no learning and scattered wits.

227
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,086
I assure you, she would be of no help.

228
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,969
We'd like to speak with her.

229
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,040
- Let me fetch her.
- No need.

230
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,970
We prefer to
hear her testimony unadulterated.

231
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,530
Come closer, child.

232
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,525
You have nothing to fear from us or him.

233
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,361
Lord Baelish here is your uncle?

234
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,726
Your name is Alayne?

235
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,042
Perhaps you would feel more comfortable
if Lord Baelish left the room.

236
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,565
- My lady...
- I wasn't asking you.

237
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,687
He can stay.

238
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,728
Speak up, girl,
you're not a damn kitchen mouse.

239
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,801
Tell us what you saw.

240
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,481
I'm sorry, Lord Baelish.

241
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,050
I have to tell the truth.

242
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,323
I'll tell you everything.

243
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,200
Please, Alayne, leave nothing out.

244
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,325
My name is not Alayne.

245
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,731
It's Sansa Stark,

246
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,766
eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark.

247
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,402
Lord Royce,
we met when you came to Winterfell.

248
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,083
You were escorting your son Ser Waymar
to the Wall.

249
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,003
Sansa Stark?

250
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,289
You tell lies right to my
face, you little worm?

251
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,204
Lord Baelish has told many lies.

252
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,002
All to protect me.

253
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,324
Since my father was executed,

254
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,449
I have been a hostage in King's Landing.

255
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,846
A plaything for Joffrey to torture
or Queen Cersei to torment.

256
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,131
They beat me, they humiliated me,

257
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,362
they married me to the Imp.

258
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,522
I had no friends in King's Landing,

259
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,809
except one.

260
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,331
He saved me.

261
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,643
Smuggled me away when he had the chance.

262
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,091
He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie
with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa.

263
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,484
But the Lannisters have friends everywhere.

264
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,971
Even the Vale.

265
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,487
He made me swear
not to tell anyone my true name.

266
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,244
Your secret is safe with us, my lady.

267
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,444
Your father grew up
right here in these halls.

268
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,602
We hunted together many times.

269
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,210
He was a fine man.

270
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,130
Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa.

271
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,601
You knew her well, my lords, my lady.

272
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,250
She was a troubled woman.

273
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,247
She always loved Lord Baelish.
She told me herself.

274
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,485
From the moment he arrived
at the gates of Riverrun,

275
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,281
a boy of eight carrying everything
he owned in a little sack.

276
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,530
She confessed to me
she never loved Lord Arryn.

277
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,047
She did as her father commanded,
as so many of us have.

278
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,207
When the gods finally allowed her
to be with Lord Baelish,

279
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,124
she was so happy. For a time.

280
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,768
My aunt was a jealous lady.

281
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,562
She was terrified that
Lord Baelish didn't love her any more.

282
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,564
That he would abandon her
for a younger woman.

283
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,962
And then,

284
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,010
one day she saw him kiss me.

285
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,361
Lady Sansa.

286
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,842
It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce,
nothing more.

287
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,326
Lord Baelish is my uncle now, by marriage.

288
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,609
He's always been so kind to me.

289
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,729
I was so happy to be here, to be free.

290
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,887
All because of him.

291
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,007
But my aunt turned on me.

292
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,129
She cursed me. Called me a whore.

293
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,409
Promised to throw me
through the Moon Door.

294
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,565
When Lord Baelish tried to calm her,
she struck him.

295
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,846
She said she didn't want to live any more.

296
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,002
She stood on the edge of that Moon Door.

297
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,923
He tried to reason with her,

298
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,447
promised her
she was the only one he had ever loved,

299
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,047
but she stepped through those doors
and she was...

300
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,331
It's not your fault, sweet girl.

301
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,248
It's not your fault.

302
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,680
You could see it in the way
she raised that boy.

303
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,684
Feeding him from her own teats
when he was 10 years old.

304
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,764
Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.

305
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,808
Apologies, my lady.

306
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,168
And to you as well, Baelish.
We treated you a bit harshly.

307
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,040
You want justice, Lord Royce.
I can hardly complain about that.

308
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,326
I want the same.

309
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,048
Not much justice to be
meted out in suicide, is there?

310
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,407
For Lysa, no.
But for her son?

311
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,642
Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale

312
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,162
rode behind Jon Arryn,
Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon.

313
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,687
They fought together
to overcome the Mad King.

314
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,003
And since then, Arryn and Royce,
Corbray, Waynwood,

315
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,209
all the great houses of the Vale
watched from the corner.

316
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,726
A timid boy at a tavern brawl.

317
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,406
Are you questioning our courage?

318
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,006
I want to know which side you're on.

319
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,970
Do you support the Lannisters, the house
that executed your friend Ned Stark?

320
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,725
Of course we don't support
the damn Lannisters.

321
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,929
No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister
for support, and Lysa refused.

322
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,125
By staying out of the fray,

323
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,250
you've allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy
his rivals on every compass point.

324
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,765
Who stands against him now?

325
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,406
Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish?

326
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,244
Robb Stark is dead.

327
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,846
I'd have you back Robin Arryn,

328
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,285
Lord of the Vale.

329
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,647
Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.

330
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,008
And sickly little boys
sometimes become powerful men.

331
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,048
More often they die young.

332
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,726
I adored Lysa with all my heart,

333
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,885
but she loved her son so much
she became overprotective.

334
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,601
He needs to learn how to swing a sword,
how to ride a horse.

335
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,127
- Aye, it's time.
- Yes.

336
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,285
Time for him to tour the Vale,
to visit all the castles in his domain.

337
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,648
Time for Robin to leave the nest.

338
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,844
Ser Barristan.

339
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,691
Yes?

340
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,011
Who sent you?

341
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,048
- Ser Barristan.
- Ser Jorah.

342
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,884
Have I forgotten a council meeting?

343
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,531
No.

344
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,690
What's this?

345
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,923
A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon.

346
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,604
You spied on her.

347
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,241
Who gave you this?

348
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,371
Does it matter?

349
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:08,482
- Have you told her?
- I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man,

350
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,688
rather than go behind your back.

351
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,610
Let me speak with her in private.

352
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,887
You'll never be alone with her again.

353
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,001
Why did the usurper pardon you?

354
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,690
If we could speak alone.

355
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,883
No, speak to me here.

356
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,803
Explain it to me.

357
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,009
Who do you think sent this to Meereen?
Who profits?

358
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,161
This is the work of Tywin Lannister.

359
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,129
He wants to divide us.

360
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,646
If we're fighting each other,
we're not fighting him.

361
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,610
The pardon was signed the year we met.

362
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,720
Why were you pardoned?

363
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,087
Unless you're saying
this document was forged.

364
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,600
It is not forged.

365
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,609
Why, then?

366
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,409
I sent letters to Varys,

367
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,370
the spymaster of King's Landing.

368
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,090
What was the content of these letters?

369
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,569
- Information.
- What information?

370
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,244
When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos.

371
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,084
His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo.

372
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,283
When you were married.

373
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,203
When your brother died.

374
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,642
You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?

375
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,486
- I...
- Yes or no?

376
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,641
- Khaleesi.
- Don't call me that.

377
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,803
Did you tell him I was
carrying Drogo's child?

378
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,967
Yes.

379
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,521
That wine merchant tried to poison me
because of your information.

380
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,329
I stopped you from drinking his wine.

381
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,448
Because you knew it was poisoned.

382
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,646
I suspected.

383
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,404
You betrayed me

384
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,322
from the first.

385
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,243
Forgive me.

386
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,600
I never meant...

387
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,445
Please, Khaleesi, forgive me.

388
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,603
You sold my secrets to
the man who killed my father

389
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,762
- and stole my brother's throne...
- I have protected you,

390
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,366
- fought for you, killed for you.
- ...and you want me to forgive you?

391
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,525
I have loved you.

392
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,250
Love?

393
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,561
Love? How can you say that to me?

394
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,531
Any other man,
and I would have you executed.

395
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,683
But you,
I do not want you in my city dead or alive.

396
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,888
Go back to your masters in King's Landing.
Collect your pardon, if you can.

397
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,241
Daenerys, please.

398
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,201
Don't ever presume to touch me again
or speak my name.

399
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,124
You have until dusk to collect your things
and leave this city.

400
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,603
If you're found in Meereen
past break of day,

401
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,126
I'll have your head
thrown into Slaver's Bay.

402
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,764
Go.

403
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,804
Now.

404
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,050
Moat Cailin is yours, Father.

405
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,803
Walk with me.

406
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,281
Has there been any word from Locke?

407
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,805
No.

408
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,726
Unimportant. A cripple, a young boy.

409
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,726
None of the northern lords have seen them.

410
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,488
Dead most likely.

411
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,409
Most of the ironborn have fled the North.

412
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,280
Now more will follow, thanks to you.

413
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,563
Tell me what you see.

414
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:04,485
Moors, fields, hills.

415
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,246
Tell me what you see.

416
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,924
Nothing.

417
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,924
Not nothing. The North.

418
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,922
Ride 700 miles that way,
you're still in the North.

419
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,483
400 miles that way.

420
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,730
300 miles that way.

421
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,641
The North is larger than
the other six kingdoms combined.

422
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,041
And I am the Warden of the North.

423
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,361
The North is mine.

424
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,282
Now tell me, what is your name?

425
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,089
Ramsay Snow.

426
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,448
No, not Ramsay Snow.

427
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,125
Open it.

428
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,487
From this day until your last day,

429
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,528
you are Ramsay Bolton,

430
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,490
son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North.

431
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,490
You honour me.

432
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,688
I swear I will uphold your name
and your tradition.

433
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,010
I will be worthy of you, Father,

434
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,844
I promise.

435
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,603
Come, Reek, I'll be needing a bath.

436
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,566
Yes?

437
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,006
First time I saw you,
you were just a child.

438
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,084
A girl from the North
come to the capital for the first time.

439
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,768
You're not a child any longer.

440
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,087
Why did you help me?

441
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,449
They would have thrown you through
the Moon Door if they found you guilty.

442
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,887
That's not an answer.

443
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,250
If they'd have executed you,
what would they have done with me?

444
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,728
I don't know.

445
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,729
Neither do I.

446
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,048
Better to gamble on the man you know
than the strangers you don't?

447
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,971
And you think you know me?

448
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,368
- I know what you want.
- Do you?

449
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,008
I thought it'd make me happy,

450
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,122
but it doesn't. Not really.

451
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,884
Nothing makes you happy.

452
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,684
- Lots of things make me happy.
- Like what?

453
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,410
Killing Polliver, killing Rorge.

454
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:37,087
So you're sad because
you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself,

455
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,207
is that it?

456
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,009
At least I could have
been there to watch.

457
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,731
I wanted to see the look in his eyes
when he knew it was over.

458
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,168
Aye, nothing in the world beats that look.

459
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,966
You protected him for most of his life.
You think you could have saved him?

460
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,884
I wasn't the damn wine-taster.

461
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,367
Little shit deserved to die, but poison...

462
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,169
Poison's a woman's weapon.

463
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,130
Men kill with steel.

464
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,404
That's your stupid pride talking.
It's why you'll never be a great killer.

465
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,370
I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone
if I had to.

466
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,763
I'd pay good money to see that.

467
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,809
You should have let me burn it.

468
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,443
It's a fleabite.

469
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,569
That fleabite's got you walking
a lot slower than you used to.

470
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,002
Well, we won't have to walk
too much further.

471
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,684
You really think my aunt will pay for me?

472
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,250
Aye.

473
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,084
I've never even met her.

474
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,369
Doesn't matter. You're her blood.

475
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,040
Family, honour, all that horseshit.

476
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,206
It's all you lords and
ladies ever talk about.

477
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,490
I'm not a lady.

478
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,204
Who would pass the Bloody Gate?

479
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,084
The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane.

480
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,964
And his

481
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,521
travelling companion, Arya Stark,

482
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,690
niece of your lady Lysa Arryn.

483
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,482
Then I offer my condolences.

484
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,441
Lady Arryn died.

485
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,203
Three days ago.

486
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,483
I've never left home before,
Uncle Petyr. I'm afraid to leave.

487
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,800
You shouldn't be.

488
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,089
The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie,
Mother said.

489
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,162
It's not safe outside.

490
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,685
It wasn't safe for her inside.

491
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,730
People die at their dinner tables.

492
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,564
They die in their beds.

493
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,162
They die squatting over their chamber pots.

494
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,402
Everybody dies sooner or later.

495
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,602
Don't worry about your death.

496
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,801
Worry about your life.

497
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,930
Take charge of your life
for as long as it lasts.

498
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,409
That is what it means
to be Lord of the Vale.

499
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,129
Shall we go?

500
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,001
Wine always helps.

501
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,608
I thank you for it.

502
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,528
Trial by combat.

503
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,922
Deciding a man's guilt or innocence

504
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,809
in the eyes of the gods

505
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,168
by having two other men
hack each other to pieces.

506
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,811
Tells you something about the gods.

507
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,410
How much longer?

508
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,005
Soon.

509
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,730
Do you think Oberyn has a chance?

510
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,806
The Red Viper of Dorne.

511
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,121
You don't get a name like that
unless you're deadly, right?

512
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,611
I've never seen him fight.

513
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,411
Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die.

514
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,927
- Oberyn believes in himself.
- That's putting it mildly.

515
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,002
What's the punishment for regicide?

516
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,970
Drawing and quartering? Hanging?

517
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,441
- Breaking at the wheel?
- Beheading.

518
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,124
Seems rather ordinary.

519
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,441
And he was my nephew as well,
so what is that?

520
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,320
Fratricide is brothers
and filicide is sons.

521
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,047
Nepoticide. That's the one.

522
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,724
Matricide, patricide,

523
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,565
infanticide, suicide.

524
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,091
There's no kind of killing
that doesn't have its own word.

525
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,809
- Cousins.
- You're right.

526
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,121
There is no word for cousin-killing.

527
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,964
Well done.

528
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,327
Do you remember Cousin Orson?
Orson Lannister?

529
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,847
Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him
on his head and left him simple.

530
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,524
Simple?

531
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,047
Used to sit all day in the garden
crushing beetles with a rock.

532
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,847
- Nothing made him happier.
- Nothing made you happier.

533
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,445
You'd think being tormented from birth

534
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,761
would have given you
some affinity for the afflicted.

535
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,285
On the contrary.

536
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,964
Laughing at another person's misery

537
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,883
was the only thing that
made me feel like everyone else.

538
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,166
- The joke wore thin, though.
- For you. You drifted away.

539
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,401
I had other interests.

540
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,489
Yes, other interests.

541
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,771
- But I stayed with Orson.
- Why?

542
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,050
I was curious.

543
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,451
Why was he smashing all those beetles?
What did he get out of it?

544
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,163
First thing I did was ask him.

545
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,324
"Orson, why are you smashing
all those beetles?"

546
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,524
He gave me an answer.

547
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,444
"Smash the beetles. Smash 'em."

548
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,844
I wasn't deterred.

549
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,410
I was the smartest person I knew.

550
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,801
Certainly I had the wherewithal
to unravel the mysteries

551
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,087
that lay at the heart of a moron.

552
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,171
So I went to Maester Volarik's library.

553
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,242
Volarik. Tried to touch me once.

554
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,800
Turns out, far too much
has been written about great men

555
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,201
and not nearly enough about morons.

556
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,648
Doesn't seem right.

557
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,566
In any case, I found nothing that illuminated
the nature of Orson's affliction

558
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,450
or the reason behind
his relentless beetle slaughter.

559
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,002
So I went back to the source.

560
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,923
I may not have been able
to speak with Orson,

561
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,731
but I could observe him, watch him

562
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,882
the way men watch animals

563
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,765
to come to a deeper understanding
of their behaviour.

564
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,404
And as I watched,

565
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,051
I became more and more sure of it.

566
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,361
There was something happening there.

567
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,405
His face was like the page of a book

568
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,482
written in a language I didn't understand.

569
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,331
But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons.

570
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,684
And I became possessed
with knowing what they were.

571
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,445
I began to spend
inordinate amounts of time watching him.

572
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,441
I would eat my lunch in the garden,

573
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,204
chewing my mutton to the music of...

574
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,244
And when I wasn't watching him,
I was thinking about him.

575
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,368
Father droned on about the family legacy,

576
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,329
and I thought about Orson's beetles.

577
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,131
I read the histories of
Targaryen conquests.

578
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,123
Did I hear dragon wings? No.

579
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,281
I heard...

580
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,802
And I still couldn't figure out
why he was doing it.

581
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,362
And I had to know, because it was horrible

582
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,727
that all these beetles should be
dying for no reason.

583
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,290
Every day around the world,

584
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:51,081
men, women, and children
are murdered by the score.

585
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,640
Who gives a dusty fuck about
a bunch of beetles?

586
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,202
I know. But still it filled me with dread.

587
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,971
Piles and piles of them,
years and years of them.

588
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,883
How many countless living, crawling things

589
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,884
smashed and dried out
and returned to the dirt?

590
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,808
In my dreams I found myself

591
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,882
standing on a beach made of beetle husks

592
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,401
stretching as far as the eye could see.

593
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:17,088
I woke up crying,
weeping for their shattered little bodies.

594
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,889
I tried to stop Orson once.

595
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,121
He was twice your size.

596
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:24,569
He just pushed me aside with a "cuhn"
and kept on smashing.

597
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,125
Every day,

598
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,090
until that mule kicked him in the chest
and killed him.

599
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,009
So what do you think?

600
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,608
Why did he do it?

601
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,769
What was it all about?

602
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,964
I don't know.

603
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,723
Good luck today.

604
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,329
Looks like very light armour.

605
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,481
I like to move around.

606
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,250
You could at least wear a helmet.

607
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,129
You shouldn't drink before a fight.

608
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,328
You learned this during
your years in the fighting pits?

609
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,604
I always drink before a fight.

610
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,365
It could get you killed.
It could get me killed.

611
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,163
Today is not the day I die.

612
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,002
You're going to fight that?

613
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,605
I'm going to kill that.

614
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,565
He is the biggest man
I've ever seen.

615
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,610
Size does not matter
when you are flat on your back.

616
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,245
Thank the gods.

617
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,603
In the sight of gods and men,

618
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:38,051
we gather to ascertain
the guilt or innocence of this...

619
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:42,050
...man, Tyrion Lannister.

620
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,168
May the Mother grant them mercy.

621
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,645
May the Father give them
such justice as they deserve.

622
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,963
And may the Warrior guide the hand
of our champion...

623
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,408
Don't leave me alone in this world.

624
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,244
Never.

625
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,764
Have they told you who I am?

626
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,921
Some dead man.

627
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,806
I am the brother of Elia Martell.

628
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:42,286
And do you know why I have come all the
way to this stinking shit-pile of a city?

629
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,566
For you.

630
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,530
I'm going to hear you
confess before you die.

631
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:56,049
You raped my sister. You murdered her.

632
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,804
You killed her children.

633
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,886
Say it now, and we can make this quick.

634
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,485
Say it. You raped her.

635
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,686
You murdered her.

636
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,441
You killed her children.

637
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:35,091
You raped her! You murdered her!
You killed her children!

638
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,643
You raped her!

639
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,051
You murdered her!

640
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,802
You killed her children!

641
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,881
Wait. Are you dying?

642
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,885
No. You can't die yet.
You haven't confessed.

643
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,771
Say it.

644
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,007
Say her name. Elia Martell.

645
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,606
You raped her. You killed her children.

646
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,927
Elia Martell.

647
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,644
Who gave you the order?

648
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,323
Who gave you the order?

649
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,127
Say her name!

650
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,846
You raped her! You murdered her!

651
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,048
You killed her children!

652
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,443
Say her name.

653
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,050
Say it!

654
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,601
Elia Martell.

655
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,124
I killed her children,

656
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,006
then I raped her.

657
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,125
Then I smashed her head in like this!

658
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,969
The gods have made their will known.

659
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,487
Tyrion Lannister,

660
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,131
in the name of King Tommen
of the House Baratheon,

661
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,362
First of His Name,

662
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,204
you are hereby sentenced to death.

1
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,888
What was she like?

2
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,927
She had red hair.

3
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,921
Oh?

4
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,483
- How big were her feet?
- What do you want me to say?

5
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,246
I want you to tell me
what it was like to have someone.

6
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,126
To be with someone.

7
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,611
To love someone
and have them love you back.

8
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,482
We're all gonna die
a lot sooner than I'd planned.

9
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,091
You're the closest I'll
ever get to knowing.

10
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,005
So you and Gilly never?

11
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,566
No. She just had a baby.

12
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,805
And she never offered.

13
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,243
But if she had,

14
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,283
you would have?

15
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,126
You'd have broken your vows?

16
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,686
The interesting thing is,

17
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,322
our vows never specifically forbid
intimate relations with women.

18
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,646
What?

19
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,009
"I shall take no wife." Yes, that's
in there. There's no denying that.

20
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,686
"I shall father no children."
It's very specific.

21
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,450
But what our vows have to say
about other activities

22
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,727
is open to interpretation.

23
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,361
I don't think Ser Alliser
cares much for interpretation.

24
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,882
Anyway, there's nothing
for him to interpret.

25
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,485
We didn't.

26
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,043
So what's it like?

27
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,241
It's...

28
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,089
There's this whole other person.

29
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,845
And you're wrapped up in them,
and they're wrapped up in you.

30
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,085
And you...

31
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,803
For a little while,
you're more than just you. You're...

32
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,848
Well, I don't know. I'm
not a bleeding poet.

33
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,490
No, you're really not.

34
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,884
What did I get for it?

35
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,401
An arrow six inches from my heart.

36
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,686
There'll be arrows for all of us soon.

37
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,410
There will.

38
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,848
They've already done the worst thing to me
they could ever do.

39
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,643
Go get some sleep, Sam.

40
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,690
I'll take this watch.

41
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,246
Did I ever tell you about her?

42
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,647
Sheila?

43
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,601
Yes.

44
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,010
That was a night to remember.

45
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,486
Of course, I'd had a good bit to drink.

46
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,966
Her fangs were sharp,
but she knew how to use them.

47
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,926
And she was nice and soft down below.

48
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,327
No, she was no ordinary beast.

49
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,450
Many is the man who...

50
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,522
I know you never fucked a bear.

51
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,042
You know you never fucked a bear.

52
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,922
Right now, I don't want to think about
the bear you never fucked.

53
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,731
Right now, all I want to think about is

54
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,280
each one of these arrows
finding its way into a crow's heart.

55
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,963
We could be waiting here a while.

56
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,371
Good.

57
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,289
The longer we wait, the
more arrows I'll have.

58
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,369
They came up here to our land

59
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,886
and put up a big wall
and said it was theirs.

60
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,201
Then they started hunting us down.

61
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,209
But this time,
we're the ones doing the hunting.

62
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,924
You've got a lot to say about killing.

63
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,843
Even more words than arrows.

64
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,001
Back in those villages,
I killed just as many of them as you did.

65
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,491
More, I reckon.

66
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,680
Yes, but none of those
were your crow lover.

67
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,524
I probably killed him already.

68
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,920
So you've said.

69
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,570
And if not,

70
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,962
the only thing left of him is gonna be
his fun bits hanging around me neck.

71
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,769
More words.

72
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,088
Know what I think you do when you see him?

73
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,923
Serve him up
a nice juicy slice of ginger minge.

74
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,168
What, you've been thinking about
that ginger minge?

75
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,368
Wondering what it tastes like?

76
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,569
Maybe I have.

77
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,483
Jon Snow is mine.

78
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,881
Anyone else tries to kill him,

79
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,281
I'll have an arrow for them.

80
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,921
And not one of your bald friends
is fast enough to stop me.

81
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,849
And what is it that couldn't wait
until morning, Tarly?

82
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,285
Maester Aemon.

83
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,767
- How did you know...
- That it was you?

84
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,161
Who else but Samwell Tarly

85
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,926
would be wasting candles
to read in the middle of the night?

86
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,201
- Let me help you.
- Oh, no need.

87
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,888
I know my way around this library better
than any other place in Castle Black.

88
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,889
Thousands of books
and no eyes to read them.

89
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,090
Old age is a wonderful source of ironies,

90
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,969
if nothing else.

91
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,647
But you didn't answer my question.

92
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,001
What are you reading?

93
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,445
Maester Faull.

94
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,931
Ah.

95
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,684
The wildlings.

96
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,401
I can assure you that the
closest Maester Faull

97
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,643
ever got to a wildling
was this very library.

98
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,564
But what he says about what they do,

99
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,127
it's all true.

100
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,965
It's exactly what
the survivors of their raids report.

101
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,443
Yes, imagine the stories
wildlings tell about us.

102
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,409
Love is the death of duty.

103
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,726
I told that to your friend Jon Snow once.

104
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,046
He didn't listen, and neither did you.

105
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,451
Which is why you've abandoned
your watch atop the Wall

106
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,127
to come here and read
about the terrible things

107
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,091
that may have happened
to the girl you love.

108
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,251
I don't love her.

109
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,084
- Yes, you do.
- No.

110
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,321
Yes, you do.

111
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,767
Heard it in your voice
when you first brought her to me.

112
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,606
I remember how it sounds.

113
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,364
I was in love once.

114
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,641
You were?

115
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,841
You can imagine all manner of horrors
befalling that poor girl and her child.

116
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,446
Is it so difficult to imagine that

117
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,605
an old person was once,
more or less, like you?

118
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,650
I'm sorry, Maester.

119
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,041
I didn't mean it like that.

120
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,603
Do you know who I was before I came here?

121
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,888
What I could have been
if I'd only said the word?

122
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,449
Of course you do.

123
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,122
I met many girls
when I was Aemon Targaryen.

124
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,965
A future king always does.

125
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,240
Some of them were quite forward
in their attempts to win my affections.

126
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,247
One of them succeeded.

127
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,730
I was very young.

128
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,401
Who was she?

129
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,081
Ah.

130
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,649
I could tell you everything about her.

131
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,929
Who she was, how we met,

132
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,801
the colour of her eyes
and the shape of her nose.

133
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,609
I can see her

134
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,927
right in front of me.

135
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,728
She's more real than you are.

136
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,569
We could spend all night
trading tales of lost loves.

137
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,405
Nothing makes the past
a sweeter place to visit

138
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,525
than the prospect of imminent death.

139
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,170
Go to bed, Tarly.

140
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,371
I'm sorry, I can't open the gate
for nobody. Orders.

141
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,091
You don't understand.
They killed everyone.

142
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,810
Everyone but my baby.

143
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,247
And they're out there.
I saw them on my way here.

144
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,561
They may have seen me.
They may have followed me. Please.

145
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,721
I'm sorry, I can't.

146
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,041
If they find us out here,
you don't know what they'll do.

147
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,246
Pyp! Open the gate.

148
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,846
- I can't.
- Sam, is that you?

149
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,081
Yes.

150
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,128
Thorne gave me strict orders
to not open the gate.

151
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,642
Oh, Pyp, open the fucking gate!

152
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,920
I never heard you curse before.

153
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,809
Yes, well, best get used to it.

154
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,764
Are you all right?

155
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,365
You're all right, yeah.

156
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,405
Of course you are, my brave little fella.

157
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,165
- It was horrible.
- I'm so sorry.

158
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,920
I didn't know until I got back.

159
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,525
Don't let them send me away, Sam.

160
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,484
- Never.
- I know there's no women allowed.

161
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,849
Anyone who tries to throw you out
will be having words with me.

162
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,406
From now on, wherever you go, I go, too.

163
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,164
Get ready!

164
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,847
- Man the gate!
- Ready yourselves!

165
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,122
- Make haste! Prepare!
- Up on the Wall!

166
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,850
Quickly! Up!

167
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,730
How many are there?

168
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,531
Beyond the trees!

169
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,730
It's time.

170
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,964
- Light them up!
- Light them all!

171
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,445
Move!

172
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,760
Pick up the pace!

173
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,689
Come on!

174
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,046
Here we go, boys. There's one.

175
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,241
There's two.

176
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,524
Come on, let's get the next load.

177
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,127
That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser.

178
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,885
100,000 you say?

179
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,445
Yes, ser.

180
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,603
You can say it if you like.

181
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,405
We should have sealed the tunnel
while we had the chance,

182
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,847
like you suggested.

183
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,931
It was a difficult
decision either way, ser.

184
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,322
Do you know what leadership means,
Lord Snow?

185
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,085
It means that the person in charge
gets second-guessed by

186
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,640
every clever little twat with a mouth.

187
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,082
But if he starts second-guessing himself,

188
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,049
that's the end

189
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,886
for him, for the clever little twats,

190
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,121
for everyone.

191
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,122
This is not the end. Not for us.

192
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:33,081
Not if you lot do your duty for
however long it takes to beat them back.

193
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,684
And then you get to go on hating me,

194
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,526
and I get to go on wishing
your wildling whore had finished the job.

195
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,570
You'll be safe down here.

196
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,485
I'll check on you as soon as I can.

197
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,245
You're leaving me again?

198
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,200
I'm not leaving you.

199
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,927
You're going up there and we're
staying down here. That's leaving.

200
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,562
You said from now on we'd stay together.

201
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,403
I didn't mean in the same room.

202
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,641
What are you going to do out there?

203
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,960
- Help my brothers.
- How?

204
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,491
You're going to fight the free folk
when they come? They'll kill you.

205
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,843
In Mole's Town, they killed everyone.

206
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,328
I can't just hide here with you
while they're fighting out there.

207
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,526
Why not?

208
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,725
You won't matter up there.
You will down here.

209
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,170
I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly.

210
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,845
I made a promise to defend the Wall,
and I have to keep it,

211
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,287
because that's what men do.

212
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,126
Promise me you won't die.

213
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,367
I promise you I won't die.

214
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,170
There's a lot more wildlings on the
other side of the Wall than this side.

215
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,247
We've got loads of weapons and things.

216
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,368
It's the perfect place for us to be.

217
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,761
I've never thrown a spear before.

218
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,446
I've never held a sword with a proper edge.

219
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,847
This is no place for me to be.

220
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,526
You're not afraid?

221
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,442
Of course I'm afraid.

222
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,965
There's a band of wildlings
coming to kill us.

223
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,011
If you're afraid of a band of wildlings,

224
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,084
how in seven hells
did you manage to kill a White Walker?

225
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,730
I didn't know I was going to kill it.

226
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,203
But I had to do something.
I didn't have any choice.

227
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,089
It was going to kill
Gilly and take the baby.

228
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,367
If someone had asked me my name right then,
I wouldn't have known.

229
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,563
I wasn't Samwell Tarly any more.

230
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:45,641
I wasn't a steward in the Night's Watch,
or son of Randyll Tarly, or any of that.

231
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,604
I was nothing at all.

232
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,762
And when you're nothing at all,

233
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,647
there's no more reason to be afraid.

234
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,970
But you're afraid now?

235
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,645
Yes, well,

236
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,564
I'm not nothing any more.

237
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,406
Most of their men are up top.

238
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,850
Didn't count more than
20 down here. Leftovers.

239
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,968
They got a big fat one
and a little bony one manning the front.

240
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,087
How high are the walls?

241
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,447
Well, we'll be up and over
before they know what's happened.

242
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,284
Let's kill some crows!

243
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,201
Come on!

244
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,483
Come on, brothers!

245
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,291
Archers, nock.

246
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,526
Everyone else, hold.

247
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,245
Grenn, no!

248
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,965
I said nock and hold, you cunts!

249
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,966
- Does nock mean draw?
- No, ser!

250
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,283
- Does fucking hold mean fucking drop?
- No, ser!

251
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,563
- You all plan to die here tonight?
- No, ser!

252
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,007
That's very good to hear. Draw!

253
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,244
No, down below!

254
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,288
Draw! Light them up.

255
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,686
Come on, get up!

256
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,524
They're attacking the southern gate!

257
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,410
- Now?
- Now.

258
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,846
I'm going down there.

259
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,321
- Brother Slynt, you have the Wall.
- What?

260
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,530
What are you fucking waiting for? Loose!

261
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,761
You heard the man. Loose!

262
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,560
You, over there.

263
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,687
- Did you get one?
- No.

264
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,490
- Shit, Pyp!
- Shit.

265
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,971
- Sam.
- Yeah?

266
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,087
I think we're gonna die.

267
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,163
If you keep missing, we will.

268
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,763
Come on!

269
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,681
Brothers!

270
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,885
A hundred generations
have defended this castle.

271
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,681
She's never fallen before.

272
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,285
She will not fall tonight.

273
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,369
Those are Thenns at our walls.

274
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,848
They eat the flesh of the men they kill.

275
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,001
Do you want to fill the belly
of a Thenn tonight?

276
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,286
No!

277
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,885
Tonight we fight.

278
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,201
And when the sun rises, I promise you,

279
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,124
Castle Black will stand!

280
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,448
The Night's Watch will stand!

281
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,561
Yes!

282
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,490
With me now! Now with me!

283
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,529
No discipline. No training.

284
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,967
Gang of thieves, that's all this is.

285
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,681
I commanded the City Watch
of King's Landing.

286
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,603
Those men obeyed orders.

287
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,410
We can't just let them attack the gate.

288
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,848
The bars of those gates are
four inches of cold-rolled steel.

289
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,366
Those are giants
riding mammoths down there!

290
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,807
Do you think your cold-rolled steel
is gonna stop them?

291
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,126
No such thing as giants.

292
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,809
A story for the children.

293
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,763
Brother Slynt.

294
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,207
We just got word
that Ser Alliser needs you below.

295
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,849
You're the most experienced man
he's got, ser, and he needs you.

296
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,249
Needed below?

297
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,163
Yes.

298
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,042
Archers, nock your arrows!

299
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,009
Nock arrows!

300
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,686
Draw!

301
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,764
Loose!

302
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,043
They won't summit before dawn.

303
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,241
How do you know that?

304
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,288
Because I've made that climb.

305
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,931
I think they're in a bigger
hurry than you were.

306
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,929
Hold the bridge!

307
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,202
Hold, wait for it!

308
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,249
Come on with the rocks!

309
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,884
Nock!

310
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,241
Draw!

311
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,770
Loose!

312
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,284
Down!

313
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,761
No!

314
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,566
To the gate. Come on, let's move.

315
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,130
Come on, up there!

316
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,760
It's gonna open.

317
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,725
- I got one right through the heart. He's dead.
- Oh.

318
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,604
- Is it over?
- No.

319
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,290
Well, then...

320
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,051
You're all right.

321
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,449
I'll get help.

322
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,690
Maester Aemon is coming.

323
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,651
He's gonna make it all right.

324
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,522
- Now.
- Now!

325
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,570
The outer gate won't hold.

326
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,844
- Take five men, hold the inner gate.
- Aye.

327
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,490
Hold the gate.

328
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,410
If they make it through...

329
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,570
They won't.

330
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,640
Come on, Hill. And you, Cooper.

331
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,731
You three, on me!

332
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,167
Come on, you lazy bastards!

333
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,770
Oil.

334
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,970
Oil on the ramp!

335
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,562
Protect the gate!

336
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,127
Get him inside.

337
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,522
Hold that fucking gate!

338
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,204
Hold it!

339
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,731
We need more men down here.

340
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,326
- We have to hold the gate.
- But we need men here.

341
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,482
Tell Jon. He's in command.

342
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,841
Let's go.

343
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,089
Get me to the top! You hear me?

344
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,241
Your name's Olly, right?

345
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,529
Listen to me, Olly. Get me to the top.

346
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,807
And when we give the signal,
bring us back down.

347
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,606
You hear me?

348
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,171
Find a weapon, Olly. Fight them.

349
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,962
Clear the way! Let's go!

350
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,883
- Out of the way!
- Get out of here!

351
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,091
Cut the rope!

352
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,764
Wait! No!

353
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,087
- We need more archers.
- Here I am.

354
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,924
- Come on.
- Come on. Quickly.

355
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,887
What are you doing up here?

356
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,042
The wildlings are over the walls.

357
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,610
Ser Alliser's fallen.

358
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,606
The castle won't stand much longer.

359
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,805
Edd, you have the Wall.

360
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,966
If they try the mammoths again,
drop fire on them.

361
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,327
If the climbers get too high,
drop the scythe on them.

362
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,489
Come, brothers. Now fight with me!

363
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,962
Might as well enjoy
our last night, right, boys?

364
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,122
Light the fuckers up!

365
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,206
Nock! Draw!

366
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,123
Loose!

367
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,760
- How are we gonna stop that?
- Shot 20 arrows in him already.

368
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,001
You heard Jon. We hold the gate.

369
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,289
- Jon Snow's not Lord Commander.
- We hold the gate!

370
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,447
Mother, save me. Father, save me.

371
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,285
The gods aren't down here.
It's the six of us. You hear me?

372
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,285
- Please.
- Night gathers and now my watch begins.

373
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,601
It shall not end until my death.

374
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,081
I shall take no wife, hold no lands,

375
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,491
father no children.

376
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,245
- I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.
- Win no glory.

377
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,561
I shall live and die by my post.

378
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,449
I am the sword in the darkness.

379
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,249
I am the watcher on the walls.

380
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,290
I am the shield that
guards the realms of men.

381
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,251
I pledge my life and honour
to the Night's Watch

382
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,130
for this night and all the nights to come!

383
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,331
I don't want you out there.

384
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,489
You can't protect me forever.

385
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,040
There won't be anywhere to hide
if the castle falls.

386
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,244
I need him more than I need you.

387
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,246
We need you, boy.

388
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,966
Ha!

389
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,966
Jon Snow.

390
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,046
Hush. Don't talk.

391
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,642
Do you remember that cave?

392
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,206
We should have stayed in that cave.

393
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,845
We'll go back there.

394
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,648
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

395
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,002
Drop the scythe, boys!

396
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,040
- Hoist her up.
- Hoist her up!

397
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,122
They've had enough for one night.

398
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,447
Don't cheer too loud.

399
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,844
They still outnumber us 1,000 to one.

400
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,650
Tormund.

401
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,411
It's over.

402
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,761
Let it end.

403
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,925
This is how a man ends.

404
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,447
Put him in chains.

405
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,483
We'll question him later.

406
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,881
I should have thrown you

407
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,009
from the top of the Wall, boy!

408
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,491
Aye.

409
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,443
You should have.

410
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,409
Whoa, it's me.

411
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,086
I promised you, didn't I?

412
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,488
We held them off.

413
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,164
For one night.

414
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,601
This is a great victory.

415
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,728
A great victory?

416
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,411
Mance was testing our defences.
He almost made it through.

417
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,211
And he has more giants.
He has more mammoths.

418
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,886
He has 1,000 times as many men.

419
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,045
They'll hit us again tonight.

420
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:47,886
Maybe we can hold them off for a day
or two, but we'll never beat them.

421
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,405
Where are we going?

422
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,244
Going to find Mance.

423
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,846
You can't do that.

424
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,764
No one gave you any orders.

425
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,765
Who's left to give orders?

426
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,611
The wildling army's only an army
because of Mance.

427
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,761
He united 100 warring tribes.

428
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,410
Without Mance, they lose their leader.

429
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,321
They lose their purpose.
They go back to fighting each other.

430
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,890
Scatter back to their homes.

431
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,528
Without Mance?

432
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,601
You're going to kill him?

433
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,841
I'm gonna try.

434
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:20,122
They'll never let you
within 100 yards of him.

435
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,248
And even if they did,
even if you managed to kill him...

436
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,687
They'll kill me?
If I don't go, they'll kill me anyway.

437
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,325
They'll kill the rest of us, too.

438
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,050
They won't just kill you.

439
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,043
They'll boil you, flay
you, make it last days.

440
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:38,323
You're right. It's a bad plan.

441
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,609
What's your plan?

442
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,288
They held the gate.

443
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,961
Get some brothers down here to help you.

444
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,089
We need to burn the bodies.

445
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,483
Raise the outer gate.

446
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,606
Then lower it again as soon as I'm out.

447
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,526
What are you doing?

448
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,171
I promised Mormont I'd never lose it again.

449
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,722
In case I don't come back.

450
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,365
Jon.

451
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,886
Come back.
1
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,446
You're wearing a black cloak again.

2
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,201
I've been sent to negotiate with you.

3
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,800
It appears my trusting nature
got the better of me.

4
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,204
It's happened before.

5
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,887
I was hoping your loyalty was real
when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow.

6
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,724
Truly, I was.

7
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,564
The Half hand ordered me to join your army

8
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,365
and bring back whatever information
I could to Castle Black.

9
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,920
He made me kill him so you'd trust me.

10
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,604
I was loyal

11
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,126
to him and to my Night's Watch vows.

12
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,005
All your vows?

13
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,002
She wasn't enough to turn you, eh?

14
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,049
Were you enough to turn her?

15
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,800
She put three arrows in me when I escaped.

16
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,530
Did you see her again at Castle Black?

17
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,087
Yes.

18
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,726
And?

19
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,881
She's dead.

20
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,201
Your doing?

21
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,170
No.

22
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,811
We'll drink to her.

23
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,690
Of all the ways I'd kill you,
poison would be the last.

24
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,401
- Ygritte.
- Ygritte.

25
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,966
That's not wine.

26
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,010
No, it's a proper northern drink, Jon Snow.

27
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,331
You did well. Fought hard.

28
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,166
Killed some of our strongest men.

29
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,802
One of our giants went into your tunnel
and never came out again.

30
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,325
Mag the Mighty.

31
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,370
He's dead.

32
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,604
He killed my friend Grenn.

33
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,011
He was their king.

34
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,920
The last of a bloodline that stretches back
before the First Men.

35
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,443
Grenn came from a farm.

36
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,606
- Mag and Grenn.
- Grenn and Mag.

37
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,126
Kullback, could I trouble you
for something to eat?

38
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,808
I don't imagine our guest has eaten
anything for quite some time.

39
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,121
So, you're here to strike a bargain?

40
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,928
Turn your army around and go home.

41
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,843
You know I know
you're low on arrows,

42
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,327
you're low on oil, you're low on men.

43
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,209
How many are left, 50?

44
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,568
I told Tormund and Orell.

45
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,130
We have more than 1,000 men.

46
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,647
I showed you everything I had.
The whole army, 100,000 strong.

47
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,281
And what did you do?
You fired on us with everything you had.

48
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,441
It wasn't much.

49
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,003
As soon as I saw that,
I sent 400 men to climb the Wall,

50
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,560
an unmanned stretch five
miles west of here.

51
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,284
A lot of them will die climbing,

52
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,488
but most of them will be over
by the end of the day.

53
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,166
It's me being honest with you, Jon Snow,
which is more than you've ever done for me.

54
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,641
My people have bled enough.

55
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,846
We're not here to conquer.

56
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,090
We're here to hide behind your Wall.
Just like you.

57
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,564
We need your tunnel.

58
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,763
Now we both know that winter is coming.

59
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,128
And if my people aren't south of the Wall
when it comes in earnest,

60
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,043
we'll all end up worse than dead.

61
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,722
You want to strike a bargain with me?
Here's the bargain.

62
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,922
You go back, you open the gates to us,

63
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,288
and I swear to you that
no one else will die.

64
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,567
Refuse,

65
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,206
and we'll kill every last
man at Castle Black.

66
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,690
Ah!

67
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,850
Oh...

68
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,490
That's why you're here.

69
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,570
I reckon you could do it
before any of them could stop you.

70
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,404
They'd kill you, of course.

71
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,686
They'd kill you slow.

72
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,481
But you knew that when you came in here.

73
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,761
Are you capable of that, Jon Snow?

74
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,287
Killing a man in his own tent
when he's just offered you peace?

75
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,203
Is that what the Night's Watch is?

76
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,241
Is that what you are?

77
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,445
Riders coming!

78
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,650
- Are you attacking us?
- No.

79
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,246
It's like you said, we don't have the men.

80
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,447
Hold! To me! To me!

81
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,928
Stand down!

82
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,006
I said my people have bled enough,

83
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,089
and I meant it.

84
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,885
Round them up.

85
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,564
Stay with the horses.

86
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,444
You're the King-beyond-the-Wall?

87
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,011
- Do you know who I am?
- Never had the pleasure.

88
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,084
This is Stannis Baratheon,
the one true king of the Seven Kingdoms.

89
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,006
We're not in the Seven Kingdoms,
and you're not dressed for this weather.

90
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,482
It is customary to kneel
when surrendering to a king.

91
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,044
We do not kneel.

92
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,003
I'll have thousands of your men
in chains by nightfall,

93
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,691
have nowhere to put them,
have nothing to feed them.

94
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,851
I'm not here to slaughter beat dogs.

95
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,487
Their fate depends on their king.

96
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,565
All the same, we do not kneel.

97
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,604
Take these men away.

98
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,202
What's a man of the Night's Watch
doing in a wildling camp?

99
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,851
I was sent to discuss terms
with the King-beyond-the-Wall.

100
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,241
You're speaking to the one true king, boy.

101
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,129
You will address him as "Your Grace."

102
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,204
I know he's the king.
My father died for him.

103
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,120
My name is Jon Snow, Your Grace.

104
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,246
I'm Ned Stark's son.

105
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,402
Your father was an honourable man.

106
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,363
He was, Your Grace.

107
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,323
What do you think he'd have done with him?

108
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,371
I was this man's prisoner once.

109
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,523
He could have tortured me.
He could have killed me.

110
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,682
But he spared my life.

111
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,967
I think my father would
have taken him prisoner,

112
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,769
listened to what he had to say.

113
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,847
Very well, then. Take him.

114
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,121
Your Grace.

115
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,886
If my father had seen the
things that I've seen,

116
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,851
he'd also tell you to
burn the dead before nightfall.

117
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,011
All of them.

118
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,527
I would suggest milk of the poppy
to ease his pain,

119
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,405
- but he is completely insensate.
- Bloody Martells.

120
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,722
The cause
appears to be manticore venom.

121
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,849
It is. The Death's Head manticore.

122
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,850
I've read a great deal about it.
It's a horrible poison.

123
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,491
Usually Mantari in origin.

124
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,560
Oh!

125
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,846
There's nothing to be done.

126
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,160
Yes, there is.

127
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,722
May I ask what you think you're doing?

128
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,847
Saving him.

129
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,522
Your Grace, I wish it were
otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond saving.

130
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,128
Well, well beyond.

131
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,603
This man is not even a maester,
let alone grand maester.

132
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,803
That's for the best.
No maester knows how to save him.

133
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,008
That is exactly the sort of arrogance

134
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,924
that had him expelled
from the Citadel, Your Grace.

135
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,289
His curiosity was deemed
dangerous and unnatural.

136
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,084
Rightly so, in my opinion.

137
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,448
You're dismissed, Grand Maester.

138
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,210
But, Your Grace, this is my laboratory.

139
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,965
- Not any more.
- But...

140
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,691
- You can save him?
- Difficult to say, Your Grace.

141
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,127
But if my past work is any guide...

142
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,801
...we stand a chance.

143
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,291
Do everything you can.

144
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,050
Come to me for anything you need.

145
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,724
Thank you, Your Grace.

146
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,565
You should know,

147
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,803
the process may change him

148
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,284
somewhat.

149
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,765
Will it weaken him?

150
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,605
Oh, no.

151
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,764
Very well, then.

152
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,046
Not another word.

153
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,881
We've been over this. The matter's closed.

154
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,485
I'm opening it again.

155
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,242
You were betrothed to Loras Tyrell.

156
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,282
You're still betrothed to Loras Tyrell.

157
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:28,008
And you will marry Loras Tyrell
as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.

158
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,241
I will not.

159
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,286
Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands.

160
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,250
Tyrion's sentence
will be carried out tomorrow.

161
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,963
You have on several occasions
made great claims

162
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,771
about your commitment
to this family's future.

163
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,407
Your role in that future
is more vital now than it ever was.

164
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,369
I don't care.

165
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,848
I will stay in King's Landing where
I belong with my son, the king.

166
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,606
When you were nine years old,
I was called to the capital.

167
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,921
I decided to take your brother with me
and not you.

168
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,207
You insisted that you would not be left
at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.

169
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,964
- If you recall...
- I'm not interested in hearing

170
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,647
another one of your smug stories
about the time you won.

171
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,961
This isn't going to be one of those times.

172
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,644
Do you think you'll be the first person

173
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,769
dragged into a Sept
to be married against her will?

174
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,649
When you marched into the throne room
to tell me

175
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,849
we'd won the Battle of Blackwater,
do you remember?

176
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,131
I was sitting on the
Iron Throne with Tommen.

177
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,165
I was about to give him
essence of nightshade.

178
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,685
That's how far I was willing to go

179
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,724
when I thought someone awful
had come to take my son away.

180
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,242
Someone awful is coming to take him away.

181
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,687
No.

182
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,809
Joffrey is dead.
Myrcella's been sold like livestock.

183
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,009
And now you want to ship me off
to Highgarden and steal my boy.

184
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,923
My last boy.

185
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,610
Margaery will dig her claws in,
you will dig your claws in,

186
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,241
and you'll fight over him like beasts
until you rip him apart.

187
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,370
I will burn our house to the ground
before I let that happen.

188
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,363
And how will you do that?

189
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,850
I'll tell everyone the truth.

190
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,281
What truth would that be?

191
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,166
You don't know, do you?

192
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,041
You never believed it.

193
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,807
How is that possible?

194
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,366
What am I saying? Of course it's possible.

195
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,848
How can someone so consumed
by the idea of his family

196
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,129
have any conception
what his actual family was doing?

197
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,244
We were right there in front of you,
and you didn't see us.

198
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,561
One real look in the past 20 years

199
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,325
at your own children
and you would have known.

200
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,890
Known what?

201
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,365
Everything they say is true

202
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,010
- about Jaime and me.
- No.

203
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,809
- Your legacy is a lie.
- No, no, no, no.

204
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,922
I don't believe you.

205
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,525
Yes, you do.

206
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,441
Jaime.

207
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,005
You won.

208
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,765
One fewer brother. Must
be proud of yourself.

209
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,127
There's really nothing
you wouldn't do, is there?

210
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,043
For my family, no, nothing.

211
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,168
I would do things for my family
you couldn't imagine.

212
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,811
- Tyrion is your family.
- He's not.

213
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,844
- You don't get to choose.
- I do. So do you.

214
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,924
You can choose the creature that killed
our mother to come into this world...

215
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,446
Are you really mad enough
to blame him for that?

216
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,166
He didn't decide to kill her.
He was an infant.

217
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,083
A disease doesn't decide to kill you.

218
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,845
All the same, you cut
it out before it does.

219
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,810
What do you decide?

220
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,487
- What do you choose?
- The things I did to get back to you,

221
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,040
to endure all that, only to find you...

222
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,130
I choose you.

223
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,083
- Those are words.
- Yes.

224
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,164
Like the ones I just said to Father.

225
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,205
I told him.

226
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,006
Told him what?

227
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,809
I told him about us.

228
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,007
- You told him?
- I told him I won't marry Loras Tyrell.

229
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,607
I told him I'm staying right here
with Tommen, with you.

230
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,485
- You think he'll just accept that?
- Go and ask him.

231
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,967
What did you say?

232
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,281
I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister.

233
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,968
I don't choose Tywin Lannister.

234
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:36,204
I don't love Tywin Lannister.
I love my brother.

235
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,685
I love my lover.

236
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,726
People will whisper, they'll
make their jokes. Let them.

237
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,770
They're all so small, I
can't even see them.

238
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,047
I only see what matters.

239
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,685
- Someone will walk in.
- I don't care.

240
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,240
You stand before Daenerys Stormborn,

241
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,561
the Unburnt,

242
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,966
Queen of Meereen,

243
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,962
Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar
and the First Men.

244
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,326
Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea,

245
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,650
Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons.

246
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,643
Thank you for seeing me, Your Grace.

247
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,690
My name is Fennesz.

248
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,249
I can speak the Common Tongue, if you wish.

249
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,084
You speak it very well.

250
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,960
Before you freed me,
I belonged to Master Mighdal.

251
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,204
I was tutor to his children.
I taught them languages and history.

252
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,242
They know a great deal about your family
because of me.

253
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,767
Little Calla is only seven,
but she admires you very much.

254
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,730
I hope I can prove worthy
of her admiration.

255
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,725
What can I do for you?

256
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,682
When you took the city, the children
begged me not to leave the house.

257
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,889
But Master Mighdal and
I agreed that I must.

258
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,761
So I lost my home.

259
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,809
Now I live on the streets.

260
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,564
I have outfitted mess halls

261
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,041
to feed all former slaves
and barracks to shelter them.

262
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,407
I do not mean to offend, Your Grace.

263
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,326
I went to one of these places.

264
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,290
The young prey on the old,

265
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,966
take what they want and
beat us if we resist.

266
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,362
My Unsullied will make them safe again
in short order, my friend,

267
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,646
this I promise you.

268
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,520
Even if they are safe,
who would I be there?

269
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,366
What purpose would I serve?

270
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,809
With my master, I was a teacher.

271
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,521
I had the respect and love of his children.

272
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,648
What is it that you want from me?

273
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,404
Your Grace,

274
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,646
I ask you to let me sell myself
back to Master Mighdal.

275
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,326
You want to return to a man who owned you

276
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,767
like a goat or a chair?

277
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,365
Please, Your Grace.

278
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,683
The young may rejoice in the new world
you have built for them,

279
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,730
but for those of us too old to change,

280
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,850
there is only fear and squalor.

281
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,124
I am not alone.

282
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,049
There are many outside
waiting to beg the same of you.

283
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,842
I did not take this city to preside over
the injustice I fought to destroy.

284
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,605
I took it to bring people freedom.

285
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,326
But freedom means making your own choices.

286
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,809
I will allow you to sign a contract
with your former master.

287
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,282
It may not cover a period
lasting longer than a year.

288
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,403
Thank you, Your Grace.

289
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,124
Thank you.

290
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,966
The masters will take advantage
of this situation.

291
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,128
The men serving them
will be slaves in all but name.

292
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,291
Approach, my friend.

293
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,161
I do not understand, my Queen.

294
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,490
I do not understand, my Queen.

295
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,763
The Queen says you may approach.

296
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,089
I have brought you...

297
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,165
He came from the sky.

298
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,442
The black one.

299
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,806
The winged shadow.

300
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,971
He came from the sky and...

301
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,610
My girl.

302
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,926
My little girl.

303
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,366
What was her name?

304
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,285
Zala, Your Grace.

305
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,523
- How old was she?
- Three.

306
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,609
Three.

307
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,731
And still no word of Drogon?

308
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,168
Sailors saw him flying over the Black
Cliffs three days ago, my Queen.

309
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,565
Nothing since then.

310
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,047
Meet me at the catacombs.

311
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,524
They came to us
from White Harbour and Barrowton,

312
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,650
from Fairmarket and King's Landing,

313
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,643
from north and south,

314
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,848
from east and west.

315
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,844
They died

316
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:31,721
protecting men, women, and children
who will never know their names.

317
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,491
It is for us to remember them.

318
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,289
Our brothers,

319
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,364
we shall never see their like again.

320
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,489
And now their watch is ended.

321
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:47,043
And now their watch is ended.

322
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,371
Your old blind man patched me up.

323
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,881
Why?

324
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,248
He's sworn to treat all wounded men,
friend or foe.

325
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,482
You want me alive so you can torture me?

326
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,886
No one's gonna torture you.

327
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,806
So how do we die? Hanging? Beheading?

328
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,770
Drop us from the top of the Wall?

329
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,842
I don't know what happens to the prisoners.

330
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,771
Who decides?

331
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,402
I suppose Stannis does.

332
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,684
He your king now?

333
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,963
I don't have a king.

334
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,961
You spent too much time with us, Jon Snow.

335
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,683
You can never be a kneeler again.

336
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,040
We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead.

337
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,929
- Do you want to say any words over them?
- Words? What kind of words?

338
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,129
Funeral words.
I don't know how the free folk do it.

339
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,361
Do what?

340
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,611
Say farewell.

341
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,571
The dead can't hear us, boy.

342
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,601
Snow.

343
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,771
Did you love her?

344
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,849
She loved you.

345
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,411
- She told you?
- No.

346
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,570
All she ever talked about was killing you.

347
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,724
That's how I know.

348
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,801
She belongs in the North.

349
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,684
The real North.

350
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,084
You understand me?

351
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,450
We can stop. We can rest.

352
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,682
We'll rest with the three-eyed raven.

353
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,488
We're not going to make it.

354
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,365
We're already here.

355
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,680
Jojen.

356
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,891
Jojen.

357
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,522
Look, Jojen.

358
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,441
Jojen! Come on!

359
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,767
Help them! Now!

360
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,281
Hold on to me!

361
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,961
Hang on!

362
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,641
- Hodor. Hodor.
- Help them!

363
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,241
Hodor.

364
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,886
Hodor!

365
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,724
Hodor!

366
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,441
Hodor.

367
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,446
Hodor!

368
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,840
Bran!

369
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,805
Save yourself, now!

370
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,283
Come with me, Brandon Stark.

371
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,681
He is lost.

372
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,003
Come with me or die with him.

373
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,445
Go with them.

374
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,769
They cannot follow us.

375
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,047
The power that moves
them is powerless here.

376
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,045
Who are you?

377
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:49,728
The First Men called us the Children,
but we were born long before them.

378
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,521
Come, he waits for you.

379
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,401
You're the three-eyed raven?

380
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,681
I've been many things.

381
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,289
Now I am what you see.

382
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,602
My brother, he led us to you and now he...

383
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,967
He knew what would happen.

384
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,521
From the moment he left,

385
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,723
he knew and he went anyway.

386
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,006
How do you know?

387
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,969
I've been watching you.

388
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,965
All of you.

389
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,204
All of your lives.

390
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,962
With 1,000 eyes and one.

391
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,681
Now you've come to me at last,

392
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,808
Brandon Stark.

393
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,968
Though the hour is late.

394
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,928
I didn't want anyone to die for me.

395
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,322
He died so you could
find what you have lost.

396
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,491
You're going to help me walk again?

397
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,091
You will never walk again.

398
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,328
But you will fly.

399
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,044
Podrick.

400
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,843
Podrick.

401
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,371
Where are the horses?

402
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,763
I hobbled them last night.

403
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,370
What sort of hobble?

404
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,044
A figure eight, like you taught me.

405
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,601
If you did it like I taught you,
then the horses would be here.

406
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,721
Thieves, maybe?

407
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,370
It's at least 30 miles
to the Eyrie from here.

408
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,245
You're carrying the saddlebags.

409
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,641
People coming.

410
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,811
You can shit later. There's people coming.

411
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,161
Morning.

412
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,851
Morning.

413
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,401
I like your sword.

414
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,561
Are we getting close to the Bloody Gate?

415
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,566
About 10 more miles.

416
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,729
Did you hear that, Podrick?

417
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,768
Only 10 more miles to the Bloody Gate.

418
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,286
Are you a knight?

419
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,281
No.

420
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,489
But you know how to use that sword?

421
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,610
I do.

422
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,325
Does it have a name?

423
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,650
Oathkeeper.

424
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,131
Mine's Needle.

425
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,371
Good name.

426
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,364
Who taught you how to fight?

427
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,091
My father.

428
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,082
Mine never wanted to.

429
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,367
Said fighting was for boys.

430
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,482
Mine said the same.

431
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,644
But I kept fighting the boys anyway.

432
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,925
Kept losing.

433
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,445
Finally my father said,

434
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,091
"If you're going to do it,
you might as well do it right."

435
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,085
Seven blessings.

436
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,481
I'm Brienne of Tarth.
This is Podrick Payne.

437
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,725
You want something?

438
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,250
That's Sandor Clegane. The Hound.

439
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,164
You're Arya Stark.

440
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,206
I asked if you wanted something.

441
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,886
I swore to your mother
I would bring you home to her.

442
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,051
- My mother's dead.
- I know.

443
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,122
I wish I could have been
there to protect her.

444
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,005
You're not a Northerner.

445
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,363
No, but I swore a sacred
vow to protect her.

446
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,720
Why didn't you?

447
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,611
She commanded me to bring
Jaime Lannister back to King's Landing.

448
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,444
You're paid by the Lannisters.

449
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,050
You're here for the bounty on me.

450
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,805
I'm not paid by the Lannisters.

451
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,961
No?

452
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,529
Fancy sword you've got there.
Where'd you get it?

453
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,887
I've been looking at
Lannister gold all my life.

454
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,610
Go on, Brienne of fucking Tarth.

455
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,728
Tell me that's not Lannister gold.

456
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,890
Jaime Lannister gave me this sword.

457
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,765
The Bloody Gate is 10 miles.

458
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,604
I swore to your mother
by the old gods and the new.

459
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,091
I don't care what you swore.

460
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,650
- Arya!
- You heard the girl.

461
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,485
- She's not coming with you.
- She is.

462
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,086
You're not a good listener.

463
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,921
Valyrian steel?

464
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,844
I always wanted some Valyrian steel.

465
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,685
Come with me, Arya. I'll
take you to safety.

466
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,445
Safety? Where the fuck's that?

467
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,721
Her aunt in the Eyrie is dead.

468
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,724
Her mother's dead. Her father's dead.
Her brother's dead.

469
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,087
Winterfell is a pile of rubble.

470
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,322
There is no safety, you dumb bitch.

471
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,924
You don't know that by now,
you're the wrong one to watch over her.

472
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,367
And that's what you're doing?

473
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,805
Watching over her?

474
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,929
Aye, that's what I'm doing.

475
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,049
I have no wish to kill you, Ser.

476
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,601
I'm not a knight.

477
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:37,725
Arya!

478
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,769
Arya!

479
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,487
- Where is she?
- She was just here.

480
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,641
Why weren't you watching her?

481
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,643
I was watching you.
I thought you might need some help.

482
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,888
Which way, Pod? Which way did she go?

483
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,883
I think that way.

484
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,883
Arya!

485
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,928
Arya!

486
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,642
You still here?

487
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,450
Big bitch saved you.

488
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,971
I don't need saving.

489
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,441
No, not you. You're a real killer.

490
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,927
With your water dancing

491
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,889
and your Needle.

492
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,969
You gonna die?

493
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,566
Unless there's a maester
hiding behind that rock,

494
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,006
aye,

495
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,564
I'm done.

496
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,890
I'd skin you alive for wine.

497
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,009
Fuck water.

498
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,002
Killed by a woman.

499
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,846
I bet you like that.

500
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,364
Go on,

501
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,450
go after her.

502
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,010
She'll help you.

503
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,244
Going it alone,

504
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,207
you won't last a day out there.

505
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,406
I'll last longer than you.

506
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,411
You remember where the heart is?

507
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,724
Fuck it. I'm ready.

508
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,766
Go on, girl.

509
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,127
Another name off your list.

510
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,087
You kept promising me.

511
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:16,050
I cut down your butcher's boy. The ginger.

512
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,842
He was begging for mercy.

513
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,924
"Please, Ser. Please don't kill me.

514
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,008
"Please, please."

515
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,491
Bled all over my horse.

516
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,961
Saddle stunk of butcher's boy for weeks.

517
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,969
And your sister.

518
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,769
Your pretty sister.

519
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,686
I should have taken her.

520
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:47,091
That night the Blackwater burned.

521
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,130
I should have fucked her bloody.

522
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,411
At least I'd have one happy memory.

523
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,802
Do I have to beg you?

524
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,084
Do it.

525
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,924
Do it.

526
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,730
Do it.

527
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,882
Kill me.

528
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,127
Kill me!

529
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,407
Kill me!

530
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:08,881
Kill me!

531
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,881
Oh, get on with it, you son of a whore.

532
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,050
Is that any way to speak about our mother?

533
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,721
- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

534
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,689
A galley's waiting in the bay
bound for the Free Cities.

535
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,250
- Who's helping you?
- Varys.

536
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,561
- Varys?
- You have more friends than you thought.

537
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,844
There's a locked door at
the top of the stairs.

538
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,242
Knock on it twice, then twice again.

539
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,050
Varys will open.

540
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,047
I suppose this is goodbye, then.

541
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,762
Farewell, little brother.

542
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,650
Jaime.

543
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,290
Thank you. For my life.

544
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,209
Quickly now.

545
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,930
Tywin?

546
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,127
My lion.

547
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,325
I'm sorry.

548
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,369
I'm sorry.

549
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,283
Tyrion.

550
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:17,841
Put down the crossbow.

551
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,690
Who released you?

552
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:28,530
Your brother, I expect.
He always had a soft spot for you.

553
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,360
Come, we'll go and talk in my chambers.

554
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,010
This is how you want to speak to me, hmm?

555
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,367
Shaming your father has
always given you pleasure...

556
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,283
All my life

557
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,567
you've wanted me dead.

558
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,521
Yes.

559
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,169
But you refused to die.

560
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,725
I respect that.

561
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,641
Even admire it.

562
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,002
You fight for what's yours.

563
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,729
I'd never let them execute you.
Is that what you fear?

564
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,641
I'll never let Ilyn Payne take your head.

565
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,768
You're a Lannister.

566
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,088
You're my son.

567
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:15,846
I loved her.

568
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:17,886
Who?

569
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,291
Shae.

570
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,411
Oh, Tyrion.

571
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,727
Put down that crossbow.

572
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,040
I murdered her.

573
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,204
With my own hands.

574
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,601
It doesn't matter.

575
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,764
Doesn't matter?

576
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,201
She was a whore.

577
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,842
- Say that word again...
- And what?

578
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,366
You'll kill your own father in the privy?

579
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,046
No.

580
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,086
You're my son.

581
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,525
Now, enough of this nonsense.

582
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,922
I am your son, and you sentenced me to die.

583
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,807
You knew I didn't poison Joffrey,

584
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:02,645
but you sentenced me all the same.

585
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,162
- Why?
- Enough.

586
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,251
We'll go back to my chambers
and speak with some dignity.

587
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:11,005
I can't go back there. She's in there.

588
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,127
You're afraid of a dead whore?

589
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:26,845
You shot me.

590
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,209
You're no son of mine.

591
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:39,520
I am your son.

592
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,687
I have always been your son.

593
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,489
What have you done?

594
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,644
Quickly.

595
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:10,089
Trust me, my friend. I've
brought you this far.

596
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,690
I want to see the captain.

597
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,489
You're seeing him.

598
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,688
I want to go north, to the Wall.

599
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,165
No, you don't.

600
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,411
I can pay.

601
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,563
There is nothing in the North
but ice and war and pirates.

602
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,849
I wouldn't need a cabin. Please.

603
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,570
I could work scrubbing the floors...

604
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,405
I'm not going north, child. I'm going home.

605
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,370
- Where's home?
- The Free City of Braavos.

606
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,250
Wait. I have something else.

607
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:35,927
- More silver won't make a difference.
- It's not silver.

608
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,161
It's iron.

609
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:41,451
This...

610
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,206
- How did you...
- Valar Morghulis.

611
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,649
Valar Dohaeris.

612
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,451
Of course, you shall have a cabin.


1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
<b><font color=#0E7521>Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

2
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,964
We shouldn't be out here alone.

3
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,041
Why not?

4
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,121
If your father...

5
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,964
He'll never know we're gone.

6
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,565
But if he finds out...

7
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,491
You don't need to be afraid of my father.

8
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,163
Are you sure?

9
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,761
Yes.

10
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,970
We shouldn't go in.

11
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,327
Of course we should.

12
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,129
Get out! Get out!

13
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,247
- Let's go.
- No.

14
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,640
Listen to your friend.

15
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,727
They said that you were terrifying,

16
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,929
with cat's teeth and three eyes.

17
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,002
You're not terrifying.

18
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,284
You're boring.

19
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,403
You don't know what I am.

20
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,768
I know you're a witch
and you can see the future.

21
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,210
Tell me mine.

22
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,601
Everyone wants to know their future

23
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,284
until they know their future.

24
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,921
This is my father's land. My land.

25
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,446
Tell me my future,

26
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,286
or I'll have your two boring eyes
gouged out of your head.

27
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,284
Your blood.

28
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,441
Give me a taste.

29
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,482
Three questions you get.

30
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,447
You won't like the answers.

31
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,566
I've been promised to the prince.

32
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,369
When will we marry?

33
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,283
You will never wed the prince.

34
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,403
You will wed the king.

35
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,005
But I will be queen?

36
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,320
Oh, yes.

37
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,163
You'll be queen.

38
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,410
For a time.

39
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,921
Then comes another,

40
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,001
younger,

41
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,763
more beautiful,

42
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,004
to cast you down and take all you hold dear.

43
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,048
Will the king and I have children?

44
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,125
No. The king will have 20 children,

45
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,480
and you will have three.

46
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,647
That doesn't make sense.

47
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,290
Gold will be their crowns.

48
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,805
Gold their shrouds.

49
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,805
Come on, we have to go.

50
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,130
We have to go! Cersei.

51
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,329
Bearers, put it down.

52
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,608
Bearers, up.

53
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,611
Away.

54
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,165
Your Grace, we are honored
by your presence.

55
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,401
The mourners are waiting.

56
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,084
They will keep waiting.

57
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,889
I want a moment alone with him.

58
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,610
But, Your Grace,
many of these lords and ladies

59
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,923
have traveled day and night
to be here from all seven kingdoms.

60
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,445
They Will wait.

61
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,530
He never wanted you to be a Kingsguard,

62
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,482
but here you are, protecting his dead body.

63
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,364
What he built, it's ours.

64
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,406
He built it for us. He meant it for us.

65
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,365
- They're going to try to take it away. All of it.
- They?

66
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,205
All of them out there. Our enemies.

67
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,842
They're waiting in line
to make sure he's really dead.

68
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,763
And as soon as they see
the stones on his eyes,

69
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,524
they'll set to work on tearing us apart.

70
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,365
They have nothing to do with it.

71
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,602
The man who murdered our father,
he tore us apart.

72
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,967
He's the enemy.
I've been telling you for years.

73
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,530
You've been defending him for years.

74
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,931
This is exactly what they want.

75
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,002
And now our father is dead,

76
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,289
and that little monster
is out there somewhere drawing breath.

77
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,842
Did you set him free?

78
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,169
Tyrion may be a monster,
but at least he killed our father on purpose.

79
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,241
You killed him by mistake.

80
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,002
With stupidity.

81
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,004
You're a man of action, aren't you?

82
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,208
When it occurs to you to do something,
you do it.

83
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,648
Never mind the consequences.

84
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,409
Take a look.

85
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,963
Look at the consequences.

86
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,242
Here they are.

87
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,129
He loved you more than anyone in this world.

88
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,363
Apologies.

89
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,481
I still don't see why I had to stay
in this fucking crate once we set sail.

90
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,528
I saved your life.

91
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,251
If they catch you, they catch me.

92
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,405
I cannot say I feel overly guilty
about leaving you in that fucking crate.

93
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,883
Do you know what it's like to stuff your shit
through one of those air holes?

94
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,204
No, I only know what it's like
to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.

95
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,205
Pentos?

96
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,689
The home of my colleague,
Illyrio Mopatis, a merchant.

97
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,731
He and I met many years ago
through mutual friends.

98
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,646
A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon
for the disaster he was.

99
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,561
We tried to do what was best for the realm
by supporting a Targaryen restoration.

100
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,242
And thus began the chain of mistakes
that has led us both here.

101
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,201
Things have gotten worse, not better.

102
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,489
Westeros needs to be saved from itself.

103
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,241
Mmm.

104
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,491
Much better.

105
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,484
My lord?

106
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,886
I don't think I am anymore.

107
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,489
A lord.

108
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,124
Are you a lord if you kill your father?

109
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,725
I don't imagine they revoke your nobility
for killing a whore.

110
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,604
It must happen all the time.

111
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,808
You already drank yourself
across the Narrow Sea.

112
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,248
In a box. Why stop now?

113
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,244
Because we are talking
about the future of our country.

114
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,210
The future is shit.

115
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,002
Just like the past.

116
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,166
You want the same?

117
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,846
Same as always?

118
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,006
You...

119
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,924
you don't have to.

120
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,845
Habit.

121
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,250
The Sons of the Harpy?

122
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,322
Yes, Your Grace.
They left it on the body.

123
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,164
They've never killed before.

124
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,447
It was only a matter of time, Your Grace.

125
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,727
Conquerors always meet with resistance.

126
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,121
I didn't conquer them. Their own people did.

127
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,328
They do not see us as people, Your Grace.

128
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,486
Then they will have to learn to see
things differently, Mossador.

129
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,841
He did not risk his life
fighting for his freedom

130
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,570
so cowards in masks could take it away.

131
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,968
And I did not take up residence
in this pyramid

132
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,965
so I could watch the city below
decline into chaos.

133
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,202
What was the name of the man you lost?

134
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,926
White Rat, Your Grace.

135
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,164
I want him buried with honor, publically,

136
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,601
in the Temple of the Graces.

137
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,688
The Sons of the Harpy will hear that message.

138
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,290
Make them very angry.

139
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,362
Angry snakes lash out.

140
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,171
Makes chopping off their heads
that much easier.

141
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,290
Find the men who did this
and bring them to me.

142
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,765
Your Grace.

143
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,811
I wanted to speak with you.

144
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,201
Why do you come?

145
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,329
White Rat, the Unsullied who...

146
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,284
I have heard they found
his body in a brothel.

147
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:32,290
I have heard that more than one Unsullied
has been known to visit Meereen's brothels.

148
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,849
May I ask you why?

149
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,326
Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel?

150
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,642
I do not know.

151
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,204
I must go.

152
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,843
- Get your shield up.
- It's too heavy.

153
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,049
If it wasn't heavy, it wouldn't stop a sword.
Now get it up.

154
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,246
Come. Try it again.

155
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,245
Drive at me. Keep your shield up,
or I'll ring your head like a bell.

156
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,882
Shouldn't you be training, too?

157
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,763
Well, I'm hardly a new recruit.

158
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,801
How many brothers can say that
they've killed a White Walker and a Thenn?

159
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,325
I might be the first in history.

160
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,843
- Shield up.
- These men need a firm hand.

161
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,687
Always have.

162
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,645
They're poachers and thieves.

163
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,289
Not soldiers.

164
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,007
That one hates me.

165
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,241
If Ser Alliser is chosen
as the new Lord Commander...

166
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,811
He hates the wildlings.

167
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,645
All the wildlings.

168
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,882
- Don't let them send us away.
- It's not a sure thing.

169
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,770
Ser Denys Mallister has commanded
the Shadow Tower for 20 years,

170
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,560
and people say he's a good man.
He's running against Ser Alliser...

171
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,001
Sam, don't let them send us away.

172
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,249
I told you.

173
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,802
Wherever you go, I go, too.

174
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,042
You can't leave. They'll execute you.

175
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,890
Good, good, pivot. Don't forget to pivot.

176
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,761
Shield up.

177
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,488
The king wants a word.

178
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,921
You're not cold, my lady?

179
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,324
Never.

180
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,084
The Lord's fire lives within me, Jon Snow.

181
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,361
Feel.

182
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,967
Are you a virgin?

183
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,131
No.

184
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,486
Good.

185
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,171
Your Grace.

186
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,406
The bastard of Winterfell.

187
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,963
You know who rules at Winterfell now?

188
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,566
Roose Bolton.

189
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,730
Hmm. The traitor who plunged a dagger
in Robb Stark's heart.

190
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,565
Don't you want to avenge him?

191
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,202
I want a great many things, Your Grace.

192
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,408
But I'm a sworn brother
of the Night's Watch now.

193
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,850
I've been talking to your sworn brothers.

194
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,570
- Many of them love you.
- They're good men.

195
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,324
Many don't.

196
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,440
You were seen taking the body
of a wildling girl north of the Wall.

197
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,046
Why?

198
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,690
It's where she belonged.

199
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,082
Some of the Night's Watch feel you have
too much affection for the wildlings.

200
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,323
They were born on the wrong side of the Wall.

201
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,164
That doesn't make them monsters.

202
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,321
No matter.

203
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,971
I shall take back the North
from the thieves who stole it.

204
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,651
Tywin Lannister is dead.
He can't protect them now.

205
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,805
I shall mount Roose Bolton's head on a spike.

206
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,763
But if I'm to take Winterfell,
I need more men.

207
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,806
The men of the Night's Watch
are sworn to play no part...

208
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,928
I'm not talking about the damn Night's Watch.

209
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,929
I'm talking about the wildlings.

210
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,125
Your Grace,

211
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,762
you want the wildlings
to march in your army?

212
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,569
If they swear to follow me, I'll pardon them.

213
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,687
We'll take Winterfell.

214
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,491
Once the North is won,
I'll declare them citizens of the realm.

215
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,891
I'll give them land to live on.

216
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,128
It's a fair offer. More than fair.

217
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,089
I'll offer them their lives and their freedom

218
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,130
if Mance kneels before me
and swears his loyalty.

219
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,641
I don't think that's likely.

220
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,281
You admire him, don't you?

221
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,850
I respect him.

222
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,160
He likes you.

223
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,403
- Convince him to bend the knee, or he burns.
- Your Grace.

224
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,891
How much time do I have?

225
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,360
Nightfall.

226
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,847
The sun drops fast this time of year.

227
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,684
Hurry, Jon Snow.

228
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,967
Shield up.

229
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,523
Attack, my lord!

230
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,244
Attack!

231
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,967
Don't cross your feet.

232
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,769
My sons had swords in their hands
from the time they could walk. This one...

233
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,043
Lord Arryn
will never be a great warrior.

234
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,963
Great warrior?

235
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,651
He swings a sword like a girl with palsy.

236
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,887
My lord.

237
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,410
Sword up, my lord!

238
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,849
Some boys
develop more slowly.

239
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,127
He's still young.

240
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,204
He's 13.
Boys go to war at 13.

241
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,806
- He has other gifts.
- Does he?

242
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,008
The gift of a great name.

243
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,642
Sometimes that's all one needs.

244
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,490
Good-bye, Lord Royce,
and thank you for all you've done for me.

245
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,961
I have done nothing more
than my duty, my lady.

246
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,405
I have no doubt that on my return,

247
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,131
Robin's skills will have
improved immeasurably.

248
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,365
He'll be safe here.

249
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,248
As for his skills,

250
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,727
I make no promises.

251
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,682
Will we head north at some point?

252
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,287
He said Sansa had a brother at Castle Black.

253
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,647
We're a few days' ride from the King's Road.

254
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,087
- But that will take us...
- Us?

255
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,126
The only reason you're here

256
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,090
is because Jaime Lannister
told me you weren't safe in the capital.

257
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,164
You're hundreds of miles
from King's Landing.

258
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,163
No one knows what you look like.

259
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,244
No one cares. You're safe.

260
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,085
- But I'm your squire.
- Do you even know what a squire is?

261
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,407
An attendant to a knight.

262
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,045
I'm not a knight.

263
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,248
That means you're not a squire.

264
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,641
Well, where would I go?

265
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,371
I don't care. I'm not your mother.

266
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,083
You swore to find the Stark girls.

267
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,846
I found Arya. She didn't want my protection.

268
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,161
- Sansa still might.
- Will you shut your mouth?

269
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,282
I didn't ask for your advice.

270
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,047
I don't want anyone following me.
I'm not a leader.

271
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,486
All I ever wanted
was to fight for a lord I believed in.

272
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,801
The good lords are dead,
and the rest are monsters.

273
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,846
You told Lord Royce
we were going to the Fingers.

274
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,285
I did.

275
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,085
- But we're heading west.
- We are.

276
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,288
If he wanted to betray us,
he already would have.

277
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,523
Lord Royce might be as honorable
as he thinks he is,

278
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,807
but he's not alone in that castle.

279
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,925
Do you trust all those knights and ladies,
stable boys and serving girls?

280
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,163
No, do you trust the carriage driver
or the knights escorting us?

281
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,084
No.

282
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,921
But I pay them well,

283
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,446
and they've seen what happens
to men who disappoint me.

284
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,646
So where are we going?

285
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,247
To a land where you trust everyone?

286
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,971
To a land so far from here,

287
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,930
even Cersei Lannister
can't get her hands on you.

288
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,207
It was such a deep, deep shock to us all.

289
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,483
Your father was a...

290
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,370
A force to be reckoned with. He truly was.

291
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,203
I wouldn't presume to claim
to have known him as such, but...

292
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,805
But just being in his presence was enough

293
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,484
to make it so clear

294
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,730
just how formidable
a person you were dealing with.

295
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,562
What a force to be reckoned with.

296
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,287
Thank you so much for your kind words.

297
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,323
Deepest condolences, Your Grace.

298
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,564
This tragedy... I never trusted Varys.
I often warned...

299
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,401
Your Grace.

300
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,681
Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.

301
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,001
My deepest sympathies.

302
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,210
I apologize for my son's appearance.

303
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,725
Uncle, that's quite all right.

304
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,405
They call themselves Sparrows.

305
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,289
Bloody fanatics.

306
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,331
Religion has its place, of course,
but at a certain point...

307
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,084
They never would have come
to the capital when Tywin was alive.

308
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,448
I'm sure he'll grow out of it,
whatever it is.

309
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,288
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

310
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,286
Your wounds from the Blackwater
seem to have healed.

311
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,569
It wasn't my wounds that needed healing.

312
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,483
What can I do for you?

313
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,802
You can forgive me.

314
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,406
What could you possibly have done
to warrant my forgiveness?

315
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,167
I led you into the darkness.

316
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,726
I doubt you've ever led anyone anywhere.

317
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,610
I tempted you into our...

318
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,125
unnatural relations.

319
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,648
And, of course, there was the king,

320
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,648
his boar hunt.

321
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,327
His wine.

322
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,481
I don't know what you're talking about.

323
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,282
I'm a different person now.

324
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,684
I've found peace in the light of the Seven.

325
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,246
You can, too.

326
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,166
They watch over all of us,
ready to dole out mercy

327
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,921
or justice.

328
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,762
Their world is at hand.

329
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,005
I will pray for your father's soul.

330
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,561
The day Tywin Lannister's soul
needs your help...

331
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,446
- It looks like Dorne.
- It doesn't.

332
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,880
It does.

333
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,730
That's the Sunspear bit, right there.

334
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,405
And that's where the mountains are.

335
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,562
And over here is...

336
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,806
Is Sunsnake?

337
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,207
Stonespear?

338
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,884
Sandstone.

339
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,450
Yes.

340
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,761
Yes, Sandstone.

341
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,561
Just there.

342
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,286
Fine.

343
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,725
It's Dorne.

344
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,924
We should go there.

345
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,649
I think we would have a lovely time,

346
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,808
Judging by my experience.

347
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,881
That would be wonderful.

348
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,561
Dorne, Highgarden.

349
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,809
Anywhere but here.

350
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,450
We're late for dinner as it is.

351
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,927
You're very respectful.

352
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,809
I'm very hungry.

353
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,410
What's your name?

354
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,810
Olyvar, my lady.

355
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:17,126
I'm afraid my brother
is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar.

356
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,931
My lady.

357
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,320
Perhaps you might consider
being a bit more discreet?

358
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,004
Why?

359
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,048
They all know about me anyway.

360
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,489
Everybody knows everything about everyone.

361
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,608
What's the point in trying to
keep a secret in a place like this?

362
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,729
In any event,
you shouldn't keep your intended waiting.

363
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,170
My intended? Please.

364
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,931
Tywin's dead.

365
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,968
That means no one
can force Cersei to marry me.

366
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,929
- Lucky you.
- Unlucky you.

367
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,162
You think I want that woman
married to my brother?

368
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,006
If she doesn't marry me,
she doesn't go to Highgarden.

369
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,208
Which means she stays in King's Landing.

370
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,366
Which means you're trapped here
with Cersei Lannister as your mother by law.

371
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,681
Perhaps.

372
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,841
Perhaps?

373
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,049
Perhaps.

374
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,291
Eunuch, the spider, the Master of Whisperers.

375
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,967
Imp, halfman.

376
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,209
There are faster ways to kill yourself.

377
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,243
Not for a coward.

378
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,369
You are many things, my friend,
but not a coward.

379
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,881
You never told me why

380
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,366
you set me free.

381
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,522
Your brother asked me to.

382
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,004
Could have said no.

383
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,367
Refuse the Kingslayer?
A dangerous proposition.

384
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,681
Not as dangerous as releasing me.

385
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,321
You risked your life,
your position, everything.

386
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,324
Why? You're not family.
You owe me nothing.

387
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,767
I didn't do it for you.

388
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,842
I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.

389
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,163
A drunken dwarf will never be
the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.

390
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,288
I don't believe in saviors.

391
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,802
I believe men of talent
have a part to play in the war to come.

392
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,330
You're going to have to find another soldier.

393
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,205
I'm done with Westeros,
and Westeros is done with me.

394
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,811
You have many admirable qualities,
self-pity is not one of them.

395
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,402
Any fool with a bit of luck
can find himself born into power.

396
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,280
But earning it for yourself, that takes work.

397
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,571
I'm not well-suited for work.

398
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,051
I think you are.

399
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,805
You have your father's
instincts for politics,

400
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,041
and you have compassion.

401
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,407
Compassion? Yes.

402
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,843
I killed my lover with my bare hands.

403
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,810
I shot my own father with a crossbow.

404
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,849
I never said you were perfect.

405
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,804
What is it you want exactly?

406
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,370
Peace.

407
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,810
Prosperity.

408
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,203
A land where the powerful
do not prey on the powerless.

409
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,521
Where the castles are made of gingerbread,

410
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,171
and the moats are filled
with blackberry wine.

411
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,602
The powerful have always
preyed on the powerless.

412
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,001
That's how they became powerful
in the first place.

413
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,923
Perhaps.

414
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,245
And perhaps we've grown so used to horror,
we assume there's no other way.

415
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,762
If you sat on the Iron Throne,

416
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,127
would you spread misery
throughout the land?

417
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,931
I will never sit on the Iron Throne.

418
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,764
No, you won't.

419
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:55,971
But you could help another climb those steps
and take that seat.

420
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,884
The Seven Kingdoms
need someone stronger than Tommen,

421
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,281
but gentler than Stannis.

422
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,762
A monarch who can intimidate
the high lords and inspire the people.

423
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:09,847
A ruler loved by millions with a
powerful army and the right family name.

424
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,202
Good luck finding him.

425
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,367
Who said anything about "him"?

426
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,408
You have a choice, my friend.

427
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,202
You can stay here at Illyrio's palace
and drink yourself to death,

428
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,807
or you can ride with me to Meereen,
meet Daenerys Targaryen,

429
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,406
and decide if the world
is worth fighting for.

430
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,841
Can I drink myself to death
on the road to Meereen?

431
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,084
When did the Unsullied
start patrolling the streets of Meereen?

432
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,164
Looks like your friends
haven't been behaving themselves.

433
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,004
Our mission to Yunkai
was a resounding success.

434
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,367
The Wise Masters of Yunkai
have agreed to cede power

435
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,002
to a council of elders made up of both
the freed men and the former slaveholders.

436
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,129
All matters of consequence
will be brought to you for review.

437
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,850
Good.

438
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,445
They did ask for some concessions.

439
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,891
Concessions?

440
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,122
Politics is the art of compromise,
Your Grace.

441
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,090
I'm not a politician. I'm a queen.

442
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,211
Forgive me. You're right, of course.

443
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,166
Still, it's easier to rule happy subjects
than angry ones.

444
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,802
I don't expect the Wise Masters to be happy.

445
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,123
Slavery made them rich.
I ended slavery.

446
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,124
They do not ask for the return of slavery.

447
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,885
They ask for the reopening
of the fighting pits.

448
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,405
The fighting pits?

449
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,006
Where slaves fought slaves to the death?

450
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,165
In the new world that you've brought to us,
free men would fight free men.

451
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,122
The pit fighters you liberated
pled for this opportunity.

452
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,643
Bring some here and ask them yourself.

453
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,721
No fighting pits.

454
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,321
Opening them would
show the people of Yunkai and Meereen

455
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,970
that you respect their traditions.

456
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,084
I do not respect
the tradition of human cockfighting.

457
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,247
If you...

458
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,607
How many times must I say no
before you understand?

459
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,405
Whatever he wants from me,
he's not going to get it.

460
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,926
If he really believes
I'm going to reopen the fighting pits...

461
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,240
You should reopen the fighting pits.

462
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,290
What?

463
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,886
My mother was a whore.
I told you that.

464
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,286
She liked to drink pear brandy.

465
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,930
The older she got,

466
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,004
the less she made selling her body,
the more she wanted to drink.

467
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,764
So one day when I was 12,

468
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,003
she sold me to a slaver
she fucked the night before.

469
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,044
I'm sorry.

470
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,771
Why? I was a bad child.

471
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,647
I wasn't big, but I was quick

472
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,926
and I loved to fight.

473
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,289
So they sold me to a man in Tolos
who trained fighters for the pits.

474
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,806
I had my first match when I was 16.

475
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,605
You were sold into slavery,

476
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,126
forced to fight to the death
for the amusement of the masters,

477
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,282
and you're defending the fighting pits?

478
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,330
I'm only here because of those pits.

479
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,721
I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer,

480
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,451
a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight.

481
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,846
Soon I was famous.

482
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,925
Ten thousand men and women screamed
my name when I stepped into the pit.

483
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,971
I made so much money for my master,
he set me free when he died.

484
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,528
I joined the Second Sons,

485
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,250
and then I met you.

486
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,203
You're the queen.

487
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,681
Everyone's too afraid of you to speak truth.

488
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,247
Everyone but me.

489
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,402
You've made thousands of enemies
all across the world.

490
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,165
As soon as they see weakness,

491
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,924
they'll attack.

492
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,842
Show your strength here, now.

493
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,161
That's why I have the Unsullied
patrolling the streets.

494
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,923
Anyone with a chest full of gold
can buy an army of Unsullied.

495
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,046
You're not the Mother of Unsullied.

496
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,650
You're the Mother of Dragons.

497
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,765
I don't want another child's bones
dropped at my feet.

498
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,126
No one's seen Drogon in weeks.

499
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,131
For all I know,
he's flown halfway across the world.

500
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,889
I can't control them anymore.

501
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,284
A dragon queen with no dragons

502
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,162
is not a queen.

503
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,649
Viserion?

504
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,929
Rhaegal?

505
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,006
Easy. Easy.

506
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,930
Easy.

507
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,048
So here we are.

508
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,122
Here we are.

509
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,011
When we first met,
you were my prisoner.

510
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,163
And now, for our last meeting...

511
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,567
This doesn't have to be our last meeting.

512
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,166
No, but it will be.

513
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,961
You know what Stannis wants?

514
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,520
He wants me to bend the knee.

515
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,967
And he wants the free folk to fight for him.

516
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,130
I'll give him this much, he's bold.

517
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,884
Shouldn't a king be bold?

518
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,805
Oh, aye.

519
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,010
I respect him.

520
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,210
If he gets what he wants,
I expect he'll be a better ruler

521
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,126
than the fools sitting on the Iron Throne
the last hundred years.

522
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,567
But I'll never serve him.

523
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,725
You told me you weren't here to conquer.

524
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,040
You told me your people have bled enough.

525
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,491
That's right.

526
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,687
I don't want them
bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either.

527
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:50,563
You spent your life convincing 90 clans to
come together for the first time in history.

528
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,688
Thenns and Hornfoots,

529
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,604
the ice-river clans, even the giants.

530
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,649
A life's work uniting them.

531
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,845
You didn't do it for power.
You didn't do it for glory.

532
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,850
You brought them together to save them

533
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,523
because none of them will survive the winter,
not if they're north of the Wall.

534
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,768
Isn't their survival
more important than your pride?

535
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,049
Pride?

536
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,208
Fuck my pride.

537
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,568
This isn't about that.

538
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:26,046
Then bend the knee and save your people.

539
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,128
They followed me because they respected me.

540
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,964
Because they believed in me.

541
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,281
The moment I kneel for a southern king,
that's all gone.

542
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:38,648
And how many tens of thousands
are out there right now?

543
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,888
How many women?
How many children?

544
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,049
And you won't go out
and rescue them because why?

545
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,123
You're afraid of looking afraid.

546
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,530
Oh, I am afraid.

547
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,931
No shame in that.

548
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,840
How will they do it?

549
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,605
Beheading?

550
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,045
Hanging?

551
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,245
They'll burn you alive.

552
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,208
Bad way to go.

553
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,763
I'll be honest with you.

554
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,002
I don't want to die.

555
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,684
And burned to death?

556
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,607
I don't want people to remember me like that,
scorched and screaming.

557
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,003
But it's better than
betraying everything I believe.

558
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,489
And what happens to your people?

559
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,562
You preserve your dignity and die standing,

560
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,768
and they'll sing songs about you.

561
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,441
You'd rather burn than kneel.

562
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,204
The great hero.

563
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,648
Until winter comes,
and the White Walkers come for us all,

564
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,121
and there's no one left to sing.

565
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,288
You're a good lad.

566
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,801
Truly you are.

567
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,164
But if you can't understand

568
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,290
why I won't enlist my people
in a foreigner's war,

569
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,881
there's no point explaining.

570
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,849
I think you're making a terrible mistake.

571
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,565
The freedom to make my own mistakes
was all I ever wanted.

572
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,167
Mance Rayder, you have been
called the King-beyond-the-Wall.

573
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,720
Westeros only has one king.

574
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,282
Bend the knee,
I promise you mercy.

575
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,764
Kneel and live.

576
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,088
This was my home for many years.

577
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,887
I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.

578
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,324
We all must choose.

579
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,087
Man or woman, young or old,

580
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,448
lord or peasant, our choices are the same.

581
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,286
We choose light, or we choose darkness.

582
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,045
We choose good, or we choose evil.

583
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:34,690
We choose the true god or the false.

584
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,650
Free folk,

585
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,083
there is only one true king,

586
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,200
and his name is Stannis.

587
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,601
Here stands your king of lies.

588
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,843
Behold the fate of those
who choose the darkness.

589
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:38,500
<b><font color=#0E7521>Ripped By mstoll</font></b>
1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
<b><font color=#0E7521>Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

2
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,044
We're going to Braavos!

3
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,960
In the old times,
whenever Braavos stood in danger,

4
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,522
the Titan would step with fire in his eyes.

5
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,487
He'd wade into the sea
and smash the enemies.

6
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,645
He's just a statue.

7
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,846
Don't be afraid. He's announcing our arrival.

8
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,082
I'm not afraid.

9
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,884
The House of Black and White.

10
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,410
This is where you'll find the man you seek.

11
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,447
Here I leave you.

12
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,370
Thank you for bringing me.

13
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,011
Any man of Braavos
would have done the same.

14
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,161
Valar Morghulis.

15
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,523
Valar Dohaeris.

16
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,405
Hello.

17
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,763
Valar Morghulis.

18
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,921
Um...

19
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,085
Jaqen H'ghar gave me this.

20
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,009
No one here by that name.

21
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,881
Please.

22
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,964
I crossed the Narrow Sea.
I have nowhere else to go.

23
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,963
You have everywhere else to go.

24
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,730
But wait...

25
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,564
Cersei.

26
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,930
Walder Frey.

27
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,524
The Mountain.

28
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,210
Meryn Trant.

29
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,444
Cersei.

30
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,331
Walder Frey.

31
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,245
The Mountain.

32
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,531
Meryn Trant.

33
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,490
Cersei. Walder Frey.

34
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,130
The Mountain.

35
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,490
Meryn Trant.

36
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,684
Cersei.

37
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,370
Walder Frey.

38
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,170
The Mountain.

39
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,890
Meryn Trant.

40
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,170
Cersei.

41
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,809
Walder Frey.

42
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,849
The Mountain.

43
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,930
Meryn Trant.

44
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,520
Must be good food if it's crowded.

45
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,320
Ale?

46
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,330
Ale?

47
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,011
Before we left,
a maester gave you a raven scroll.

48
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,207
You are becoming an observant young lady.

49
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,006
My mother used to say,
"Dark wings, dark words."

50
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,522
An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.

51
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,530
Excuse me.

52
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,886
So, it was good news?

53
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,682
My marriage proposal has been accepted.

54
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,645
I thought you still mourned
the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.

55
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,801
Ale?

56
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,527
I'll have some.

57
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,841
My lady.

58
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,327
What is it?

59
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,686
Sansa Stark. Don't look.

60
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,561
You sure?

61
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,165
She's dyed her hair, but it's her.

62
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,685
She's sitting with Petyr Baelish.

63
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,046
Littlefinger?

64
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,645
A bunch of knights with him.

65
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,603
A bunch? What's a bunch, Podrick? Six? 20?

66
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,961
Ten, I think. Too many.

67
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,451
My lady, I don't think this is the right...

68
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,364
- Ready the horses.
- We only have one horse.

69
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,249
Find more.

70
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,849
Do you like the taste?

71
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,922
I don't see what all the fuss is about.

72
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,046
Why do men love it so much?

73
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,168
It gives some men courage.

74
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,522
Does it give you courage?

75
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,201
That's far enough.

76
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,090
Lord Baelish, Lady Sansa.

77
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,408
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

78
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,687
We've met with Renly Baratheon.

79
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,002
What did he say about you?

80
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,048
He said

81
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,885
your loyalty came free of charge.

82
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,806
Someone appears to have
paid quite a bit for it since then.

83
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,164
Lady Sansa,

84
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,124
before your mother's death,

85
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,726
I was her sworn sword.

86
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,724
I gave my word
I would find you and protect you.

87
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,010
I will shield your back and keep your counsel

88
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,765
and give my life for yours if need be.

89
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,969
I swear it by the Old Gods and the New.

90
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,048
Please, Lady Brienne,

91
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,407
no need for such formality.

92
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,608
You were Catelyn Stark's sworn sword?

93
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,762
- I was.
- Strange.

94
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,330
I knew Cat from the time we were children.

95
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,169
She never mentioned you.

96
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,163
It was after Renly's murder.

97
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,321
Ah. Yes.

98
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,130
You were accused of killing him.

99
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,766
- I tried to save him.
- But you were accused.

100
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,922
By men who didn't see what happened.

101
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,490
And what did happen?

102
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,283
He was murdered by a shadow.

103
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,001
A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon.

104
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,170
A shadow?

105
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,848
With the face...

106
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,202
This woman
swore to protect Renly.

107
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,651
She failed.

108
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,883
She swore to protect your mother. She failed.

109
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,040
Why would I want somebody
with your history of failure

110
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,121
guarding Lady Sansa?

111
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,362
Why should you have any say in her affairs?

112
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,805
Because I am her uncle.

113
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,362
I married her Aunt Lysa
shortly before my beloved's untimely death.

114
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,444
We're family now, and you are an outsider.

115
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,567
Forgive me, Lady Brienne,

116
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,166
but experience has made me
wary of outsiders.

117
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,326
Lady Sansa, if we can have a word alone...

118
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,401
No.

119
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,609
Please, my lady. If I could explain...

120
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,206
I saw you at Joffrey's wedding
bowing to the king.

121
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,886
Neither of us wanted to be there.

122
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,491
Sometimes we don't have a choice.

123
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,483
And sometimes we do.

124
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,604
You should leave.

125
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,565
We don't want our new friend
wandering the countryside alone.

126
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,608
The roads in these parts aren't safe.

127
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,841
Why don't you stay?

128
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,050
The man asked you to stay...

129
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,370
Hyah! Hyah!

130
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,291
Hyah! Hyah!

131
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,925
After her!

132
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,126
- Yah! Hah!
- Oh!

133
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,088
- Stop!
- I'll take him!

134
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,249
Podrick!

135
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,684
Hold on to her!

136
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,650
Take her!

137
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,691
Keep moving!

138
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,569
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

139
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,083
That's a good boy. Come on. Come on.

140
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,044
No, no, no, stop!

141
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,210
I guess that means you're unarmed.

142
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,971
Down, Podrick! Down!

143
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,761
Podrick.

144
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,926
Yes. my lady?

145
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,164
You can stand now.

146
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,241
Yes, my lady.

147
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,603
Sansa Stark?

148
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,527
Wary of strangers, as she should be.

149
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,967
I saw her riding on the East Road
with Littlefinger.

150
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,087
We'll follow them.

151
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,729
My lady,
If both Stark girls refused your service,

152
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,325
maybe you're released from your vow.

153
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,688
I swore to their mother
I would protect those girls.

154
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,761
But if they don't want your protection...

155
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,047
Do you think she's safe with Littlefinger?

156
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,330
No, my lady.

157
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,129
Get your horse.

158
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,488
A summons from the queen.

159
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,767
There are only
two like it in the world.

160
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,206
The one I'm wearing,
the one I gave to Myrcella.

161
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,011
- It's a threat.
- Of course it's a threat.

162
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,250
Our daughter's alone in Dorne
surrounded by people who hate our family.

163
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,482
"It's a threat."

164
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,081
No note?

165
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,209
They blame us for the death
of Oberyn and his sister

166
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,443
and every other tragedy
that's befallen their cursed country.

167
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,000
I will burn their cities to the ground
if they touch her.

168
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,889
- Softer.
- What?

169
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,961
Not so loud.

170
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,884
Our daughter's in danger
and you're worried I'm speaking too loudly?

171
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,247
The world can't know she's our daughter.

172
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,927
Then don't call her your daughter.

173
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,530
You've never been a father to her.

174
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,080
If I was a father to any of my children,
they'd be stoned in the street.

175
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,202
And what has your caution brought?

176
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,724
Our eldest child murdered
at his own wedding.

177
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,207
Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne.

178
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,764
Our baby boy set to marry
that smirking whore from Highgarden.

179
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,921
I'm going to make things better.

180
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,490
You've never made anything better.

181
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,042
I'm going to Dorne
and I'm bringing our daughter home.

182
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,961
You can’t just ask Prince Doran
to give her back.

183
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,405
She's promised to his son.

184
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,406
I'm not going to ask him anything.

185
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,482
You go down there with an army,
it's an act of war.

186
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,289
No army.

187
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,521
Do you know where they're keeping her?

188
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,404
- Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.
- I’ll find her.

189
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,923
Is there anything else, Your Grace?

190
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,804
You're going to Dorne?

191
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,367
A one-handed man, alone.

192
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,602
I never said I was going alone.

193
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,365
No sunflowers. I don't like yellow.

194
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,602
Roses are very nice. Definitely roses.

195
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,366
And music. I adore music.
But no flutes. I hate flutes.

196
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,488
We can have a harp if you like,
but no flutes.

197
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,881
Then there's the food.
Food is the most important thing.

198
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,531
Don't you agree?
We're going to need pigeon pies.

199
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,807
That's what they eat in
the capital, don't they?

200
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,004
Don't they?

201
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,327
Don't who?

202
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,370
People eat pigeon pie in the capital.

203
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,529
They certainly do, my dear.

204
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,121
It's a fine place, isn't it?

205
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,645
A fine place.

206
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,291
I never thought I'd end up
settling down in a place like this.

207
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,966
You won't.

208
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,041
Pardon?

209
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,088
We won't get to live at Stokeworth.

210
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,448
When Mother dies, my sister gets the castle
because she's older.

211
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,931
She hates me.

212
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,321
She calls me mean names,
and sometimes, even still,

213
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,290
she pulls my hair when Mother's not looking.

214
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,842
You know what I think?

215
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,048
I think you're a good person.

216
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,122
And your sister is a mean person.

217
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,690
She is.

218
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,603
I've been all over the world,

219
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,728
and if there's one thing I've learned,

220
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,962
it's that meanness comes around.

221
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,809
People like your sister,

222
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,362
they always get
what's coming to them eventually.

223
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,408
One way or another.

224
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,204
Who's that?

225
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,162
Jaime fucking Lannister.

226
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,810
- Ser Jaime.
- Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

227
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,480
I was very sorry to hear about your father.

228
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,005
Thank you.

229
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,125
This is my betrothed, Lollys.

230
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,886
A pleasure.

231
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,404
Run along, love.

232
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,802
Beautiful young bride you've chosen.

233
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,004
When were you planning on getting married?

234
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,401
- Just get on with it.
- On with what?

235
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,970
What you're here for.

236
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,970
There's no way this little visit could
possibly mean anything good for me.

237
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,084
It's very good for you.

238
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,243
- Lollys will be marrying Ser Willis Bracken.
- Mmm.

239
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,641
We made a deal, your sister and I.

240
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,241
I would have advised against that.

241
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,761
How is this good for me?

242
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,969
'Cause you're going to come with me
and help me with something important.

243
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,485
And when we return,

244
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,087
I'm going to give you a much better girl
and a much better castle.

245
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,282
Return from where?

246
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,562
As far south as south goes.

247
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,962
My future queen.

248
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,723
You are beautiful.

249
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,768
The prince does not wish to be disturbed.

250
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,688
Remove yourself from my path or I'll take
that long ax and I'll shove it up your...

251
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,330
Captain.

252
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,007
Let her pass.

253
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,807
Your brother was murdered,

254
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,329
and you sit here in the Water Gardens,
staring at the sky and doing nothing.

255
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,610
Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat.
By law, that is not murder.

256
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,081
- Your brother.
- You don't have to remind me.

257
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,004
He was my brother
long before he was anything to you.

258
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,006
What will you do about his death?

259
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,606
I will bury him. I will mourn for him.

260
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,727
And then?

261
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,285
You would have me go to war?

262
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,725
The whole country would have you go to war.

263
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,644
Then we are lucky
the whole country does not decide.

264
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,884
The Sand Snakes are with me.

265
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,650
They have the love of their people.

266
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,443
They will avenge their father while
you sit here in your chair doing nothing.

267
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,691
Oberyn is dead,

268
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,565
and this Lannister girl
skips about the Water Gardens,

269
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,446
eating our food, breathing our air.

270
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,646
How many of your brothers and sisters
do they have to kill?

271
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,765
Let me have her.

272
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,327
Let me send her to Cersei
one finger at a time.

273
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,122
I loved my brother.

274
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,402
And you made him very happy.

275
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,610
For that, you will always
have a place in my heart.

276
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,088
But we do not mutilate little girls
for vengeance.

277
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,445
Not here.

278
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,171
Not while I rule.

279
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,643
And how long will that be?

280
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,922
The Unsullied are too conspicuous.

281
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,290
Anyone can see you coming from a mile off.

282
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,283
Of course you haven't found
any Sons of the Harpy.

283
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,763
You haven't, have you?

284
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,524
My Second Sons, on the other hand,

285
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,331
they drink, whore,

286
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,209
fight in the streets,

287
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,691
they blend in.

288
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,161
They overhear things in taverns,

289
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,926
follow people to nice, quiet alleys,

290
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,048
break a few fingers,

291
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,849
overhear a few more things.

292
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,124
Before you know it...

293
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,601
No one here.

294
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,285
We go.

295
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,125
In a hurry? You're afraid?

296
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,168
Unsullied fear nothing.

297
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,685
Right.

298
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,131
That's your problem.

299
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,171
You understood fear once long ago,
but you've forgotten what it means.

300
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,526
Someone who's forgotten fear

301
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,610
has forgotten how to hide.

302
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,887
Fear is useful that way.

303
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,323
Sons of the Harpy,
they want to put a collar back on my neck.

304
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,083
On all of our necks.
Please, Your Grace, you must kill him.

305
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,446
It would send a message.

306
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,161
I think you should exercise restraint,
Your Grace.

307
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,287
Why?

308
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,084
For one thing,
he may have valuable information.

309
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,050
The Son of the Harpy
has no more valuable information.

310
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,440
How do you know that?

311
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,443
Because I questioned him.

312
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,042
And the information you did get,
he is young and poor.

313
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,161
He is born free.

314
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,481
Why should he want to bring back slavery?
What did it do for him?

315
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,925
Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride

316
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,849
was knowing that
there was someone lower than he was.

317
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,967
They pay him.

318
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,123
Great families afraid to do a thing.

319
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,931
They pay poor men to do it for them.

320
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,843
- And how do you know this?
- Everyone know this.

321
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,968
I don't know it,
and I'm the head of a great family.

322
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,361
We do not know
what this man did or didn't do.

323
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,001
Give him a trial at least. A fair trial.

324
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,285
Show all the citizens of Meereen

325
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,761
that you're better than
those who would depose you.

326
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,921
Teach them a better way.

327
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,447
I do not know the place
from where Old Ser comes.

328
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,923
Things maybe are different there, I hope.

329
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,002
But here in Meereen,

330
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,004
before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us.

331
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,401
So we learn much about them,

332
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,608
or we do not live long.

333
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,808
They teach me what they are.

334
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,125
Mercy, fair trial, these
mean nothing to them.

335
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,441
All they understand is blood.

336
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,762
Thank you all for your counsel.

337
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,721
Your Grace, a word, please, I beg you.

338
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,491
- About what?
- About your father.

339
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,528
- About the Mad King.
- The Mad King?

340
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,125
You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies?

341
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,486
Consider me reminded.

342
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,449
Your Grace,

343
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,000
I served in his Kingsguard.

344
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,605
I was at his side from the first.

345
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,122
Your enemies did not lie.

346
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,251
Go on.

347
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,805
When the people rose in revolt against him,

348
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,407
your father set their
towns and castles aflame.

349
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,802
He murdered sons in front of their fathers.

350
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,201
He burned men alive with wildfire

351
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,009
and laughed as they screamed.

352
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,642
And his efforts to stamp out dissent

353
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,044
led to rebellion
that killed every Targaryen except two.

354
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,685
I'm not my father.

355
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,525
No, Your Grace. Thank the gods.

356
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,530
But the Mad King gave his enemies
the justice he thought they deserved.

357
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,400
And each time,
it made him feel powerful and right.

358
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,051
Until the very end.

359
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,880
I will not have the Son of the Harpy
executed without a fair trial.

360
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,482
Your Grace.

361
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,046
There's a bug.

362
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,610
Yes, best be careful.

363
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,490
You might accidentally
consume some solid food.

364
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:21,361
When I agreed to come with you,
did I misrepresent my intentions?

365
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,766
Besides,

366
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,482
what else is there for me to do
inside this fucking box?

367
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,607
You don't like it?

368
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,728
- I want to take a walk.
- You can't.

369
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,447
Cersei has offered a lordship
to the man who brings her your head.

370
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,488
She ought to offer her cunt.

371
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,767
Best part of her for the best part of me.

372
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,491
Well, I suppose a box
is as good a place for me as anywhere.

373
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,206
Are we really going to
spend the entire road to Volantis

374
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,282
talking about the futility of everything?

375
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,566
You're right. No point.

376
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,483
The road to Volantis?

377
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,530
You said we were going to Meereen.
What's in Volantis?

378
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,011
The road to Meereen.

379
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,562
And what do you hope to find
at the end of the road to Meereen?

380
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,842
I told you. A ruler.

381
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,206
We've already got a ruler.

382
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,731
Everywhere has already got a ruler.

383
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:15,124
Every pile of shit on the side of every road
has someones banner hanging from it.

384
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,451
You were quite good, you know, at ruling.

385
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,484
During your brief tenure as Hand.

386
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,085
I didn't rule. I was a servant.

387
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,527
Still, a man of talent.

388
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,085
Managed to kill a lot of people.

389
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,131
Yes, but you showed great promise
in other areas as well.

390
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,410
She wanted me to leave King's Landing.

391
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,609
She begged me.

392
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,841
I wouldn't go.

393
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,481
Why?

394
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,050
'Cause I liked it.

395
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,729
Power.

396
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,882
Even as a servant.

397
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,042
People follow leaders.

398
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,521
And they will never follow us.
They find us repulsive.

399
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,926
I find us repulsive.

400
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,923
And we find them repulsive,

401
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,288
which is why we surround ourselves
with large, comfortable boxes

402
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,486
to keep them away.

403
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,488
And yet,

404
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,767
no matter what we do,

405
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,243
people like you and me
are never really satisfied inside the box.

406
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,924
Not for long.

407
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,929
You're right.

408
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,321
- Let's go for a walk.
- No.

409
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,609
How many dwarves are there in the world?

410
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,365
Is Cersei going to kill them all?

411
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,845
Not him.

412
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,849
Are you trying to deceive your queen?

413
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,601
Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?

414
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,806
That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn.

415
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,210
I don't want to dissuade the other hunters.

416
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,805
Mistakes will be made.

417
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,609
- Thank you, Your Grace.
- Thank you, Your Grace.

418
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,324
- Take the head.
- Pardon me, Your Grace.

419
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,402
I would take it, if you don't mind.

420
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,721
It could prove useful for my work.

421
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,761
Very good.

422
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,248
Over there will be fine.

423
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,560
You heard the man. Over there.

424
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,725
You're the Hand of the King?

425
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,290
No, Uncle.

426
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,046
Clearly it would not be appropriate
for a woman to assume that role.

427
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,168
I'm merely advising my son
until he comes of age

428
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,844
and chooses a Hand for himself.

429
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,364
Your Grace,
I would be willing to serve provisionally

430
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,602
as the King's Hand
until he becomes old enough...

431
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,125
You're a good man, Lord Tyrell,

432
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,605
but I don't imagine you'll have the time.

433
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,527
In addition to being Master of Ships,

434
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,331
the king has appointed you Master of Coin.

435
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,967
Oh, Your Grace.

436
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,442
He called your experience and wisdom
in financial matters unparalleled.

437
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,211
He said he would be honored to have you
represent the crown's interests in the same.

438
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,282
The honor is all mine, Your Grace.

439
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,643
Your Grace, in the past on several occasions,

440
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,246
a grand maester has served
as the King's Hand.

441
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,120
The king has named Qyburn
the new Master of Whisperers.

442
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,731
Your Grace, him? This man?

443
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,009
This embarrassment to the Citadel?

444
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:32,086
Your Grace, what qualifications
can he possibly have for this post?

445
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,282
The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester.

446
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,888
That's far more than the eunuch ever had.

447
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,482
Far more than many ever have.

448
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,323
I must say, I cannot see...

449
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,724
Uncle Kevan, in light of your position
as commander of the Lannister armies,

450
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,322
it would please the king
if you would serve as his Master of War.

451
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,563
No man living better deserves the title.

452
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,842
That is kind of you to say.

453
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,207
I would like to hear it
from the king himself.

454
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,566
The king is very busy at this moment.

455
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,081
He should be here
learning what it means to rule.

456
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,605
He is learning.

457
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,368
On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler,
he's asked me to speak on his behalf.

458
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,127
I returned to the capital
to pay my respects to my brother.

459
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,289
And to you. And to serve the king.

460
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,250
I did not return to serve as your puppet.

461
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,646
To watch you stack the Small Council
with sycophants.

462
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,771
Sending your own brother away
so he wouldn't be...

463
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,610
My brother has left the capital to

464
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,923
lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.

465
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,001
What mission?

466
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,845
That is not your concern as Master of War.

467
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,566
I do not recognize your authority
to dictate what is and is not my concern.

468
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,169
You are the Queen Mother, nothing more.

469
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,611
You would abandon your king
in his time of need?

470
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,963
If he wants to send for me,
I will be waiting for him.

471
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,043
At Casterly Rock.

472
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,120
Come on, you know this one.

473
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,529
It looks like an animal.

474
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,043
Snake.

475
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,208
Snake.S.

476
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,926
- It's an S.
- Right, very good.

477
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,041
Huh!

478
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,049
Did you know that the youngest
Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark,

479
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,690
was elected at the age of 10?

480
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,603
I know S.

481
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,330
You'll learn, I promise.

482
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,483
I taught Ser Davos, and old people
are terrible at learning new things.

483
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,688
Well, you're a wonderful teacher.

484
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,406
Very patient.

485
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,290
I only said that the more time
that you spend practicing,

486
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,566
the faster you'll be able to read.

487
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,450
That's all right. We're doing just fine.

488
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,481
I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark
have a lot to talk about.

489
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,247
How old were you
when you learned how to read?

490
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,810
- Three.
- Three?

491
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,291
Who taught you, your mother?

492
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,124
No, old Maester Cressen did.

493
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,690
I had a lot of time to practice.

494
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,922
My mother kept me inside because...

495
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,411
What do you call it in the south,
what happened to your face?

496
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,403
Greyscale.

497
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,289
What do you call it north of the Wall?

498
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,769
I don't know.

499
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,890
But two of my sisters had it.

500
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,724
They both died.

501
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,961
How did they cure you?

502
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,091
I don't remember. I was a baby.

503
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,242
Lots of people came and tried, I think.

504
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,488
Whatever they did, it went away.

505
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,005
What happened to your sisters?

506
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:42,161
My father made them move out of the keep
into the hut outside.

507
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,447
None of us were allowed to go near them.

508
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,007
But we heard them, especially at night.

509
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,727
They started to sound not like themselves.

510
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,206
Did you ever see them?

511
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,727
Only once at the end.

512
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,525
They were covered with it.

513
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,049
Their faces, their arms.

514
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,811
They acted like animals.

515
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,529
My father had to drag them
out to the woods on a rope.

516
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,008
What did he do with them in the woods?

517
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,882
- Mother.
- Leave us.

518
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,807
Your Grace.

519
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,290
You need to stay away from that girl.

520
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,725
- Why?
- She's a wildling.

521
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,963
Her name is Gilly. She's nice.
I'm teaching her to read.

522
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,362
She's a wildling.
Your father defeated her people.

523
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,205
He executed their king for treason.

524
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,124
They could strike at him by striking at you.

525
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,089
Gilly wouldn't do that.

526
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,847
You have no idea what people will do.

527
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,927
All your books and you still don't know.

528
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,726
I ordered Mance Rayder
burned at the stake.

529
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,041
You prevented that order
from being carried out.

530
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,441
You showed mercy to Mance Rayder.

531
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,121
A king's word is law.

532
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,125
Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos
how much mercy I show to lawbreakers.

533
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,882
Show too much kindness,
people won't fear you.

534
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,883
If they don't fear you,
they don't follow you.

535
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,801
With respect, Your Grace,

536
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,362
the free folk will never follow you
no matter what you do.

537
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,330
You're the man who burned their king alive.

538
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,685
Who, then?

539
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,281
You?

540
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,405
No.

541
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,968
Only one of their own.

542
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,288
Do you know this wretched girl,

543
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,367
Lyanna Mormont?

544
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,369
The Lord Commander's niece.

545
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,887
Lady of Bear Island and a child of 10.

546
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,523
I asked her to commit her house to my cause.
That's her response.

547
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,604
"Bear Island knows no king
but the King in the North,

548
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,887
"whose name is Stark."

549
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,684
That amuses you?

550
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,642
I apologize, Your Grace.

551
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,808
Northerners can be a bit like the free folk.

552
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,644
Loyal to their own.

553
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,841
I know.

554
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,363
My brother, Robert, went on often and loudly
about how difficult it was to control them.

555
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,682
Even with your father's help.

556
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,405
Tonight, the Night's Watch
elects a new Lord Commander.

557
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,209
Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win.

558
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,806
- Most likely.
- Unpleasant man.

559
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,451
He thinks you're a traitor.

560
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,410
What's your life going to be like here
at the Wall with Thorne in command?

561
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,891
Unpleasant, I expect.

562
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,008
Your bravery made him look weak.

563
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,844
He'll punish you for it.

564
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,649
I don't punish men for bravery.

565
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,644
I reward them.

566
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,848
I don't doubt it, Your Grace.

567
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,768
But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.

568
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,968
I pledged them my life, my honor, my sword.

569
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,210
I don't know what I have left to give you.

570
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,847
You can give me the North.

571
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,370
I can't.

572
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,047
Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard, a Snow.

573
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,326
Kneel before me. Lay your sword at my feet.

574
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,529
Pledge me your service
and you'll rise again as Jon Stark,

575
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,443
Lord of Winterfell.

576
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,491
He'll make you a Stark
with the stroke of a pen?

577
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,131
It's the first thing I ever remember wanting.

578
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,884
I'd daydream that my father
would ask the king

579
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,248
and just like that, I would never be
the Bastard of Winterfell again.

580
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,607
You deserve this. You do.

581
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,331
I couldn't be happier for you.

582
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,607
I'm going to refuse him.

583
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,086
But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.

584
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,481
I swore a vow to the Night's Watch.

585
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,281
If I don't take my own word seriously,
what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?

586
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,808
Crowded. You'd think
we were serving venison stew.

587
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,288
Does anyone wish to speak for candidates

588
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,205
before we cast our tokens

589
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:23,003
for the 998th Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch?

590
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,843
Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight,
he's a man of true nobility.

591
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,364
He was acting commander
when the Wall came under attack

592
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,204
and led us to victory against the wildlings.

593
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,281
Hear, hear.

594
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,691
He's a veteran of 100 battles

595
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,969
and has been a defender of the Watch
and the Wall almost all of his life.

596
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,485
Aye.

597
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,131
He's the only true choice.

598
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,281
Yes!

599
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,247
Ser Denys Mallister joined the Watch as a boy

600
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,690
and has served loyally,
longer than any other ranger.

601
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,449
Through 10 winters he served.

602
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,002
As commander of the Shadow Tower,
he kept the wildlings away.

603
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,721
We could do no better.

604
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,842
If there is no one else,
we will begin the voting.

605
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,326
The triangular tokens
count for Ser Alliser Thorne.

606
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,321
The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister.

607
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,165
- Each brother will...
- Maester Aemon.

608
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,849
Samwell Tarly. Go on.

609
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,648
Sam the Slayer.

610
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,445
Another wildling lover
just like his friend Jon Snow.

611
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,161
How's your lady love, Slayer?

612
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,208
Her name is Gilly.

613
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,170
Brother Slynt knows her quite well.

614
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,490
They cowered together in the larder
during the battle for the Wall.

615
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,608
Lies!

616
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,890
A wildling girl, a baby, and Lord Janos.

617
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:54,049
I found him there after the battle was over
in a puddle of his own making.

618
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:03,607
Whilst Lord Janos was hiding
with the women and children,

619
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,727
Jon Snow was leading.

620
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,362
Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true.

621
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,171
And when he was wounded,
it was Jon who saved us.

622
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,889
He took charge of the Wall's defense.
He killed the Magnar of the Thenns.

623
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,207
He went north to deal with Mance Rayder

624
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,250
knowing it almost certainly
meant his own death.

625
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,131
Before that,

626
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,642
he led the mission to
avenge Lord Commander Mormont.

627
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,050
Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward.

628
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,681
He saw something in Jon
and now we've all seen it, too.

629
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,084
He may be young.

630
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,288
But he's the commander we turned to
when the night was darkest.

631
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,649
I can't argue with any of that.

632
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,127
But who does Jon Snow want to command?

633
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,205
Night's Watch,

634
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,285
or the wildlings?

635
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,322
Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl,

636
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,323
he spoke with Mance Rayder many times.

637
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,166
What would have happened in that tent
between those two old friends

638
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,322
if Stannis' army hadn't come along?

639
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,968
We all saw him put the King-beyond-the-Wall
out of his misery.

640
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,962
Do you want to choose a man
who has fought the wildlings all his life,

641
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,204
or a man who makes love to them?

642
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,811
It is time.

643
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,769
It appears to be a tie, Maester.

644
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,603
Jon Snow!
Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow!

645
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,804
You. You.

646
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,761
What have you got there?

647
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,084
- I said...
- Turn around and go.

648
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,091
Turn around and go.

649
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,003
That's a nice little sword.

650
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,367
Worth 100 pigeons, a sword like that.

651
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,642
Nothing's worth anything to dead men.

652
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,451
Come on. Quickly, go! Go!

653
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,211
Who are you?

654
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,285
Why were they scared of you?

655
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,490
You lost this.

656
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,649
You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.

657
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,491
There isn't.

658
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,801
A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.

659
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,009
Well, who are you, then?

660
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,565
No one.

661
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,484
And that is who a girl must become.

662
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,928
She doesn't belong here.

663
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,727
And no matter how many of you traitors
call her "Mhysa",

664
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,289
she will never be your mother.

665
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,211
Why?

666
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,530
For you, Mhysa.

667
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,767
You wanted the Harpy dead,

668
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,082
but your hands were tied.

669
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,245
I set you free, as you did all of us.

670
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,404
He was our prisoner, awaiting trial.

671
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,246
You had no right.

672
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:16,405
He would rather rip your city apart
than see slaves lifted from the dirt.

673
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,120
There are no more slaves.

674
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,761
There are no more Masters.

675
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,082
Then who lives in the pyramids?

676
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,765
Who wears gold masks
and murders your children?

677
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,642
When Grey Worm came to us,

678
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,401
I was the first to take up the knife for you.

679
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,164
I remember the look on my father's face
as I struck down his Master,

680
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,371
who had traded his infant son for a dog.

681
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,686
My father died in the fighting.

682
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,926
If we allow the Sons of the Harpy
to return us to chains,

683
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,727
he never lived.

684
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,651
The Harpy's life was not yours to take.

685
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,766
Once, the Masters were the law-

686
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,251
And now you are the law.

687
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,163
The law is the law.

688
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:23,611
Take him.

689
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,649
Mhysa! Mhysa!

690
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,530
Mhysa! Mhysa!

691
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,205
Mhysa! Mhysa!

692
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,006
Mhysa!

693
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,728
She should have cut off the traitor's head
in the Great Pyramid and been done with it.

694
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,928
Which is what I keep
telling her to do to you.

695
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:15,201
Mhysa! Mhysa!

696
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,368
You opened your gates to me

697
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:23,087
because I promised you freedom and justice.

698
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:30,484
One cannot exist without the other.

699
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,563
- Brother! Brother!

700
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,889
Mhysa, please!

701
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,566
Forgive me.

702
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:07,246
A citizen of Meereen was awaiting
trial and this man murdered him.

703
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,245
The punishment is death.

704
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:17,047
- Mercy, mercy

705
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,801
Mhysa.

706
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,047
Mhysa!

707
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,366
I'll stand guard outside your door tonight,
Your Grace.

708
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,050
We all guard tonight.

709
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,727
Leave me.

710
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,649
Drogon.

711
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:23,500
<b><font color=#0E7521>Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
<b><font color=#0E7521>Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

2
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,844
Valar Morghulis.

3
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,127
Valar Dohaeris.

4
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,530
I've been sweeping this floor for days.

5
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,647
Good.

6
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,609
I didn't come here to sweep floors.

7
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,007
No? Why come, then?

8
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,525
You said I could be your apprentice.

9
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,651
You said you'd teach me
how to be a Faceless Man.

10
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,689
A man teaches a girl.

11
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,890
Valar Dohaeris. All men must serve.

12
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,042
Faceless Men most of all.

13
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,006
I want to serve.

14
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,082
A girl wants to serve herself.

15
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,288
Here we serve the Many-Faced God.

16
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,850
To serve well,

17
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,488
a girl must become no one.

18
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,130
Which one's the Many-Faced God?

19
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,523
I see the Stranger. I see the Drowned God.
I see the weirwood face.

20
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,001
There is only one god.

21
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,241
A girl knows his name.

22
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,967
And all men know his gift.

23
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,602
Where are they taking him?

24
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,643
- Queen Margaery!
- Queen Margaery!

25
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,568
Queen Margaery!

26
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,722
Queen Margaery!

27
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,287
Queen Margaery!

28
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,649
- I am his and he is mine.
- I am hers and she is mine.

29
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,122
From this day until the end of my days.

30
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,850
Did I hurt you?

31
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,327
No. You were lovely.

32
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,643
- It all happened so fast.
- Yes.

33
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,000
I was scared maybe I hurt you.

34
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,085
- It sounded like...
- No, no, no.

35
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,650
You're very sweet.

36
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,005
The sweetest king who ever lived.

37
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,924
This is all I want to do all day,
every day, for the rest of my life.

38
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,680
Wouldn't that be glorious?

39
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,890
Shouldn't we rest a little while?

40
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,770
Just to catch our breath?
There's no rush, is there?

41
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,966
Of course not.

42
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,566
Are you hungry?

43
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,086
Should I have them bring you
some cake or pomegranate juice?

44
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,083
No, I'm fine.

45
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,004
I just want you all to myself.

46
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,849
I want to know everything there is to know
about King Tommen, First of His Name.

47
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,649
King Tommen.

48
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,604
Still sounds strange to me.

49
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,769
Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?

50
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,601
So strange.

51
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,603
- Husband.
- Wife.

52
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,967
Sometimes it feels odd.

53
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,644
I'm the king,

54
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,008
I've married the most
beautiful woman in the world,

55
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,485
and it's all because my brother died.

56
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,003
I understand.

57
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,363
But it's not your fault.
You know that, don't you?

58
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,204
You mustn't feel guilty.

59
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,249
I don't feel guilty.

60
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,565
That's what's odd.

61
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,206
Do you like to sail?

62
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,201
I love to sail.

63
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,522
I do, too.

64
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,571
I think we're going to be very happy,
you and I.

65
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,651
I do, too.

66
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,491
Living in a tower
so high it touches the clouds.

67
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,524
Of course, my grandmother
couldn't wait to go home.

68
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,206
The capital's not for everyone, I suppose.

69
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,408
Does your mother like it here?

70
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,050
I don't think so.

71
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,447
She told me
never to trust anyone in King's Landing.

72
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,923
It's so wonderful
to have her watching over you.

73
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,128
A lioness guarding her cub.

74
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,647
Well, but I'm a man now.

75
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,211
You are.

76
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,285
And the king.

77
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,690
But you'll always be her baby boy.

78
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,205
I suppose.

79
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,960
I adore her. She's always been
so generous with me, so kind.

80
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,088
And the horrors she's had to endure...

81
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,969
Losing her husband,
her eldest child, and her father.

82
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,651
It's no wonder she's so protective of you.

83
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,451
She'll never let you out of her sight.

84
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,928
You look very much in love.

85
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,287
The first days of marriage
are often so blissful.

86
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,130
She's certainly very pretty, isn't she?

87
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,170
Like a doll. She smiles quite a lot.

88
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,082
Do you think she's intelligent?

89
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,564
I can't quite tell.

90
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,760
Not that it matters.

91
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,410
Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?

92
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,608
There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.

93
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,890
That's where you grew up.

94
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,882
You always told me
that you liked the people there better.

95
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,929
You said that King's Landing
smelled of horse dung and sour milk.

96
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,129
Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?

97
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,041
The way that you talked about it,

98
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,407
I always thought that you missed it.

99
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,130
That you...

100
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,201
That it was your real home.

101
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,409
This is my real home now,
where my family lives.

102
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,888
I want you to be happy, Mother.

103
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,565
I know that.

104
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,645
I know you do. My sweet boy.

105
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,802
But wouldn't you be happier
in Casterly Rock?

106
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,928
I said,
"Darling, surely four times is enough.

107
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,889
"Are you trying to set a new record?"

108
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,567
He said, "Well, what is the record?
I'm sure we can break it."

109
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,570
Mother.

110
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,491
Welcome.

111
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,370
Don't you look lovely?
Marriage agrees with you.

112
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,171
Can we bring you anything to eat or drink?

113
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,050
I wish we had some wine for you.
It's a bit early in the day for us.

114
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,001
No, no, I can't stay.

115
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,687
I just wanted to let you know
if there's ever anything I can do for you...

116
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,683
You are very sweet.

117
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,762
Tommen seems quite taken
with his new queen.

118
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,446
I absolutely adore him.

119
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,043
You raised a gallant young man.
I'm forever grateful.

120
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,491
Good.

121
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,246
Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.

122
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,766
Ecstatic. I really am.

123
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,604
Exhausted, to be honest.

124
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,969
But what could I expect?
He is half lion, half stag.

125
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,529
I'll leave you to it, then.

126
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,563
Oh, forgive me.

127
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,160
I haven't been at court for long.
I get so confused.

128
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,402
What's the proper way to address you now?

129
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,841
Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?

130
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,409
There's no need for such formalities.

131
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,962
In any event,
judging from the king's enthusiasm,

132
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,088
the Queen Mother will be
a Queen Grandmother soon.

133
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,764
Won't that be a lovely day?

134
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,890
Can you imagine the celebrations?
They'll ring the bells all day and night.

135
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,644
Remember,

136
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,047
anything you need.

137
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,331
We can't hold the North
with terror alone.

138
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,926
You can't hold the North
if you let these lesser lords insult us.

139
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,651
I sent you there to collect taxes,
not bodies.

140
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,610
Lord Cerwyn refused to pay.

141
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,041
Said the Warden of the North
would always be a Stark,

142
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,691
and he'd be damned
if he'd kiss a traitor's boot.

143
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,482
He left you no choice.

144
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,451
I flayed him living,
along with his wife and brother.

145
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,488
Made his son watch.

146
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,041
And?

147
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,441
The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.

148
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,442
I've something important to tell you.

149
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,761
Stop eating and listen.

150
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,363
We don't have enough men to hold the North
if the other houses rise up against us.

151
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,726
Do you understand that?

152
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,365
Our pact with the Lannisters protects...

153
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,442
I had a pact with Tywin Lannister.

154
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,887
And Tywin Lannister is dead.

155
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,964
The remaining Lannisters are
a thousand miles away dealing with that fact.

156
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,847
They've never once,
in the history of the Seven Kingdoms,

157
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,843
sent their army this far north.

158
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,002
If you think they will for us, you're a fool.

159
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,402
We've become a great house
by entering into alliances with other houses,

160
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,768
and parlaying those alliances
into greater power.

161
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,880
The best way to forge a lasting alliance
isn't by peeling a man's skin off.

162
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,450
The best way is marriage.

163
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,247
Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree,

164
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,051
it's high time you married a suitable bride.

165
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,164
And as it happens,

166
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,483
I've found the perfect girl
to solidify our hold on the North.

167
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,125
That's Moat Cailin.

168
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,647
Yes, a bit shabby, isn't it?

169
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,961
You've been here before?

170
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,045
On our way down to King's Landing
with my father and Arya.

171
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,041
Where are you taking me?

172
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,645
Home.

173
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,244
The Boltons have Winterfell.

174
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,281
Your marriage proposal, it wasn't for you.

175
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,641
No.

176
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,324
Roose Bolton murdered my brother.
He betrayed my family.

177
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,925
He did.

178
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,889
He serves the Lannisters.

179
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,325
For now.

180
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,687
- I won't go.
- Winterfell is your home.

181
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,240
- Not anymore.
- Always.

182
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,324
You're a Stark.
Dying your hair doesn't change that.

183
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,247
You're Sansa Stark, eldest surviving child
of Ned and Catelyn Stark.

184
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,651
Your place is in the North.

185
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,884
I can't marry him. You can't make me.
He is a traitor. A murderer!

186
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,928
You're not marrying Roose Bolton.

187
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,447
No, you'll be marrying
his son and heir, Ramsay.

188
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,369
One day he'll be Warden of the North
and you...

189
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,726
- No.
- Sansa.

190
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,522
No, you can't make me. I will starve myself.
I will die before I have to go there.

191
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,888
I won't force you to do anything.

192
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,566
Don't you know by now
how much I care for you?

193
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,966
Say the word and we turn the horses around,
but listen to me.

194
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,644
Listen.

195
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,809
You've been running all your life.

196
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,851
Terrible things happen to your family
and you weep.

197
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,049
You sit alone in a darkened room
mourning their fates.

198
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,523
You've been a bystander to tragedy
from the day they executed your father.

199
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,171
Stop being a bystander. Do you hear me?

200
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,446
Stop running.

201
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,961
There's no justice in the world.

202
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,249
Not unless we make it.

203
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,724
You loved your family.

204
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,487
Avenge them.

205
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,885
Banners!

206
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,770
How do we get through there?

207
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,006
We don't.

208
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,970
We go around.

209
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,520
Takes us miles out of the way.

210
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,840
We'll lose sight of them.

211
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,969
Doesn't matter.
I know where they're going.

212
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,281
Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire?

213
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,568
How did you end up squiring for the Imp?

214
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,447
He hates that nickname.

215
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,887
Well, he's not here to complain about it,
is he?

216
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,241
I squired for a knight named Ser Lorimer
during the War of the Five Kings.

217
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,483
One night, he had a bit too much to drink,

218
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,166
and he was famished, so he borrowed a ham.

219
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,321
He borrowed it?

220
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,686
He wasn't a thief.

221
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,041
He was drunk, and hungry,
and he wasn't thinking.

222
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,368
I was drunk, too.

223
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,487
He gave me half the ham.

224
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,646
Next morning,
one of the guards saw him passed out

225
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,691
under a wagon
with the hambone still in his hand.

226
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,729
They hanged him that afternoon.

227
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,280
They tied the noose for me, too,

228
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,405
but Lord Tywin heard
my family name was Payne,

229
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,766
so he pardoned me,

230
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,320
and sent me to King's Landing
to squire for his son.

231
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,722
As punishment for both of you.

232
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,689
It didn't seem that way.

233
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,524
Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.

234
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,921
Yes, all your lords have
been very kind to you.

235
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,684
All except me.

236
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,127
Sorry, you had to squire
for such a nasty person.

237
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,282
I'm not sorry.
You're the best fighter I've ever seen.

238
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,845
You beat the Hound.

239
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,002
I'm proud to be your squire.

240
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,281
I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.

241
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,681
If you didn't snap at me,
I wouldn't learn anything.

242
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,561
You want to be a knight, Pod?

243
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,721
Yes.

244
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,565
Starting tomorrow,
we'll train with the sword twice a day,

245
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,246
before we ride in the morning
and after you make camp in the evening.

246
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,044
And I'm going to show you
how to ride properly.

247
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,121
Thank you.

248
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,601
I can't knight you,
but I can teach you how to fight.

249
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,523
I suppose that's more important.

250
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,202
You weren't a knight,

251
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,045
but you were a Kingsguard
to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?

252
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,605
I was.

253
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,001
Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.

254
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,520
He was.

255
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,804
How did you end up serving Renly?

256
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,211
When I was a girl, my father held a ball.

257
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,966
I'm his only living child,
so he wanted to make a good match for me.

258
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,611
He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth.

259
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,490
I didn't want to go,
but he dragged me to the ballroom.

260
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,643
And it was wonderful.

261
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,601
None of the boys noticed
how mulish and tall I was.

262
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,648
They shoved each other
and threatened to duel

263
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,007
when they thought it was their turn to dance.

264
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,449
They whispered in my ear

265
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,161
how they wanted to marry me
and take me back to their castles.

266
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,523
My father smiled at me, and I smiled at him.

267
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,287
I had never been so happy.

268
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,881
Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering.

269
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,365
And then they all started to laugh.

270
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,489
They couldn't keep
the game going any longer.

271
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,244
They were toying with me.

272
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,281
"Brienne the Beauty," they called me.
Great joke.

273
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,527
And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive.

274
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,450
A great lumbering beast.

275
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,766
I tried to run away,
but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms.

276
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,450
"Don't let them see your tears," he told me.

277
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,363
"They're nasty little shits,

278
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,330
"and nasty little shits
aren't worth crying over."

279
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,887
He danced with me,
and none of the other boys could say a word.

280
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,128
Renly was the king's brother after all.

281
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,404
But wasn't he...

282
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,244
Lord Tyrion said he was...

283
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,123
Yes, Pod, he liked men. I'm not an idiot.

284
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,889
He didn't love me. He didn't want me.

285
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,681
He danced with me because he was kind,
and didn't want to see me hurt.

286
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,644
He saved me from being a joke.

287
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,281
From that day until his last day.

288
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,247
And I couldn't save him in return.

289
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,401
Nothing's more hateful
than failing to protect the one you love.

290
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,682
One day I will avenge King Renly.

291
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,607
But you said a shadow murdered him.

292
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,727
How do you fight a shadow?

293
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,287
A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon.

294
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,646
I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart.

295
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,842
Stannis is a man, not a shadow.

296
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,526
And a man can be killed.

297
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,441
- Lord Commander.
- Your Grace.

298
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,363
I'd like to speak alone.

299
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,681
Olly is my steward now,

300
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,047
as I was Lord Commander Mormont's.

301
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,526
I want him to attend my meetings
to learn from men with experience.

302
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,728
One day he might command.

303
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,361
Very well.

304
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,608
Have you considered my offer?

305
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,286
I have.

306
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,448
And I thank you for it.
You do me great honor.

307
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,961
All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.

308
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,605
Say the word and you will be.

309
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,330
But I have to refuse you.

310
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,406
I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

311
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,131
My place is here.

312
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,090
I'm giving you the chance
to avenge your family,

313
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,691
to take back the castle where you grew up.

314
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,842
To rule the North.

315
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,241
I wish I could fight beside you.

316
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,209
Believe me, I do.

317
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,409
But I swore a sacred vow at the godswood.

318
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,610
I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.

319
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,603
You're as stubborn as your father.

320
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,601
And as honorable.

321
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,845
I can imagine no higher praise.

322
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,081
I didn't mean it as praise.

323
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,564
Honor got your father killed.

324
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,443
But if your mind's made up,
I won't try and dissuade you.

325
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,842
May I ask how long you plan
to stay at Castle Black?

326
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,490
Are you bored of us already?

327
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,442
You saved us from Mance Rayder's army.
We will never forget that.

328
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,690
But it's a question of survival.

329
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,411
The Night's Watch can't continue
to feed your men

330
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,211
and the wildling prisoners indefinitely.

331
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,361
Winter is coming.

332
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,645
I know it.

333
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,930
We march on Winterfell within the fortnight,
before the snows trap us here.

334
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,366
And the wildlings?

335
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,642
If they'd rather burn than fight for me,
so be it.

336
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,960
I leave their fate to you.

337
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,044
You could execute them.
That's the safest course.

338
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,129
Or you could see if this Tormund fellow

339
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,851
is more willing to compromise
than Mance ever was.

340
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,288
I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch
would rather see the wildlings dead.

341
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,249
Most of the brothers, yes.

342
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,961
There's little love for the free folk here.

343
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,647
You're the Lord Commander. Your decision.

344
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,764
You have many enemies in Castle Black.

345
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,844
Have you considered
sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere?

346
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,806
Give him command of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

347
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,247
I heard it was best
to keep your enemies close.

348
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,641
Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.

349
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,330
He sees something in you.

350
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,851
Might not be apparent from his tone,
but it's the truth.

351
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,206
He believes in you.

352
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,448
I'm sorry I disappointed him.

353
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,688
The king is a complicated man,

354
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,281
but he wants to do what's right
for the Seven Kingdoms.

355
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,725
As long as he's ruling them.

356
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,529
He's the one true king.

357
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,169
He has a blood right to that throne.

358
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,926
I've sworn to stay clear of the politics
of the Seven Kingdoms.

359
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,240
Have you now?

360
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,887
How does the Night's Watch vow go again?

361
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,926
I'll bet you've got it memorized
since you got here.

362
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,648
Night gathers and now my watch begins.

363
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,644
No, not that bit. The bit at the end.

364
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,801
I am the sword in the darkness,

365
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,644
the watcher on the walls,

366
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,563
the shield that guards the realms of men.

367
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,649
- I pledge my life...
- Right, that's enough.

368
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,121
The shield that guards the realms of men.

369
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,241
That's what you swore to be.

370
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,325
Now, I'm not a learned man,

371
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,686
but the best way to help the most people

372
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,923
might not be sitting in a frozen castle
at the edge of the world.

373
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,926
It just might mean wading in the muck,
getting your boots dirty,

374
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,968
and doing what needs to be done.

375
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,371
And what needs to be done?

376
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,286
As long as the Boltons rule the North,
the North will suffer.

377
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,290
Just one man's opinion.

378
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,961
What do you want?

379
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,924
Who are you?

380
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,241
What?

381
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,723
You, who walk in here
with a coin you never earned,

382
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,802
whose value you do not respect.

383
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,361
Who are you?

384
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,001
No one.

385
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,721
Ow!

386
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,847
- Cunt!
- A lie.

387
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,163
A sad little lie. Who are you?

388
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,321
I told you, I'm...

389
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,286
Do that again, and...

390
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,925
Who are you?

391
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,084
You're about to find out.

392
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,209
What are you doing?

393
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,965
We were only playing. The Game of Faces.

394
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,162
- A girl is not ready.
- Clearly not.

395
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,641
I am ready.

396
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,727
For what?

397
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,406
For whatever you want.

398
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,171
To be a Faceless Man. To be no one.

399
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,249
Whose sword is that?

400
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,765
It belongs to Arya Stark.

401
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,970
Arya Stark's sword, clothes, stolen silver.

402
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,247
A man wonders,

403
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,531
how is it that no one came to be
surrounded by Arya Stark's things?

404
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,726
What do we do with them after we wash them?

405
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,846
Open gate!

406
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,167
Honor guard, stand to!

407
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,001
Hold up. Easy.

408
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,651
Lady Sansa. Welcome.

409
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,771
Lord Bolton.

410
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,121
May I introduce my son, Ramsay Bolton?

411
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,367
It's an honor to meet you, my lady.

412
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,491
I'll bring you a bowl of hot water.
You must want to wash.

413
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,925
Thank you.

414
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,520
Welcome home, Lady Stark.

415
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,248
The North remembers.

416
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,967
Sam?

417
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,405
Maester Aemon?

418
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,608
He apologizes for not being here.

419
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,930
He's not feeling well.

420
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,206
Take good care of him.

421
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,765
Brothers.

422
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,725
As you all know too well,
it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit.

423
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,923
First Builder Yarvvyck and I
have decided to appoint a latrine captain

424
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,843
to oversee this crucial task.

425
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,085
Brian.

426
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,607
Seems like a good job for a ginger.

427
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,128
- That's him!
- That's him.

428
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,761
Ser Alliser.

429
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,648
You have more experience
than any other ranger at Castle Black.

430
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,087
You proved your valor many times over

431
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,288
while defending the Wall
from the wildling attack.

432
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,443
I name you First Ranger.

433
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,646
Hear, hear!

434
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,768
Lord Janos.
I'm giving you command of Greyguard.

435
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,680
Greyguard is a ruin.

436
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,805
Yes, the fort is in a sorry state.
Restore it as best you can.

437
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,689
First Builder Yarvvyck can spare 10 of his...

438
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,364
I was charged
with the defense of King's Landing

439
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,408
when you were soiling
your swaddling clothes.

440
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,686
Keep your ruin.

441
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,921
All right! That's enough of that.

442
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,684
You mistake me, my lord.

443
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,562
That was a command, not an offer.

444
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,848
Pack your arms and armor,
say your farewells,

445
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,402
and ride for Greyguard.

446
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,570
I will not go meekly off to freeze and die.

447
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,690
Give it to one of the fools
who cast a stone for you.

448
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,129
I will not have it. Did you hear me, boy?
I will not have it!

449
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,726
Are you refusing to obey my order?

450
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,723
You can stick your order up your bastard ass.

451
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,406
Take Lord Janos outside.

452
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,480
Olly, bring me my sword.

453
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,081
- Get out.
- You cannot do this!

454
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,645
Get your hands off me! Scum, all of you!

455
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,604
If the boy thinks he can frighten me,
he's mistaken.

456
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,920
Yes, very mistaken.

457
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,684
Disgrace!

458
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,161
I have friends.
Important friends in the capital.

459
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,691
- You'll see.
- Kneel!

460
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,883
If you have any last words, my lord,
now's the time.

461
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,409
I was wrong. You're the Lord Commander.
We all serve you. I'm sorry.

462
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,689
Not only for this,
for all I've done and said.

463
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,725
I was wrong.

464
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,082
My lord, please! Mercy! Mercy!

465
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,804
I'll go! I will!

466
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,481
Please.

467
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,446
I'm afraid.

468
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,607
I've always been afraid.

469
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,449
You have served us well, my son.

470
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,886
Thank you, Father.

471
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,006
Which of the Seven will you worship today?

472
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,127
The Maiden.

473
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,881
Always the Maiden.

474
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,170
<i>And the Stranger.</i>

475
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,444
- Two is extra, you realize?
- Yes, yes.

476
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,167
What are you doing?

477
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,886
This establishment belongs
to Lord Petyr Baelish. You can't...

478
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,003
You have profaned our faith,

479
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,124
the faith of our fathers and forefathers.

480
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,282
I am the High Septon of the...

481
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,522
You are a sinner.

482
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,443
And you shall be punished.

483
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,041
Ah!

484
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,288
- Sinner.
- Sinner.

485
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,044
- Sinner. Sinner.
- Repent!

486
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,326
Sinner.

487
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,370
Sinner.

488
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,807
Sinner. Sinner.

489
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,087
- Shame on you.
- Sinner.

490
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,644
Your Grace, Grand Maester, Lord Tyrell...

491
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,321
Uh...

492
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,045
It doesn't matter.

493
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,247
As the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven,

494
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:43,247
I give voice to the will of the gods
and am their foremost servant in this world.

495
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,290
An insult to me is an insult to the gods.

496
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,530
An assault on my person
is an assault on our very religion.

497
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,170
- You were assaulted?
- I was.

498
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,687
By those fanatics
who call themselves Sparrows.

499
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,924
They humiliated me, they beat me,

500
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,004
they left me naked and bleeding
on the cobblestones.

501
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,650
I am lucky to be alive.

502
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,690
I heard this assault
began in Littlefinger's brothel.

503
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,651
This is a rather shocking thing to hear.

504
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,451
I tend to both the highest born
and the lowliest amongst us.

505
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,761
Even prostitutes
may earn the mercy of the Mother.

506
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:17,606
So, you were ministering
to the needs of these devout prostitutes?

507
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,729
A man's private affairs
ought to stay private.

508
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,209
What do you want from us, High Septon?

509
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,805
Justice.

510
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,120
I ask that you protect our faith

511
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,046
by arresting these criminals
and throwing them in the Black Cells.

512
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:34,920
I ask that you execute their leader,
this so-called High Sparrow.

513
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,288
He's a threat to everything we hold sacred.
If he goes unpunished...

514
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,964
And where do I find this man?

515
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,803
This High Sparrow?

516
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,963
I don't think this is a good idea.

517
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,169
Nonsense, Ser Meryn.
These are deeply religious people.

518
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,567
Where can I find the High Sparrow?

519
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,443
Seven blessings.

520
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,407
- Thank you.
- Just a little more.

521
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,091
Thank you.

522
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,881
Thank you.

523
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,401
A young man said I'd find
the High Sparrow back here.

524
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,484
- Where is he?
- High Sparrow?

525
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,971
Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?

526
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,762
Like Lord Duckling or King Turtle.

527
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,604
Still, it's meant to.

528
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,684
We're often stuck with the names
our enemies give to us.

529
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,208
The notion that we're all equal
in the eyes of the Seven

530
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,602
doesn't sit well with some,
so they belittle me.

531
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,886
Seven blessings to you.

532
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,122
Seven blessings to you, my dear.

533
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,527
It's only a name.
Quite an easy burden to bear.

534
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,523
Far easier than hers.

535
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,641
Why no shoes?

536
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,128
Because I gave them away
to someone who needed them more.

537
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,201
We all do that.

538
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,922
It stops us from forgetting
what we really are.

539
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,731
Is that why you came to King's Landing?

540
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,245
To remind everyone?

541
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,608
Everyone? Hard enough job
reminding myself.

542
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:24,049
Well, I tell them no one's special,
and they think I'm special for telling them so.

543
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,801
Perhaps they're right.

544
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,164
It would be comforting to believe that,
wouldn't it?

545
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,686
Have the gods sent you here to tempt me?

546
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,525
I hope not.

547
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,611
I had assumed
you'd only come here to arrest me

548
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,523
for that incident with the High Septon.

549
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,886
An unacceptable way
to treat the chosen representative

550
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,611
of the gods in this world, wouldn't you say?

551
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,047
Hypocrisy is a boil.

552
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,647
Lancing a boil is never pleasant.

553
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,121
Although they could have been
more careful with the blade.

554
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,610
The High Septon came to speak to me today.

555
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,606
He doesn't want me to arrest you.
He wants me to execute you.

556
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,729
I wouldn't presume
to know your thoughts on the matter.

557
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,722
My thoughts on the matter
are in line with your own.

558
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,246
The High Septon's behavior was corrosive,
as was his attitude.

559
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:28,365
Having a man like that reside in the sept
eats away at the faith from the inside.

560
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,803
So now he resides
in the Red Keep dungeons instead.

561
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,962
The faith and the crown are the two pillars
that hold up this world.

562
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,122
One collapses, so does the other.

563
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,770
We must do everything necessary
to protect one another.

564
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,647
Your Grace.

565
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,366
Send a raven with this message
to Littlefinger at the Eyrie,

566
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,647
or wherever he's slithering about.

567
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,205
At once, Your Grace.

568
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,686
How's your work coming along?

569
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,205
Very well.

570
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,884
You've made progress?

571
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,530
More than I expected.

572
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,246
- Still a way to go, but...
- Very good.

573
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,930
I'll leave you to it, then.

574
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,289
Make sure Littlefinger is clear
on the meaning of the word "immediately."

575
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,931
Shh.

576
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,643
Easy, friend.

577
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,963
She really is lovely.

578
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,809
I hope I can make her happy.

579
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,928
I hope so, too.

580
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,925
I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa
during our travels together.

581
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,241
She's suffered enough.

582
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,847
I'll never hurt her. You have my word.

583
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,049
I've heard very little about you,

584
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,049
which makes you quite a rare thing
as lords go.

585
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,765
I haven't been a lord very long.

586
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,365
I was a bastard.

587
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,044
And you're not anymore.

588
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,727
Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.

589
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,040
Yes, Father.

590
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,804
And thank you, Lord Baelish.

591
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,244
I'm forever in your debt.

592
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,123
He seems pleased.

593
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,201
Shouldn't he be?

594
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,530
I assure you, she's still a virgin.

595
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,727
Tyrion never consummated the marriage.
By the law of the land, she is no man's wife.

596
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,040
Inspect her, if you must.

597
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,841
I'll leave that to the brothel keeper.
It's her name I need, not her virtue.

598
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,242
Then I have delivered everything I promised.

599
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,007
And you're prepared for the consequences

600
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,651
when the Lannisters hear
I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay?

601
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,371
The Lannister name
doesn't mean what it once did.

602
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,930
Tywin is dead.

603
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,890
He kept his house in power
through sheer will.

604
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,282
Without him,
Jaime has one hand and no allies.

605
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:45,129
Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear.

606
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,565
The queen will be enraged.

607
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,603
Queen Margaery adores Sansa.

608
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,729
Cersei is Queen Mother,

609
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,491
a title whose importance
wanes with each passing day.

610
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,324
And yet she still has friends,

611
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,961
men in important places
whom she can ask for favors.

612
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,044
A message for you from Cersei Lannister.

613
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:07,167
A rider arrived from the Eyrie
shortly before dawn.

614
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,924
Apparently she thinks
you're still in the Vale.

615
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,842
A message for me, you say?

616
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,766
Strange that the seal is broken.

617
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,607
I'm sure you understand my position,
Lord Baelish.

618
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,722
If you receive word in the night
from the Queen Mother,

619
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,286
it does make me question our new alliance.

620
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,771
The Lannisters made you
one of the great lords of Westeros,

621
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,091
yet here you are in the North
undermining them.

622
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,170
Why gamble with your position?

623
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,008
Every ambitious move is a gamble.

624
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,611
You gambled when you drove a dagger
into Robb Stark's heart.

625
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,089
It appears that your gamble paid off.

626
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,885
You're Warden of the North.

627
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,962
I had Tywin Lannister's backing.

628
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,168
Who supports me now? You?

629
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,763
The Eyrie is mine.

630
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:56,723
The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed
an alliance with the lords of the North,

631
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,009
they brought down the greatest dynasty
this world has ever known.

632
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,322
I'd like to borrow one of your birds.

633
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,609
Cersei will expect a reply.

634
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,049
I'd like to read the reply.

635
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,729
I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

636
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,165
Volantis is a large city.

637
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,444
I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

638
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:42,525
The likelihood of you being spotted here
increases a hundredfold.

639
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,011
Mmm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

640
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,807
I'm not sure how many new ways
I can find of saying this.

641
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:56,324
I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen
if I lose my mind.

642
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,722
I can't remember the last face I saw
that wasn't yours.

643
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,484
It's a perfectly good face.

644
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,245
I am losing my mind.

645
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,607
If anyone recognizes you,
you'll lose more than that.

646
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,002
Look, we are thousands of miles
from Westeros.

647
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,521
What am I?

648
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,688
One more drunk dwarf.

649
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,844
Whoa!

650
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,601
We have to go now.

651
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,842
Come on, hold it. Hold it.

652
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,046
Are you ready?

653
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,606
Slaves.

654
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,605
Yes, the Volantene masters
are very organized.

655
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,090
Flies for dung shovelers.

656
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,925
Hammers for builders.

657
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,048
Tears for whores.

658
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,924
Lest they forget.

659
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,682
Lord cast your light upon us.

660
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,800
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

661
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,082
We should keep moving.

662
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,283
I was once as you are now.

663
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,928
Bought and sold,

664
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,369
scourged and branded,

665
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:42,811
The only red priest we had in King's Landing
was Thoros of Myr.

666
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:43,881
This one's much better-looking.

667
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,008
The Lord of Light hears your voice.

668
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,884
He hears the king as he hears the slave;

669
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,282
he hears the Stone Men in their misery.

670
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,204
Stone men.

671
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,727
Good luck stopping
the spread of greyscale with prayer.

672
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,928
You'd have better luck
dancing away the plague.

673
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,570
He has sent you a savior!

674
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:06,170
From the fire she was reborn
to remake the world!

675
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,929
The Dragon Queen!

676
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,641
We're going to meet the savior.
You should have told me.

677
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,166
Who doesn't want to meet the savior?

678
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,401
Come on.

679
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,849
Let's find a brothel.

680
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,686
Build your house in a day.

681
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,403
It's good luck to rub a dwarf's head.

682
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,889
It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.

683
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,844
See? We blend right in.

684
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,242
Just two more travelers mad with lust.

685
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,685
Thank you.

686
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,368
What curious hair.

687
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,407
The Mother of Dragons!

688
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:40,208
It appears you're not
the only Targaryen supporter.

689
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,003
We were just heading east to see you.

690
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,809
I've got a dragon for you.

691
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,087
How much to make him spit fire?

692
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:55,003
Someone who inspires priests and whores
is worth taking seriously.

693
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,565
What makes you worth that much?

694
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,120
- I'm magic.
- I’ll bet you bloody are.

695
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,606
Well, she's taken.

696
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,407
Where are you going?

697
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,922
I need to speak to someone with hair.

698
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,771
- Hello.
- Hello.

699
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,201
You've got no drink.

700
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,044
You've got no money.

701
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,202
Do I look like a man without money?

702
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,643
Never trust looks.

703
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,530
Until quite recently,
I was one of the richest men in the world.

704
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,804
But who needs wealth
when you can make a woman laugh?

705
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,969
I always pay my debts.

706
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,811
I'm well known for it.

707
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,165
You like her.

708
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,083
They all like her.

709
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,321
They all want to fuck a queen.

710
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,211
That's because they've never met a queen.

711
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,566
You're just saying that.

712
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,324
You know how to spot a liar.

713
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,726
If I could pick any girl here,

714
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,245
I would pick you.

715
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,685
Why?

716
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,607
Because you have a skeptical mind.

717
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,601
All right, then. I'm warning you,
we're going to have to wash you first.

718
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,361
Come on.

719
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,329
I'm sorry, I can't.

720
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:27,160
Of course you can. You're shy.

721
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,725
I'm not.

722
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,446
Have another drink.

723
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,330
Gladly, but this, I can't do.

724
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,324
Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am.

725
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,368
I hope it passes.

726
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,561
What will I do in my spare time?

727
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:49,251
Go for a piss. That's a start.

728
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,087
No need to worry. I was just...

729
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,241
Ch.

730
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,610
I thought you were someone else.

731
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,006
Shaw's almost over.

732
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:20,321
I'm sure there are girls inside
who'd be happy to oblige.

733
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,366
You've made some kind of mistake.

734
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:25,250
Why don't you tell me
what you think you're doing, and then...

735
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,088
I'm taking you to the queen.

736
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:41,500
<b><font color=#0E7521>Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
<b><font color=#0E7521>Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

2
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,443
Is that Estermont?

3
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,963
Tarth, Ser Jaime.

4
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,964
The Sapphire Isle.

5
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,728
Why are we on a merchant ship?
Why no Lannister sails?

6
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,564
This ship's sailing to Oldtown.

7
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,325
We'll get off earlier, not far from Sunspear,

8
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,880
row ourselves to the Dornish shore
in the night.

9
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,044
You ever been to Dorne?

10
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,889
- No.
- I have.

11
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,689
The Dornish are crazy.

12
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,286
All they want to do
is fight and fuck, fuck and fight.

13
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,442
You should be happy to go back then.

14
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,891
There's nothing like a good fight
to get you in the mood for fucking.

15
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,042
And there's nothing like
a fuck-mad Dornish girl

16
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,566
to clear your head for the next fight.

17
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,369
It's how the two work together.

18
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,489
Now we're gonna be doing a lot of fighting.
Well, I am.

19
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,250
But I don't imagine
we'll get to stick around for the rest.

20
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,004
Not after we've kidnapped their princess.

21
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,082
We're not kidnapping their princess.

22
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,369
We're rescuing my niece,
bringing her back to her family.

23
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,441
Your niece?

24
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,241
I've been doing this a long time.

25
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,129
- I'm good at it.
- That's why you're here.

26
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,089
I know. Why are you here?

27
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,682
Why not send 40 of me? Or an army?

28
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,725
Unlike most folks, you've actually got one.

29
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,170
Because I don't want to start a war.

30
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,202
That still doesn't explain
what you're doing here.

31
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,481
It has to be me.

32
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,646
If I'm putting something like this together,

33
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,563
a one-handed man who happens to be

34
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,211
one of the most recognizable faces
in Westeros is not...

35
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,970
It has to be me.

36
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,164
You set your brother free, didn't you?

37
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,484
I'll bet your sister didn't like that.

38
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,482
Varys set him free.

39
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,931
Well,

40
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,087
if you ever see the wee fucker,
give him my regards.

41
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,242
He murdered my father.

42
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,924
If I ever see him, I'll split him in two.

43
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,129
And then I'll give him your regards.

44
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,527
The Iron Bank has called in
one-tenth of the crown's debts.

45
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,171
Given the expense
of rebuilding the royal fleet...

46
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,685
How much can the crown afford?

47
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,125
With winter coming,

48
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,563
half what they ask? Less?

49
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,530
You're the Master of Coin.
How do we pay them?

50
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,162
Well, House Tyrell could front the gold,
and the crown would pay us back in time,

51
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,289
or I'd have words with my daughter.

52
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,561
You've already given us too much.

53
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,843
No, we must arrange better terms
with the Iron Bank.

54
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,331
- Absolutely.
- In person.

55
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,961
Me?

56
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,963
We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank,

57
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,641
someone of importance
to show these bankers our respect.

58
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,690
As the king's Master of Coin,
I can think of no one more qualified.

59
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,489
I would be honored, Your Grace.

60
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,565
The king's expressed concern about
his father-in-law's safety on this voyage.

61
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,085
He's ordered Ser Meryn
to personally lead your escort.

62
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,640
My very own Kingsguard?
Please express my...

63
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,165
Safe travels, Lord Tyrell.

64
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,171
Of course. Of course.

65
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,561
I'll give your regards to the
Titan of Braavos.

66
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,204
The Small Council grows smaller and smaller.

67
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,009
Not small enough.

68
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,286
May I offer you some wine?

69
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,650
No.

70
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,887
The old High Septon
would have asked the vintage.

71
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,123
I could say that our minds
are temples to the Seven,

72
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,521
and should be kept pure.

73
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,729
But the truth is, I don't like the taste.

74
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,241
Hmm.

75
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,241
How may I serve?

76
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,161
All over Westeros
we hear of septs being burned,

77
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,083
Silent Sisters raped,

78
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,403
the bodies of holy men piled in the streets.

79
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,562
Wars teach people to obey the sword,
not the gods.

80
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,927
Perhaps the gods need a sword of their own.

81
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,610
In the days before the Targaryens,

82
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,042
the Faith Militant dispensed
the justice of the Seven.

83
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,682
Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed
more than two centuries ago.

84
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,162
If I explain their holy purpose
to my son, the king,

85
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,450
I have no doubt he will sign a decree
arming the believers you felt worthy.

86
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,005
An army that defends
the bodies and souls of the common people?

87
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,526
An army in service to the gods themselves.

88
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,645
And to you, of course,

89
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,322
as the chosen representative of the Seven.

90
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,091
An honor I never expected.

91
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,969
Or ever wished for.

92
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,565
Which is why you were chosen.

93
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,444
You and I both know how the world works.

94
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,206
Too often, the wicked are the wealthiest,
beyond the reach of justice.

95
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,046
The king himself cannot always
punish those who deserve it most.

96
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,010
All sinners are equal before the gods.

97
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,883
What would you say if I told you
of a great sinner in our very midst?

98
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,804
Shielded by gold and privilege.

99
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,486
May the Father judge him justly.

100
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,170
What are you doing?

101
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,884
Help me! Help me!

102
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,607
Yeah. Yeah.

103
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,211
Get off me!

104
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,521
Come on.

105
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,365
Shut up! Move!

106
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,848
This is Lord Petyr Baelish's establishment.

107
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,327
Cocksuckers.

108
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,083
Boy fucker.

109
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,688
You buggering filth!

110
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,882
There's a special place
in the seventh hell for your kind.

111
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,566
Please. Please, I'll pay.

112
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,526
I'll pay all of you.

113
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,520
Yes, you will.

114
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,121
Seize him.

115
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,291
Sinner.

116
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,727
Get your hands off me.

117
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,168
Ser Loras of House Tyrell,
you have broken the laws of gods and men.

118
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,007
Who do you think you are?

119
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,481
Justice.

120
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,881
Why is my brother in a cell?

121
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,961
I don't know.

122
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,204
I didn't order it.

123
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,441
We both know who did.

124
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,083
You told me
she was returning to Casterly Rock.

125
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,923
Are you saying my mother's behind this?

126
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,048
She's jealous you're not hers anymore.

127
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,364
Arresting my brother is her revenge.

128
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,442
Aren't you and Mother getting along?

129
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,041
Oh, my sweet, sweet king.

130
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,844
Do you have any affection for me at all?

131
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,720
Of course I do.

132
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,205
You're my queen.

133
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,360
I can't bear to think of my brother
locked away in some grimy cell.

134
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,762
I'll set him free for you.

135
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,251
Do you promise?

136
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,727
I demand that Ser Loras be freed now.

137
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,446
Did I arrest him?

138
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,050
Well, no.

139
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,007
But you armed the Faith Militant.

140
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,084
You gave the High Sparrow an army.

141
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,366
I did.

142
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,002
And your wife has every right to criticize.

143
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,606
We can't allow fanatics
to arrest the queen's brother,

144
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,523
no matter his perversions.

145
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,801
Then,

146
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,327
can I tell Margaery
you'll have Ser Loras released?

147
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,880
I told you, I'm not holding Ser Loras.

148
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,011
You're the king.

149
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,051
I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow,
he'll release the poor boy.

150
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,451
Halt!

151
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,810
His Holiness is praying.
He will not be disturbed.

152
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,160
Give the order, and we'll
clear out this rabble.

153
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,523
You mean kill them?

154
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,044
Here, at the sept?

155
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,083
You'd be sending them
to meet the gods that they love.

156
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,170
Bastard!

157
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,321
You're an abomination!

158
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,564
Born of sin!

159
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,885
Filthy bastard!

160
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,565
We'll find another way.

161
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,645
Abomination!

162
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,011
My queen?

163
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,847
There was no way
to free Ser Loras without violence.

164
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,966
You're the King of the Andals,

165
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,681
the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
the Protector of the Realm,

166
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,889
and you let a band of fanatics
imprison your brother-by-law.

167
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,091
I'm going to speak with the High Sparrow.

168
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,924
Are you? When?

169
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,211
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

170
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,567
He was praying just now.

171
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,405
I have to send word to Grandmother.

172
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,250
Will you come back later?

173
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,042
I need to be with my family, Your Grace.

174
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,125
Of course.

175
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,884
You think highly of this boy?

176
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,401
Good.

177
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,891
Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

178
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,170
And a bastard by some tavern slut.

179
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,050
Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way.

180
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,884
I should have given you a son.

181
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,365
Not your fault.

182
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,885
Whose, then?

183
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,961
I gave you nothing but weakness

184
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,161
and deformity.

185
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,325
Those scars mean nothing
to the Lord of Light.

186
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,890
My lady.

187
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,086
Her father is the Lord's chosen king,

188
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,686
and her father's blood
runs through her veins.

189
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,162
You march on Winterfell soon?

190
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,528
We must to beat the snows.

191
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,288
Once before, you put your faith in Ser Davos
and left me behind.

192
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,848
I hope you won't make that mistake again.

193
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,126
I won't.

194
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,760
I need you.

195
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,241
You only need faith, my king.

196
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,610
And you. What do you need?

197
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,370
To serve my Lord.

198
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,725
Lord Ashford.

199
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,609
Lady Caulfield.

200
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,925
Lord Smallwood.

201
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,051
I've never even heard of these people.

202
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,003
They haven't heard of you, either.

203
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,047
But we need men, and they have some.

204
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,410
How many men does this Lord Mayzen
have to send us?

205
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,887
More than Lord Wibberley.

206
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,521
- Not him.
- I know. I'm sorry.

207
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,250
But we need men and supplies,

208
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,450
and Roose Bolton's the Warden of the North.

209
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,646
He murdered my brother.

210
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,530
We swore to be the watchers on the Wall.

211
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,009
We can't watch the Wall with 50 men.

212
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,606
And we can't get more men
without help from the Warden of the North.

213
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,724
Apologies, my lady.

214
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,410
Lord Commander.

215
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,203
How can I help you?

216
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,362
Come with us when we ride south.

217
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,410
None of us know the castle as well as you do.

218
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,087
Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses,
its people.

219
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,841
Winterfell was your home once.

220
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,800
Don't you want to chase the rats out of it?

221
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,046
Castle Black is my home now.

222
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,569
The Night's Watch take no part
in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.

223
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,085
There's only one war.

224
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,684
Life against death.

225
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,003
Come, let me show you
what you're fighting for.

226
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,082
You're gonna show me
some vision in the fire?

227
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,448
Forgive me. I don't trust in visions.

228
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,121
No visions. No magic.

229
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,766
Just life.

230
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,447
Do you feel my heart beating?

231
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,009
There's power in you.

232
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,927
You resist it, and that's your mistake.
Embrace it.

233
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,890
The Lord of Light made us male and female.

234
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,081
Two parts of a greater whole.

235
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,731
In our joining, there's power.

236
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,640
Power to make life,

237
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,246
power to make light,

238
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,322
and power to cast shadows.

239
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,050
I don't think Stannis
would like that very much.

240
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,525
Then we shouldn't tell him.

241
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,761
- I can't.
- Why?

242
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,681
I swore a vow.

243
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,410
I loved another.

244
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,167
The dead don't need lovers.

245
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,361
Only the living.

246
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,280
I know.

247
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,411
But I still love her.

248
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,609
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

249
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,487
Are you lonely?

250
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,521
Just bored.

251
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,002
My father used to tell me that boredom
indicates a lack of inner resources.

252
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,766
Were you bored a lot, too?

253
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,890
I know Castle Black
is no place for a child, but...

254
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,611
I like it. I thought I'd be left at home.

255
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,443
I know Mother didn't want to bring me.

256
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,720
Why do you say that?

257
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,729
She told me, "I don't want to bring you."

258
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,285
She shouldn't have said that.

259
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,289
Are you ashamed of me, Father?

260
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,166
When you were an infant,

261
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,171
a Dornish trader landed on Dragonstone.

262
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,323
His goods were junk
except for one wooden doll.

263
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,122
He had even sewn a dress on it
in the colors of our house.

264
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:32,849
No doubt he'd heard of your birth
and assumed new fathers were easy targets.

265
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,323
I still remember how you smiled
when I put that doll in your cradle.

266
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,803
How you pressed it to your cheek.

267
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,647
By the time we burned the doll,
it was too late.

268
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,649
I was told you would die.

269
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,811
Or worse,

270
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,809
the greyscale would go slow.

271
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:08,043
Let you grow just enough to know the world
before taking it away from you.

272
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,691
Everyone advised me to send you
to the ruins of Valyria

273
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,962
to live out your short
life with the stone men,

274
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,884
before the sickness
spread through the castle.

275
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,449
I told them all to go to hell.

276
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,450
I called in every maester
on this side of the world.

277
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,569
Every healer. Every apothecary.

278
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,767
They stopped the disease and saved your life.

279
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,364
Because you do not belong across the world
with the bloody stone men.

280
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,401
You are the Princess Shireen
of House Baratheon.

281
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,044
And you are my daughter.

282
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,801
I thought I might find you here.

283
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,290
Your Aunt Lyanna.

284
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,243
Father never talked about her,

285
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,604
but sometimes I'd find him down here
lighting the candles.

286
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,845
They say she was beautiful.

287
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,205
I saw her once.

288
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,443
I was a boy living with your mother's family.

289
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,490
Lord Whent held a great tourney at Harrenhal.

290
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,324
Everyone was there.

291
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,529
The Mad King, your father,

292
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,204
Robert Baratheon,

293
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,326
and Lyanna.

294
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,641
She was already promised to Robert.

295
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,531
You can imagine what it was like for me,
a boy from nowhere with nothing to his name,

296
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,207
watching these legendary men
tilting at the lists.

297
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,082
The last two riders were Barristan Selmy
and Rhaegar Targaryen.

298
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,841
When Rhaegar won,
everyone cheered for their prince.

299
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,843
I remember the girls laughing
when he took off his helmet,

300
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,127
and they saw that silver hair.

301
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,361
How handsome he was.

302
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,285
Until he rode right past his wife,

303
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,121
Elia Martell, and all the smiles died.

304
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,727
I've never seen so many people so quiet.

305
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,924
He rode past his wife,

306
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,281
and he lay a crown of winter roses
in Lyanna's lap.

307
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,885
Blue as frost.

308
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,891
How many tens of thousands had to die
because Rhaegar chose your aunt?

309
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,562
Yes, he chose her.

310
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,801
And then he kidnapped her and raped her.

311
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,491
Come.

312
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,651
Let's speak somewhere
the dead can't hear us.

313
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,126
You're dressed for riding.

314
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,201
I am.

315
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,724
Where are you going?

316
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,848
King's Landing.

317
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,490
King's Landing?

318
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,642
Cersei sent for me.

319
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,087
We mustn't let her sniff out any trouble.

320
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,970
You can't leave me here.

321
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,282
I know how hard it is
to live with people you despise.

322
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,407
Believe me.

323
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,406
But it won't be for long.

324
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,327
How do you know?

325
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,369
Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black.

326
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,566
He'll march south to King's Landing
before the winter snows block his way.

327
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,042
But first, he has to take Winterfell.

328
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,441
- You don't know that.
- I do.

329
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,522
Once he liberates these lands
from the Boltons,

330
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,120
he'll rally your father's bannermen
to his cause.

331
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,728
With the North behind him,
Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne.

332
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,723
You think he'll defeat the Boltons?

333
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,170
He has a larger army.

334
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,891
He's the finest military commander
in Westeros.

335
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,726
A betting man would
put his money on Stannis.

336
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,246
I am a betting man.

337
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,209
And if you're right?

338
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,282
Stannis takes Winterfell,

339
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,489
he rescues you from
the most despised family in the North.

340
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,530
Grateful for your late father's
courageous support of his claim,

341
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,046
he names you Wardeness of the North.

342
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,445
But I...

343
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,204
I wouldn't...

344
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,691
Wardeness of the North?

345
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,967
You are the last surviving Stark.

346
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,441
He needs you.

347
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,370
And what if you're wrong?
What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell?

348
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,131
Or he does, and the Boltons defeat him?

349
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,727
Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay,
and make him yours.

350
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,931
I don't know how to do that.

351
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,764
Of course you do.

352
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,604
He's already fallen for you.

353
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,770
His father frightens me.

354
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,410
He should. He's a dangerous man.

355
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,523
But even the most dangerous men
can be outmaneuvered.

356
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,487
And you've learned to maneuver
from the very best.

357
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,441
I'll return before too long.

358
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,329
You be strong without me.

359
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,202
The North will be yours.

360
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,925
Do you believe me?

361
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,088
I expect I'll be a married woman
by the time you return.

362
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,001
Breakfast.

363
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,124
That would have been a shit way to die.

364
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,569
As far as I've seen,
they're all shit ways to die.

365
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,723
Aye, but your lot have
to give the singers a good ending.

366
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,644
I don't care
what's sung about me when I'm dead.

367
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,960
No?

368
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:32,043
Two knights off to rescue a princess.
Sounds like a good song to me.

369
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,525
Sounds like all the rest.

370
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,323
What about you?

371
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,641
What shit way would you choose?

372
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:48,045
In my own keep, drinking my own wine,
watching my sons grovel for my fortune.

373
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,761
How disappointing.

374
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,810
I thought you'd have
something more exciting planned.

375
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,166
I've had an exciting life.
I want my death to be boring.

376
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,764
How do you want to go?

377
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,241
In the arms of the woman I love.

378
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,001
She want the same thing?

379
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,685
Let's go.

380
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,242
The captain of that ship,
what was he, Braavosi?

381
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,049
Pentoshi.

382
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,690
And he's headed to Oldtown?

383
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,728
As I said. Why?

384
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,448
What's to stop him
from docking down the coast,

385
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,166
and telling the locals
that Jaime Lannister is in Dome?

386
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,730
A bag of gold.

387
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,050
I'm not sure you understand

388
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,691
how much people hate your family
in this part of the world.

389
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,603
It was a heavy bag.

390
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,490
And I bet he swore all
kinds of oaths to get it.

391
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,688
But you won't be around if he breaks 'em.

392
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,602
- How many you count?
- Four.

393
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,844
How many do you think you can take?

394
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,922
One, if he's slow.

395
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,170
Halt!

396
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,325
Over the hill.

397
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,528
Fucked in the ass.

398
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,961
Hyah!

399
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,361
Morning, lads.

400
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,647
Glad we found you.

401
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,121
Who are you?

402
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,969
Cooper. This is Darnell.

403
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,690
You're from King's Landing.

404
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,489
Accent gave me away?

405
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,361
Flea Bottom, whelped and whipped.

406
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,487
Why are you here?

407
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,128
Our ship capsized in the night.
We managed to swim ashore.

408
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,122
It was a near thing, really.

409
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,402
Thought the sharks would get us.

410
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,362
There are no sharks in Dorne.

411
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,281
Could have sworn those were shark fins.

412
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,091
Dolphins, maybe.

413
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,165
Throw your swords in the sand.

414
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,961
Boys, there's no need for this.

415
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:20,125
Just point us in the right direction,
we'll find our way home.

416
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,368
Swords in the sand now.

417
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,887
Hyah! Hyah!

418
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,210
That one should be slow enough.

419
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,684
Nice move.

420
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,851
Luck.

421
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,562
You had a wonderful teacher.

422
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,163
Always wanted a Dornish stallion.

423
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,847
Beasts can run a day and
night without tiring.

424
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,003
We'll ride to the Water Gardens
with a nice breeze in our faces.

425
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,570
First we need to bury these bodies.

426
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,131
Birds have to eat, too.

427
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,527
Corpses raise questions.
Questions raise armies.

428
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,489
We're not here to start a war.

429
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,931
Do you know how long it'll take us
to dig all those holes?

430
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,364
I can't dig very well with one hand.

431
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,408
Not at all, really.

432
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,966
Mama.

433
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,880
Nym, Obara.

434
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,968
Will it be war?

435
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,566
Prince Doran will weep for your father,
but nothing else.

436
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,120
We must avenge Oberyn ourselves.

437
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,329
Without Doran, we have no army
to march against the Lannisters.

438
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,163
We don't need an army to start a war.

439
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,845
Queen Cersei loves her children,

440
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,841
and we have one of them.

441
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,724
You may have a problem.

442
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,283
A ship's captain
who found me in Planky Town

443
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,044
claiming he had information to sell.

444
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,929
He told me he smuggled
Jaime Lannister into Dorne.

445
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,444
He's come for Myrcella.

446
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,128
If he gets to her before we do,
we lose our only chance for revenge.

447
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,050
You must choose.

448
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,449
Doran's way and peace,

449
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,330
or my way and war.

450
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,202
I'm with you always.

451
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,565
Nym?

452
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,291
Obara?

453
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,321
When I was a child,
Oberyn came to take me to court.

454
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,291
I had never seen this man,
and yet he called himself my father.

455
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,965
My mother wept, said I was too young
and a girl.

456
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,604
Oberyn tossed his spear at my feet and said,

457
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,524
"Girl or boy, we fight our battles,

458
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,729
"but the gods let us choose our weapons."

459
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:49,404
My father pointed to the spear,
and then to my mother's tears.

460
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,447
I made my choice long ago.

461
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,724
Will you untie me?

462
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,924
Will you please untie me?

463
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,926
Will you please?

464
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,606
Thank you.

465
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,881
Who are you?

466
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,961
Your captor.

467
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,251
Do you have wine?

468
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,560
No.

469
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,045
Can't sleep without wine.

470
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,651
Then stay awake.

471
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,810
You're going the wrong way.

472
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:10,160
My sister is in Westeros. Westeros is west.

473
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,964
We're heading east.

474
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,247
I'm not taking you to your sister.

475
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,081
You said you were taking me to the queen.

476
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,927
I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen.
She's the queen I serve.

477
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,525
What a waste of a good kidnapping.

478
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,009
It so happens I was heading there myself.

479
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,842
What business would you have
with the queen?

480
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,400
Gold and glory. Oh, and hate.

481
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,206
If you'd ever met my sister,
you'd understand.

482
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,568
So now that it's clear
we are on the same side...

483
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,364
A highborn knight from the north of Westeros
down on his luck in Essos.

484
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,723
Dragon epaulets, bear sigil breastplate.

485
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,484
You're Jorah Mormont.

486
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,689
I have to ask.

487
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,288
How exactly were you serving your queen
in a whorehouse half a world away?

488
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,321
Is it possible that you were running?

489
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,121
Why would you be running?
And why would she have sent you away?

490
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,207
Oh, wait.

491
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,921
You were spying on her, weren't you?

492
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,690
It's all coming back to me.

493
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,728
I was drunk through
most of the Small Council meetings,

494
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,529
but it's all coming back.

495
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,769
You passed notes to Varys' little birds.

496
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,960
She found out, didn't she?

497
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,281
Found out and exiled you.

498
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,683
Now you hope to
win back her favor with a gift.

499
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,611
Risky scheme.

500
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,000
One might even say desperate.

501
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,849
You think Daenerys will execute me
and pardon you?

502
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,760
I'd say the reverse is just as likely.

503
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,125
Everyone looks happy enough from up here.

504
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,650
What?

505
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,728
I was thinking about all
the times your brother

506
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,247
made me go with him down from the Red Keep
into the streets of King's Landing.

507
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,164
- Why?
- He liked to walk among the people.

508
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,810
He liked to sing to them.

509
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,767
He sang to them?

510
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,524
Yes.

511
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:56,530
Rhaegar would pick a spot on the Hook,
or the Street of Seeds, and then he'd sing.

512
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,931
Just like all the other minstrels.

513
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,161
And what did you do?

514
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,005
I made sure no one killed him.

515
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,325
And I collected the money.

516
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,402
What? He liked to see
how much he could make.

517
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,488
- He was good?
- He was very good.

518
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,800
Viserys never told you?

519
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,406
He told me Rhaegar
was good at killing people.

520
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,285
Rhaegar never liked killing.
He loved singing.

521
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,331
And what did you do with the money?

522
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,688
Well, one time, he gave it
to the next minstrel down the street.

523
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,240
One time, he gave it
to an orphanage in Flea Bottom.

524
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:28,047
One time, we got horribly drunk.

525
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,567
Your Grace.

526
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,688
Hizdahr is here,
waiting in the audience chamber.

527
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,607
How many others are there?

528
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,805
Fifty? 100?

529
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,564
Will you be joining us?

530
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,366
I think I can protect you
from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

531
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,886
I think I can protect me
from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

532
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,050
Go, Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me.

533
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,404
Your Grace.

534
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,802
All men must die,
but not all can die in glory.

535
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,928
- Glory?
- Why else do men fight?

536
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,722
Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea
and conquer the Seven Kingdoms?

537
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,326
So their names would live on.

538
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,244
Those who find victory in the fighting pits
will never become kings,

539
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,368
but their names will live on.

540
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,283
It's the best chance they'll ever have.

541
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,850
Is that what you used to tell men

542
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,810
before you set them
to butchering each other for sport?

543
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,690
Today is the traditional start
of the fighting season.

544
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,489
I do not recognize this tradition.

545
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,683
Traditions are the only thing
that will hold this city,

546
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,205
your city, together.

547
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,808
Without them, former slaves and
former masters have nothing in common.

548
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:44,082
Nothing but centuries
of mistrust and resentment.

549
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,802
I can't promise
this is the answer to all our problems,

550
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,930
but it's a start.

551
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,404
Sons of the Harpy.

552
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:57,500
<b><font color=#0E7521>Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
<b><font color=#0E7521>Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

2
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,121
I'm so sorry, my queen.

3
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,005
He was a good man.

4
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,560
"Barristan the Bold,"
they called him.

5
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,331
He crossed a continent to serve me.

6
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,481
He was a loyal friend.

7
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,126
And he died in an alley,

8
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,244
butchered by cowards
who hide behind masks.

9
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,725
We could pull back to the pyramid district,

10
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,770
secure it, and use it as a base
from which to operate.

11
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,123
Then we clean the city out,

12
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,962
neighborhood by neighborhood,
street by street,

13
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,122
until the rats have nowhere left to hide.

14
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,485
I prefer your earlier suggestion.

15
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,366
Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's
great families and bring them to me.

16
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,528
But... I'm the leader
of my family.

17
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,726
No, Your Grace...

18
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,566
I had nothing to do with this.

19
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,449
Your Grace!

20
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,081
Walk forward.

21
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,610
You cannot do this.

22
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,441
Another step.

23
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,370
They will eat you

24
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,731
if I tell them to.

25
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,688
They may eat you even if I don't.

26
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,524
Children.

27
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,887
Some say I should give up on them.

28
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,531
But a good mother
never gives up on her children.

29
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,203
She disciplines them if she must.

30
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,609
But she does not give up on them.

31
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,044
Who is innocent?

32
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,961
Maybe all of you are,

33
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,921
maybe none of you are.

34
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,164
Maybe,

35
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,205
I should let the dragons decide.

36
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,609
All men must die.

37
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,805
Don't want to overfeed them.

38
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,769
Tomorrow perhaps.

39
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,282
"And though Daenerys
maintains her grip on Slaver's Bay,

40
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,682
"forces rise against her
from within and without.

41
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,402
"She refuses to leave until the freedom
of the former slaves is secure."

42
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,609
She sounds like quite a woman.

43
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,489
And she's alone,

44
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,130
under siege,

45
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,682
no family to guide her or protect her.

46
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,646
Her last relation thousands of miles away,

47
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,842
useless, dying.

48
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,561
Don't say that, Maester Aemon.

49
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,685
A Targaryen alone in the world

50
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,123
is a terrible thing.

51
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,204
Maester Aemon.

52
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,044
Lord Commander.

53
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,570
Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone.

54
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,245
How are you feeling?

55
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,361
Oh, like a 100-year-old man
slowly freezing to death.

56
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,410
I need your advice.

57
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,686
There's something I want to do,
something I have to do.

58
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,081
But it'll divide the Night's Watch.

59
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,601
Bitterly.

60
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,207
Half the men will hate me
the moment I give the order.

61
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,767
Half the men hate you already,
Lord Commander.

62
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,285
Do it.

63
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,810
But you don't know what it is.

64
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,530
That doesn't matter.

65
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,806
You do.

66
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,726
You will find little joy in your command.

67
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,203
But with luck,

68
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,842
you will find the strength
to do what needs to be done.

69
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,765
Kill the boy, Jon Snow.

70
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,083
Winter is almost upon us.

71
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,009
Kill the boy,

72
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,850
and let the man be born.

73
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,168
Where are the rest of the free folk now?

74
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,524
Where have they gone?

75
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,882
Who leads them?

76
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,281
They followed Mance.

77
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,931
They won't follow anyone else.

78
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,130
What about you?

79
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,487
Hard to lead when you're in chains.

80
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,765
What if I unchained you?

81
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,683
Why would you do that?

82
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,044
Because you are not my enemy.

83
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,451
And I'm not yours.

84
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,444
You sure seemed like my enemy
when you were killing my friends.

85
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,921
For 8,000 years
the Night's Watch have sworn an oath

86
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,606
to be the shield
that guards the realms of men.

87
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,410
And for 8,000 years,
we've fallen short of that oath.

88
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,526
You belong to the realms of men.

89
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,881
All of you.

90
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,768
And now everything is going to change?

91
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,524
- It is.
- Why now?

92
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,366
Because now
I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

93
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,888
What would you have me do,
Lord Commander?

94
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,962
I'd have you go north of the Wall.

95
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,284
Gather the remaining free folk,
wherever they are, and bring them back here.

96
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,409
I'll open the gates for them
and let them through.

97
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,165
I'll find them lands to
settle south of the Wall.

98
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,881
They won't kneel for you, and neither will l.

99
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,805
I don't want them to kneel for me.

100
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,406
I want them to fight with me
when the time comes.

101
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,171
The day I ask my people
to fight with the crows

102
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,971
is the day my people
cut my guts from my belly

103
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,451
and make me eat them.

104
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,330
And how many of your people can't fight?

105
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,327
The women, the children, the old, the sick,
what happens to them?

106
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,402
You're condemning them to death.

107
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,047
Worse than death
because you're too proud to make peace.

108
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,768
Or maybe you're not proud.

109
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,090
Maybe you're just a coward.

110
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,090
Easy thing to say to a man in chains.

111
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,364
Your people need a leader.

112
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,769
And they need to get south of the Wall
before it's too late.

113
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,729
We don't have much time, and they have less.

114
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,644
The Walkers are coming,
and they'll hit your people first.

115
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,331
I'm not asking you to make peace
to save your skin.

116
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,002
Make peace to save your people.

117
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,086
Most of them are at Hardhome.

118
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,161
You know where that is?

119
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,651
Up on Storrold's Point.

120
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,125
I can give you 10 horses and nine other men.
You can get there in a week.

121
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,690
We'll need ships.

122
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,811
I'll talk to King Stannis
about lending you his fleet.

123
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,721
All right, then.

124
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,691
You're coming with me.

125
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,571
You're the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

126
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,888
They need to hear it from you.

127
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,281
They need to know
the ships they are boarding

128
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,522
won't be torched in the middle of the sea.

129
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,963
You come with me,

130
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,525
or I don't go.

131
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,285
You'd bring wildlings here,
through our gates?

132
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,046
Men, women, and children
will die by the thousands if we do nothing.

133
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,250
Let them die. We got our own to worry about.
Less enemies for us.

134
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,125
Fewer.

135
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,720
- What?
- Nothing.

136
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,284
Look, well, there is
good farmland in the Gift.

137
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,807
Land that no one uses now.
A dozen abandoned villages.

138
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,121
And why do you think
the farmers abandoned those villages?

139
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,566
Because the wildlings raided them for years.

140
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,003
Cut them down
just like they did this boy's people.

141
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,766
Aye!

142
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,369
We've been fighting them
for thousands of years.

143
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,608
They've slaughtered villages.

144
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,963
They've slaughtered our brothers.

145
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,610
And we've slaughtered theirs.

146
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,004
I will follow you anywhere, you know that.

147
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,286
- But they killed Grenn.
- Yes.

148
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,761
- And they killed Pyp.
- Aye.

149
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:14,368
They killed 50 of our brothers.
I can't forget that.

150
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,205
I can't forgive it.

151
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,726
You were at the Fist of the First Men.

152
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,610
If we abandon them,
you know what they become.

153
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,208
We can learn to live with the wildlings,
or we can add them to the army of the dead.

154
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,486
Whatever they are now,
they're better than that.

155
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,161
Thank you.

156
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,490
Olly.

157
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,529
If you have something you want to say to me,

158
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,170
say it.

159
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,165
It's all right.

160
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,202
You don't mean it, do you?

161
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,571
Telling the wildlings you want to make peace.

162
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,529
You're just doing it to trick them.

163
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,126
It's not a trick.

164
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,605
They burned my village.

165
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,684
They put an arrow through my father's head
right in front of me.

166
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,442
They butchered my mother,
everyone I ever knew.

167
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,608
I know what it's like
to lose the people you love.

168
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,488
I know this is hard for you.

169
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,923
But winter is coming.

170
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,249
We know what's coming with it.

171
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,364
We can't face it alone.

172
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,403
Will there be anything else you need,
Lord Commander?

173
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,890
No.

174
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,806
She's far away from the Lannisters.

175
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,921
This is her home.

176
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,924
Maybe Lady Sansa's better off here.

177
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,441
Better off with the Boltons,
who murdered her mother and brother?

178
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,886
Sansa's in danger,
even if she doesn't realize it.

179
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,764
Thank you.

180
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,086
You've lived here a long time?

181
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,891
Aye.

182
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,450
Did you know Lord Eddard?

183
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,527
I knew him,

184
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,561
and his father before him.

185
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,562
The Starks are gone now.

186
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,369
Not all of them.

187
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,206
I know who's inside that castle.

188
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,044
Everyone knows.

189
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,925
The Boltons.

190
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,843
I'm not talking about the Boltons.

191
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,924
I need to get a message to her.

192
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,331
To Sansa Stark.

193
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,171
Who are you?

194
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,164
Someone who swore to keep her safe.

195
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,930
Swore to who?

196
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,001
Her mother.

197
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,130
Her mother's dead.

198
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,726
That doesn't release me from an oath.

199
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,360
I served Lady Catelyn.

200
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,683
I serve her still.

201
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,689
Who do you serve?

202
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,770
Come back here.

203
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,881
Myranda.

204
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,083
I saw you staring at her.

205
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,730
I'm going to marry her.

206
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,884
That will involve looking at her
from time to time.

207
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,050
You said you'd marry me.

208
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,204
And I meant it.

209
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,203
When I was a bastard named Snow.

210
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,769
But I'm a Bolton now.

211
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,969
What I want is no longer
the primary consideration.

212
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,923
I'm furthering a dynasty.

213
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,407
Do you think she's pretty?

214
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,367
Of course I do. I'm not blind.

215
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,321
You think she's pretty, too.

216
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,443
I'm looking forward to our wedding night.

217
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,002
But don't worry,
I'll have plenty of time for you.

218
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,847
Perhaps I'll marry, too.

219
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,208
You're the kennel master's daughter.

220
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,844
Who are you going to marry,
the stable keeper's son?

221
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,005
You're mine.

222
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,969
You're not going anywhere.

223
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,522
Unless I have to listen
to more of your jealousy.

224
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,002
Jealousy bores me. You remember
what happens to people who bore me.

225
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,441
You're not going to bore me,
are you, Myranda?

226
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,450
Never.

227
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,367
Beg pardon, my lady.
I've come to refill the wash basin.

228
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,249
Oh, I don't need...

229
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,881
You still have friends in the North.

230
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,804
If you're ever in trouble,

231
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,805
light a candle
in the highest window of the broken tower.

232
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,160
- But who...
- You're not alone.

233
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,285
I like your dress.

234
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,131
Who made it for you?

235
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,764
Uh, I made it myself.

236
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,491
Really?

237
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,730
Who... Who are you?

238
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,969
I'm Myranda, the kennel master's daughter.

239
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,361
May I?

240
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,531
Oh, wonderful.

241
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,491
The stitching.

242
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,810
- Who taught you?
- My mother.

243
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,207
I'm sorry for what happened to her.

244
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,327
Thank you.

245
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,721
It's good that she taught you.

246
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,926
It was a gift.

247
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,962
Now every time you wear
something you made,

248
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,407
you can remember her.

249
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,481
I'd rather have a mother.

250
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,048
I know. It's not the same.

251
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,167
Still, it's good to remember.

252
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,928
Remember the way things were.

253
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,484
I almost forgot.

254
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,051
There's something else

255
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,325
to help you remember.

256
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,606
Down there, at the end.

257
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,411
What is it?

258
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,284
That would spoil the surprise.

259
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,808
Go ahead, it's perfectly safe.

260
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,922
You won't believe it when you see it.

261
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,561
Theon?

262
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,207
You shouldn't be here.

263
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,280
You smell particularly ripe this evening.

264
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,610
Pour me some wine.

265
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,202
Do you have something to tell me?

266
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,005
No, my lord.

267
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,485
Reek.

268
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,803
She saw me.

269
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,366
Who?

270
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,886
Sansa. Lady Sansa.

271
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,485
She came to the kennels.

272
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,286
She saw you?

273
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,931
Yes. I'm sorry, master.

274
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,240
Forgive me. I didn't think...

275
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,321
Come here.

276
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,526
You mustn't keep
secrets from me, Reek.

277
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,161
Get on your knees.

278
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,724
Give me your hand.

279
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,606
I forgive you.

280
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,131
I trust you find
your chamber suitable, my lady?

281
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,363
Yes, thank you.

282
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,601
Allow me.

283
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,921
Mother.

284
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,569
Thank you, Ramsay.

285
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:56,680
My lady, we are all a family, we northerners.

286
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,730
Our blood ties go back thousands of years.

287
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,686
So, I'd like to drink to our wedding.

288
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,290
May our happiness spread from Moat Cailin
to the Last Hearth.

289
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,931
- To your wedding.
- To your wedding.

290
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,282
It must be difficult for you,
being in a strange place.

291
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,170
This isn't a strange place,
this is my home.

292
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,004
It's the people who are strange.

293
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,291
You're right.

294
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,801
Very strange.

295
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,650
More wine, please.

296
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,971
I heard you two had been reunited.

297
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,241
A fitting place for it.

298
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,368
I like to imagine that
the last time you spoke

299
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,169
was in this very room.

300
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,728
Are you still angry with him after he...

301
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,446
What he did?

302
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,770
Don't worry.

303
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,848
The North remembers.

304
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,009
I punished him for it.

305
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,921
He's not ironborn anymore.

306
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,243
Not Theon Greyjoy anymore.

307
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,084
He's a new man.

308
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,689
A new person, anyway.

309
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,407
Aren't you, Reek?

310
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,045
Yes, master.

311
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,043
That's his new name, Reek.

312
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,124
Why are you doing this?

313
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,205
Because Reek has something to say to you.

314
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,881
Don't you, Reek?

315
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,044
An apology?

316
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,690
Apologize to Lady Sansa
for what you did.

317
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,244
Apologize for murdering her two brothers.

318
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,487
I'm sorry.

319
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,009
Look at her, Reek.

320
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,450
An apology doesn't mean anything
if you're not looking the person in the eye.

321
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,885
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry about what?

322
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,685
For killing your brothers.

323
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,848
There, over and done with.

324
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,571
Doesn't everyone feel better? I do.

325
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,650
That was getting very tense.

326
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,887
Whew.

327
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,123
You know what, my lady?

328
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,085
What with him having murdered your brothers

329
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,448
and the rest of your family gone,

330
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:20,044
Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin

331
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,009
that you have left.

332
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,761
Reek.

333
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,971
You will give away the bride.

334
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,567
Someone has to. What better person?

335
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,926
Good?
Good?

336
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,327
Yes, yes, very good.

337
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,011
Wonderful.

338
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,687
Walda and I have some good news as well,
since we're all together.

339
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,401
We're going to have a baby.

340
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,764
I'm very happy for you.

341
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,243
From the way she's carrying,
Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy.

342
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,565
How can you be sure?

343
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,880
Sure of what?

344
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,291
That she's pregnant.

345
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,450
I mean...

346
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,530
How can you tell?

347
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,326
Maester Wolkan
has assured us beyond all doubt.

348
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,642
So, how did you manage it?

349
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,324
Manage what?

350
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,686
Getting her pregnant.

351
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,808
I imagine you're familiar with the procedure.

352
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,044
Of course, but how did you find it?

353
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,367
You disgraced yourself at dinner,

354
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,242
parading that creature before the Stark girl.

355
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,725
And if it's a boy?

356
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,650
You're worried about your position.

357
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,722
My position is quite clear.

358
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,770
I'm your son

359
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,361
until a better alternative comes along.

360
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,011
You've never asked me about your mother.

361
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,051
Why would I?

362
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,441
She had me, she died.

363
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,165
And here we are.

364
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,204
She was a peasant girl.

365
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,009
Pretty in a common sort of way.

366
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,124
She was the miller's wife.

367
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,482
Apparently they had married
without my knowledge or consent,

368
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,925
so I had him hanged,

369
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,609
and I took her
beneath the tree where he was swaying.

370
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,324
She fought me the whole time.

371
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,648
She was lucky I didn't hang her, too.

372
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,365
A year later she came to my gates
with a squalling baby in her arms.

373
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,562
A baby she claimed was mine.

374
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,564
I nearly had her whipped,

375
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,642
and the child thrown in the river.

376
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,731
But then I looked at you,

377
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,567
and I saw then what I see now.

378
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,651
You are my son.

379
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,243
Stannis Baratheon
has an army at Castle Black,

380
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,483
but he won't stay for long.

381
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,206
He wants the Iron Throne,

382
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,682
and the road to King's Landing
comes right through Winterfell.

383
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,364
He means to take the North.

384
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,162
But the North is ours.

385
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,005
It's yours and mine.

386
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,443
Will you help me defeat him?

387
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,926
Yes.

388
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,681
Is this every book there is?

389
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,723
Every book there is?

390
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,051
In the world.

391
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,841
Well, no.

392
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,720
There are thousands
and thousands of books out there.

393
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,644
This library is rather small, actually.

394
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,688
Where you grew up, were there more books?

395
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,366
My father's not the most literate man.

396
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,641
They say the Citadel
has the largest library in the world.

397
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,881
Where's that?

398
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,521
The Citadel?

399
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,331
In Oldtown.

400
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,043
I'm sorry I don't know things.

401
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,811
Oh, Gilly, look at me.

402
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,444
You know how to do
a hundred things I can never do.

403
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,887
You can build a fire with wet wood.

404
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,440
You can cook. You can stitch a wound.

405
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,251
I can wash the linens. I can sweep the floor.

406
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,321
Well...

407
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,767
Why does the Citadel
have the biggest library?

408
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,561
It's where they train the maesters.

409
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,684
Like Maester Aemon?

410
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,001
I wanted to be one when I was young.

411
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,084
Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch.

412
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,241
Far more adventure up here anyway.

413
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,969
I wouldn't have met you.

414
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,608
Ah, Your Grace.

415
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,483
You're Samwell Tarly?

416
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,569
I am, Your Grace.

417
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,763
Your father is Randyll Tarly.

418
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,371
Defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford.

419
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,201
Only battle Robert ever lost.

420
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,769
I told him he shouldn't go
so far west so soon,

421
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,171
but he never listened.

422
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,804
Fine soldier, your father.

423
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,565
You don't look like a soldier.

424
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,560
But I'm told you killed a White Walker.

425
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,845
I did, Your Grace.

426
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,007
How?

427
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,003
With a dagger made of dragonglass.

428
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,326
Dragonglass?

429
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,606
What the maesters call obsidian.

430
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,490
I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone.

431
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,449
Why would obsidian kill a Walker?

432
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,124
I don't know.

433
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,770
I've been going through
all the old manuscripts

434
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,080
hoping to find something,

435
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,286
and all I've learned

436
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,489
is that the Children of the Forest
used to hunt with dragonglass.

437
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,121
The Lady Melisandre told me
that death marches on the Wall.

438
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,851
I've seen it, Your Grace.

439
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,010
Seen what?

440
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,889
The army of the dead.

441
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,047
And when they come...

442
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,248
We have to know how to fight them.

443
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,964
Keep reading, Samwell Tarly.

444
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,891
It's time.

445
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,405
Uh, Your Grace.

446
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,803
Wouldn't it be better to wait?

447
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,043
When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings,
we could have thousands more men.

448
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,169
If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings.
We can't wait that long.

449
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,926
We have the advantage,
more men, more horses, all fed and rested.

450
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,970
But every day we wait,
the odds shift in Bolton's favor.

451
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,042
This could turn to winter at any moment.

452
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,203
We have to act now. Give the order.
We march at sunrise.

453
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:56,649
I'll choose a dozen men to stay
and guard the queen and the princess.

454
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,131
No need. They're coming with us.

455
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,529
It's a tough road ahead,
Your Grace.

456
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,762
- Won't they be safer...
- Here?

457
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,087
Half these Watchmen are killers and rapists.

458
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,569
No, they march with us.

459
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,088
As you wish, Your Grace.

460
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,048
Do you think Father
will let me go down into the crypt?

461
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,121
Beg your pardon?

462
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,565
At Winterfell.

463
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,406
All the kings in the North are buried there.
Bran the Builder, and King Dorren, and...

464
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,290
First things first. It's a long march ahead.

465
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,964
And then we have to take the castle.

466
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,445
Is there going to be a battle?

467
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,887
Aye, princess,
but you won't be anywhere near...

468
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,287
That's enough talk of battle,
Ser Davos.

469
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,446
You'll scare the child.

470
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,851
Yes, my queen.

471
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,244
I'm not scared.

472
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,401
Well, I am.

473
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,401
When the battle comes,
promise you'll protect me.

474
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,846
I promise.

475
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,650
I hope you know
what you're doing with these wildlings.

476
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,004
I need those ships.

477
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,204
You'll get them back, I swear it.

478
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,082
Have a safe journey, Your Grace.

479
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,169
And thank you.

480
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,923
Mount up!

481
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,604
Colors!

482
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,286
No.

483
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,721
You're still too weak.

484
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:25,680
How long have I been here?

485
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,447
Three days.

486
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,601
Ser Barristan?

487
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,325
I failed him.

488
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,962
I failed my men.

489
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,324
I failed my queen.

490
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,608
You failed no one.

491
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,921
You fought bravely.

492
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,162
You'll fight again.

493
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,490
Are you ashamed?

494
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,045
You were ambushed, outnumbered.

495
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,610
There was no way you could have known.

496
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,682
This is not why.

497
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,648
Wounded in war,

498
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,126
there is no shame for this.

499
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,083
I am ashamed

500
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,931
because when the knife go in

501
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,002
and I fall to the ground,

502
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,930
I am afraid.

503
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,603
All men fear death.

504
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,365
No, not death.

505
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,329
I fear

506
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:45,084
I never again see Missandei
from the Island of Naath.

507
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,930
Now you have given the Masters
what they deserve.

508
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,322
If I give everyone what they deserve,
I'll have no one left to rule.

509
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,964
Ser Barristan counseled mercy
when I took this city,

510
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,883
right up to the morning he died.

511
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,891
Daario Naharis thinks
I should kill the former Masters,

512
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,088
and let the rest of the city fend for itself.

513
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,000
What do you think?

514
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:47,084
Your Grace, I am not fit to have
an opinion on these matters.

515
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,447
You are as fit as anyone I know.

516
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,527
You know why I'm here,

517
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,410
and who will suffer the most
if this all falls apart.

518
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,167
So, what do you think?

519
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,323
I can only tell you what I have seen,
Your Grace.

520
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,769
I have seen you listen to your counselors.

521
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,007
I have seen you lean on their experience
when your own was lacking,

522
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,443
and weigh the choices they put before you.

523
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,088
And I have seen you ignore your counselors

524
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,285
because there was a better choice.

525
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,362
One that only you could see.

526
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,490
My queen, please do not do this.

527
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,768
What about "Valar Morghulis"?

528
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,286
I did not want to die a coward.

529
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,930
Apparently I do not want to die at all.

530
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,008
It takes courage to admit fear.

531
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,687
And to admit a mistake.

532
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,761
I came here to tell you that I was wrong.

533
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,291
I was wrong, and you were right.

534
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,002
About tradition.

535
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,611
About bringing the people
of this city together.

536
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,889
I will reopen the fighting pits.

537
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,769
To free men only.

538
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,846
Slavery will never return to Meereen,
not while I live.

539
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,122
Yes, my queen.

540
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,286
And in order to forge a lasting bond
with the Meereenese people,

541
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,961
I will marry the leader of an ancient family.

542
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,211
Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees.

543
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,365
Don't worry.

544
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,769
I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think.

545
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,765
Where are we now?

546
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,208
Not the Rhoyne.

547
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,566
Long, sullen silences

548
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,564
and an occasional punch in the face.

549
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,081
The Mormont way.

550
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,925
Let's start over.

551
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,760
I apologize for before.

552
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,605
My mouth sometimes runs away from me.

553
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,287
This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip.

554
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,723
We're going to be spending
a lot of time together on the way to Meereen.

555
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,801
We are.

556
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,844
What would make our time together
truly enjoyable

557
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,325
would be some wine.

558
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,641
No wine.

559
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:33,007
I am a person who drinks.

560
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,201
People who drink need to keep drinking.

561
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,930
Otherwise, they're not...

562
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,091
I know where we are.

563
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,402
You're taking us through Valyria.

564
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,047
I am.

565
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,245
Have you sailed this route before?

566
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,321
No.

567
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,650
You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir

568
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,882
from her ancestral homeland
in case I'm not enough?

569
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,768
I think you'll be plenty.

570
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,722
You know what they say.

571
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,727
The Doom still rules Valyria.

572
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,847
What about the demons and the flames?

573
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,969
Aren't you afraid of the Doom?

574
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,441
No.

575
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,601
But the pirates are.

576
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,241
Oh.

577
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,682
The Smoking Sea.

578
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:32,331
How many centuries before we learn
how to build cities like this again?

579
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,205
For thousands of years, the Valyrians were

580
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,363
the best in the world at almost everything.

581
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,611
And then...

582
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,810
And then they weren't.

583
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,570
And then they weren't.

584
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,931
"They held each other close
And turned their backs upon the end

585
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,931
"The hills that split asunder
And the black that ate the skies

586
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:03,811
"The flames that shot so high and hot
That even dragons burned

587
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,970
"Would never be the final sights
That fell upon their eyes

588
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,443
"A fly upon a wall

589
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:15,360
"The waves the sea wind
Whipped and churned"

590
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,091
"A city of a thousand years

591
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,282
"And all that men had learned

592
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,967
"The Doom consumed it all alike

593
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,282
"And neither of them turned"

594
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,446
I would clap.

595
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,802
I suppose this is it, then.

596
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,408
This is what remains.

597
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,081
What was that?

598
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,681
Stone men!

599
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,684
Don't let them touch you!

600
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,650
Get behind!

601
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,210
Mormont, cut me free!

602
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,361
Mormont!

603
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,371
Mormont!

604
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,240
Mormont!

605
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,720
Tyrion.

606
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,085
Tyrion.

607
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,010
Tyrion.

608
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,610
Tyrion.

609
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,284
You're all right.

610
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,849
You're heavier than you look.

611
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,603
Did any of them touch you?

612
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,200
You?

613
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,763
I've seen greyscale before.

614
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,126
Nothing like that.

615
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,041
I suppose that's why
they send them there.

616
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,562
It'd be kinder to put daggers
in their hearts and be done with it.

617
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,405
Thank you for saving me.

618
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,001
Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving
if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place.

619
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,769
So, what now?

620
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:13,686
We walk up the coast.
With luck, we'll find a fishing village.

621
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,840
Maybe another boat.

622
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,685
Without luck?

623
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,641
We've got a long walk ahead of us.

624
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,606
I'll get some wood for a fire.

625
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,725
Try to get some rest, huh?

626
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,328
That's the best idea you've had all day.

627
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:43,500
<b><font color=#0E7521>Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,924
What are they doing with the bodies?

3
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,684
Get back to work.

4
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,371
No. I've been here for weeks.

5
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,650
I'm not scrubbing one more corpse
until you tell me why I'm doing it.

6
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,768
You will know why.

7
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,049
- When?
- When it's time, not before.

8
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,246
Get back to work.

9
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,210
- When do I get to play the game?
- Game?

10
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,090
The game. The Game of Faces.

11
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,491
You tried already. You failed.

12
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,686
I didn't even know I was playing.

13
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,364
Who are you?

14
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,841
No one.

15
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,601
Get back to work.

16
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,126
Who are you?

17
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,206
What are you doing here?
How did you get here?

18
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,808
I'm from Westeros, just like you.

19
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,440
Daughter of a lord, just like you.

20
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,369
Except I was an only child.

21
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,808
Heir to his fortune.

22
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,451
My mother died.

23
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,281
My father remarried,
and his new wife gave birth to a girl.

24
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,805
My stepmother didn't want any rivals
for her precious daughter,

25
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,202
so she tried to kill me with poison.

26
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,330
I found out.

27
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,607
Sought help from the Faceless Men.

28
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,766
And my father was widowed again.

29
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,642
I've been serving them ever since.

30
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,129
Was that true or a lie?

31
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,161
What?

32
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,208
Did you believe every word I said?

33
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,441
Get back to work.

34
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,368
Who are you?

35
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,605
Who are you?

36
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,121
Arya.

37
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,602
And where did you come from?

38
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,841
Westeros.

39
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,209
My family home is Winterfell.

40
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,927
I'm the youngest daughter of a great lord,
Eddard Stark.

41
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,481
He died in battle.

42
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,246
A lie.

43
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,369
After he was executed, I fled the capital.

44
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,609
Had to kill a stable boy.

45
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,205
Drove my sword through his back.

46
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,287
A lie.

47
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,491
I stabbed him in the gut.

48
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,647
I tried to find my mother and brother,
but I never did.

49
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,041
They were murdered by Walder Frey.

50
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,806
An outlaw kidnapped me,
a man called Polliver.

51
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,082
A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane.

52
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,602
He tried to sell me,
but was wounded in a fight.

53
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,208
He begged me to kill him, but I wouldn't.
I left him in the mountains to die.

54
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,807
I wanted him to suffer. I hated him.

55
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,567
I hated him.

56
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,890
That's not a lie!

57
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,244
A girl lies to me,

58
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,722
to the Many-Faced God, to herself.

59
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,968
Does she truly want to be no one?

60
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,081
Yes.

61
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,044
I'm not playing this stupid game anymore!

62
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,163
We never stop playing.

63
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,127
So, those villages we were supposed to find?

64
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,009
We can't live on berries and roots.

65
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,081
I can.

66
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,206
You're not hungry?

67
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,411
Of course I'm hungry.

68
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,521
You're an awful traveling companion,
do you know that?

69
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,489
Possibly the least charming
man I've ever met.

70
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,130
I'm not your traveling companion.

71
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,522
We are traveling together
in each other's company, therefore...

72
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,011
Do you ever shut up?

73
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,884
I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos
in a crate

74
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,846
without ever saying a word.

75
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,921
Why?

76
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,290
It never occurred to you
to ask why until now?

77
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,969
You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister
decided to visit a brothel in Volantis?

78
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,323
I'm sure you visited many brothels
in many cities.

79
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,921
I killed my father.

80
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,042
He wanted to execute me
for a crime I didn't commit.

81
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,682
And he was fucking the woman I loved.

82
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,723
As miserable as you are, Mormont,
at least your father was a good man.

83
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,290
What do you know about my father?

84
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,011
I met him. I visited the Wall.

85
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,087
When I asked him about his men,

86
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,441
he knew all their stories, every one of them.

87
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,969
He actually cared about the people
under his command.

88
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,251
How do they put it in the Watch?

89
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,971
"We shall never see his like again."

90
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,209
Oh, you didn't know.

91
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,571
I'm sorry. I am.

92
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,407
How?

93
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,931
I only know what I heard.

94
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,281
How?

95
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,601
He was leading
an expedition beyond the Wall.

96
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,530
There was a mutiny.

97
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,450
He was murdered by his own men.

98
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,810
We better keep moving.

99
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,520
Valar Morghulis.

100
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,490
Valar Dohaeris.

101
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,284
I have nowhere else to go.

102
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,926
I've taken her to every healer in Braavos.

103
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,281
I've spent every penny I had.

104
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,125
She suffers every day of her life.

105
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,004
I just want it to end.

106
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,845
It hurts.

107
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,087
I know.

108
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,124
Don't be afraid.

109
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,003
I used to be like you.

110
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,165
I was sick.

111
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,090
I was dying.

112
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,526
But my father never gave up on me.

113
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,524
He loved me

114
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,246
more than anything in the world,
just like your father loves you.

115
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,690
So he brought me here.

116
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,091
My father prayed to the Many-Faced God,

117
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,049
and I drank the water from his fountain.

118
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,484
It healed me.

119
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,367
I've devoted my life to him now.

120
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,048
You don't want to hurt anymore?

121
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,800
Drink.

122
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,050
Is a girl ready?

123
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,564
To give up her ears, her nose, her tongue?

124
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,051
Her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates?

125
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,930
All that makes a girl who she is?

126
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,930
Forever?

127
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,000
No.

128
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,926
A girl is not ready to become no one.

129
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,081
But she is ready to become someone else.

130
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,763
Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this?

131
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,806
As I recall,

132
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,208
the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens
during Robert's Rebellion.

133
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,728
Do you believe in anything?

134
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,040
I believe in lots of things.

135
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,043
In something greater than ourselves, I mean.

136
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,248
The gods, destiny.

137
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,651
Do you believe there's a plan for this world?

138
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,042
- No.
- Neither did I.

139
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,566
I was a cynic, just like you.

140
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,085
Then I saw a girl step into a great fire
with three stone eggs.

141
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,803
When the fire burned out,
I thought I'd find her blackened bones.

142
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,846
Instead, I saw her, Daenerys,

143
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,891
alive and unhurt, holding her baby dragons.

144
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,960
Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?

145
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,601
No.

146
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,003
It's hard to be a cynic after that.

147
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,288
Doesn't mean she's going to be a great queen.

148
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,408
No, it doesn't.

149
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,801
The Targaryens are famously insane.

150
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,611
What if she conquers the world? Then what?

151
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,047
A thousand years of peace and prosperity?

152
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,248
First we have to conquer the world.

153
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,685
We?

154
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,001
All right, let's assume
your dreams come true.

155
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,529
She's ecstatic when
you bring her this enemy dwarf.

156
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,604
She hacks off my head
and restores your position.

157
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,366
You command her army, sail to Westeros,
defeat all your enemies,

158
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,284
and watch her climb those steps
and sit on the Iron Throne.

159
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,761
Hurrah. Long live the queen. Then what?

160
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,247
Then she rules.

161
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,168
So, a woman who has not spent
a single day of her adult life in Westeros

162
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,368
becomes the ruler of Westeros?
That's justice?

163
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,007
- She's the rightful heir.
- Why?

164
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,766
Because her father, who burned
living men for amusement, was the king?

165
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,481
- That's a slave ship.
- Why are they anchored?

166
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,325
They probably came ashore for...

167
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,805
Water.

168
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,249
Got a lot of fight in you, huh?

169
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,845
Salt mines?

170
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,723
Yeah, that or a galley slave.

171
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,809
He looks strong enough.

172
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,769
What about the dwarf?

173
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,447
Worthless.

174
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,041
Cut his throat.

175
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,646
Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait!
Let's discuss this.

176
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,165
And then chop off his cock.

177
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,331
We'll sell it for a fortune.

178
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,442
A dwarf's cock has magic powers.

179
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,846
Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, Wait!

180
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,448
You can’t just hand a dry cock to a merchant
and expect him to pay for it.

181
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,369
He has to know it came from a dwarf.

182
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,762
And how could he know
unless he sees the dwarf?

183
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,604
It will be a dwarf-sized cock.

184
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,603
Guess again.

185
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,883
The dwarf lives until we
find a cock merchant.

186
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,602
Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.

187
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,763
We're bound for Volantis, not Slaver's Bay.

188
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,326
Besides, she reopened the fighting pits.

189
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,165
I've never heard of free men
fighting in the pits.

190
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,569
The fighting pits in Meereen?

191
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,081
You're in luck, then.
You're about to be rich.

192
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,969
You are looking at one of the great warriors
in the Seven Kingdoms.

193
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,201
Him.

194
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,041
Him?

195
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,842
He's got to be 60 years old.

196
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,929
Sure, he's a bit long in the tooth,
a bit withered, been in the sun too long.

197
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,891
We can all see that.
But he is a veteran of 100 battles.

198
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,122
They wrote songs about him.

199
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,880
That true?

200
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,209
He won the tournament at Lannisport,
unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.

201
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,446
The Kingslayer.

202
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,683
Jousting. You're talking about jousting.

203
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,286
A fancy game for fancy lads.

204
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,931
The men who fight in the pits of Meereen
will swallow him whole.

205
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,571
I killed a Dothraki bloodrider
in single combat.

206
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,846
Liar.

207
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,651
It's no lie. His name was Qotho.

208
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,041
He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo.

209
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,606
Take me to Slaver's Bay,
put a sword in my hand,

210
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,886
I'll prove my worth.

211
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,083
For my children. Money.

212
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,767
Lord Baelish.

213
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,887
Yes?

214
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,408
Lancel Lannister.

215
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,529
Brother Lancel.

216
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,011
We abandon our family names.

217
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,844
That's quite a family to abandon.

218
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,090
The city has changed
since you were here last.

219
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,924
We flooded the gutters with wine,

220
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,680
smashed the false idols,

221
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,569
and set the godless on the run.

222
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,447
Well done.

223
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,328
I'm here on urgent business
for the Queen Mother.

224
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,001
Should I send word that I'll be delayed?

225
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,730
Step carefully, Lord Baelish.

226
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,691
You'll find there's little tolerance for
flesh peddlers in the new King's Landing.

227
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,730
We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel.

228
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,246
Mine just happen to be entertaining.

229
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,331
Do you think it's wise, Your Grace,

230
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,565
arresting the heir to Highgarden?

231
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,405
The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.

232
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,529
Of course, and the Faith
were armed on your orders.

233
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,290
The king's orders.

234
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,488
Is the king to blame
for Ser Loras' perversion?

235
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,483
House Tyrell won't tolerate this insult.

236
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,808
House Tyrell won't tolerate it?

237
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,728
I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish.

238
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,327
Ser Loras was promised to me.
Instead, he chose the company of boys.

239
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,687
One's choice of companion is a curious thing.

240
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,001
Most curious.

241
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,602
Lysa Arryn, for instance.

242
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,444
A thoroughly repellant woman.

243
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,330
Forgive me.

244
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,763
I know you're still in mourning.

245
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,570
Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.

246
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,291
She was neither of those things.
We both know it.

247
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,169
Still, I pity her son.

248
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,209
How fortunate the young Lord of the Vale
has a new father to counsel him.

249
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,521
I know how hard it can be

250
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,967
to lose both your parents
at such a young age.

251
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,010
If war comes to Westeros, will the
Knights of the Vale fight for their king?

252
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,606
Young Lord Robin heeds my advice,

253
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,564
and I have always counseled
loyalty to the throne.

254
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,211
Good.

255
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,525
If there's nothing else.

256
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,690
There is another matter, Your Grace.

257
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,286
Something so urgent
I couldn't trust the words to a raven.

258
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,251
You once charged me with finding Arya Stark.

259
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,363
To my shame, I failed you.

260
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,409
But I have found Sansa Stark.

261
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,842
Alive and well and home again

262
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,001
living at Winterfell.

263
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,289
That's not possible.

264
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,647
My sources are well placed.

265
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,489
They tell me Roose Bolton
plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay,

266
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,040
a bastard recently legitimized
by King Tommen.

267
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,847
Roose Bolton is Warden of the North
by the grace of my father.

268
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,891
Indeed, his reward
for stabbing his own king in the heart.

269
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,481
We were fools to trust a turncloak.

270
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,526
Marrying his son to the last of the Starks
gives him more legitimacy in the North

271
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,762
than an alliance with a hated southern house.

272
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,166
I will skin him and his bastard
like that wretch on their bloody sigil.

273
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,890
I would counsel patience, Your Grace.

274
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,485
Patience?

275
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,691
Sansa helped murder my son.
Roose Bolton is a traitor.

276
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,646
Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor,
marching with his army on Winterfell.

277
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,646
Let Stannis and Roose battle.

278
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,563
Let the enemies of the throne
slaughter each other.

279
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,361
And when they're done, seize Winterfell
from whichever thief survives.

280
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,002
Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here.
The weather has already begun to turn.

281
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,529
That is why it is critical to strike soon,
while the victor still licks his wounds.

282
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,407
Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force.

283
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,723
My Uncle Kevan has all the courage
of a kitchen mouse.

284
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,165
Ser Jaime, then.

285
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,084
Jaime's away
on a sensitive diplomatic mission.

286
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,927
I have no idea when he'll be back.

287
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,650
Perhaps I can help.

288
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,882
The Knights of the Vale
are some of the best fighters in Westeros,

289
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,928
trained to battle in the ice and the snow.

290
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,968
Forgive me, Lord Baelish,

291
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,648
you have a reputation as a moneylender
and a brothel keeper, not a military man.

292
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,203
You wouldn't risk a single Lannister soldier
or a single coin from the royal treasury.

293
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,280
What do you have to lose?

294
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,689
A brothel keeper?

295
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,280
And if you succeed?

296
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,408
Name me Warden of the North.

297
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,328
I'll speak to the king this evening,

298
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,562
have him issue a royal decree.

299
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,605
I'll not rest until the
lion flies over Winterfell.

300
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,887
I'll know you're a man of your word

301
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,804
when I see Sansa Stark's head on a spike.

302
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,927
As I said,

303
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,849
I live to serve.

304
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,526
I'm going to ask him tomorrow.

305
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,843
- What if he says no?
- He won't.

306
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,764
We've waited long enough.

307
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,801
I want you to be my wife.

308
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,291
Now.

309
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,767
What is it?

310
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,643
Do you want to marry me
because our families arranged it?

311
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,051
Or do you...

312
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,441
We can't. Not yet.

313
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,567
Why not?

314
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,762
You know why not. Someone will see.

315
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,207
You are going to be my wife.

316
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:51,080
I am going to be your husband.

317
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,086
We're allowed
to walk through the gardens together.

318
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,683
How many other girls
have you walked through these gardens?

319
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,366
I like the way your eyes go squinty
when you're jealous.

320
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,966
They do not go squinty,
and you didn't answer the question.

321
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,208
They make a lovely couple.

322
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,881
A Lannister and a Martell.

323
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,889
They have no idea how dangerous that is.

324
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,329
We must protect them.

325
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,289
Yes, my prince.

326
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,770
You haven't had to use
that ax of yours in a long time.

327
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,165
I hope you remember how.

328
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,763
I remember how.

329
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,401
The Dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun

330
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,451
And her kisses were warmer than spring

331
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,690
The Dornishman's blade
It was made of black steel

332
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,809
And its kiss was a terrible thing

333
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,007
The Dornishman's wife
Would sing as she bathed

334
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,887
In a voice that was sweet as a peach...

335
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,564
All right, that's enough.

336
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,404
I'm coming to the best part.

337
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,528
We're trying to blend in.

338
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,409
Don't want everyone in Dorne
to hear your accent.

339
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,209
This song really is all about the ending.

340
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,681
It can wait. There.

341
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,885
That's the Water Gardens.

342
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,531
And once we've got the princess,
then what?

343
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,770
I like to improvise.

344
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,161
That explains the golden hand.

345
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,720
Unbowed. Unbent. Unbroken.

346
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,681
For Oberyn.

347
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,367
For Oberyn.

348
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,681
Well, she's made herself at home.

349
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,491
Myrcella.

350
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,091
Uncle Jaime?

351
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,881
I...

352
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,889
I don't understand. What are you doing here?

353
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,450
Let's speak in private.

354
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,885
I am Trystane Martell.

355
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,211
Trystane is my intended.

356
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,769
Excellent. Good to meet you.

357
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,610
We weren't expecting you, Lord Jaime.

358
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,684
Why don't you let them
have some time alone, son?

359
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,284
Let's not do something stupid.

360
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,721
That was something stupid.

361
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,370
We have to go, Myrcella, now.

362
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,527
You hurt him!

363
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,204
He'll be fine, I promise. But we have to...

364
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,481
Oh, for fuck's sake.

365
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,167
Take her!

366
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,525
- You're coming with me.
- I don't want to.

367
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,523
I wasn't asking, princess.

368
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,171
Drop your weapons!

369
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,727
I am Obara Sand.

370
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,564
Daughter of Oberyn Martell.

371
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,290
I fight for Dorne. Who do you fight for?

372
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,328
Drop your weapons.

373
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,563
When you were whole,
it would have been a good fight.

374
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,323
You fight pretty good for a little girl.

375
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,611
Halt!

376
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,527
Oh.

377
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,887
You can smell the shit from five miles away.

378
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,131
Well, why have we stopped? Go on.

379
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,205
Rumors and gossip, that's all they've got.

380
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,203
It's theater, nothing more.

381
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,648
If they arrested
all the pillow biters in King's Landing,

382
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,530
there'd be no room left in the dungeons
for anyone else.

383
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,329
Everyone knew about him and Renly.

384
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,967
Renly Baratheon shagged
half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms.

385
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,804
Everyone knew, no one cared.

386
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,245
But he was the king's brother.

387
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,209
And Loras is the queen's brother.

388
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,647
No, no, no, no. This is unacceptable.

389
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,047
- Cersei's behind it.
- Yes, of course she is.

390
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:31,125
She wants to drag our name through the dirt,
put us in our place.

391
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,123
Get some rest, dear. You look appalling.

392
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,328
And let me deal with Cersei Lannister.

393
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,009
Your Grace, I have traveled a long way.

394
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,524
You must be exhausted.

395
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,123
Put the pen down, dear.
We both know you're not writing anything.

396
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,124
Ah, yes. The famously tart-tongued
Queen of Thorns.

397
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,204
And the famous tart, Queen Cersei.

398
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,726
I beg your pardon?

399
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,202
I know you're behind
this absurd incarceration of my grandson.

400
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,762
If you apologize for that comment,
perhaps I'll...

401
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,684
You'll get your apology when I get Loras.

402
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,090
I was as shocked as anyone
when the Faith arrested Ser Loras.

403
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,087
I have no love for these fanatics,

404
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,731
but what can a Queen Mother do?

405
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,087
Has the crown suddenly stopped needing

406
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,323
the troops, gold,
and wheat my house supplies?

407
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,490
I can assure you,
our alliance with House Tyrell remains...

408
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,884
Do you expect the alliance to continue
after you've thrown our future into prison?

409
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,246
As I said,

410
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,642
I didn't imprison anyone.

411
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,324
As for your veiled threats...

412
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,561
What veil?

413
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:54,488
The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace
to a war-torn country.

414
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,723
Do you really want to see
the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?

415
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,570
I didn't trust your father.

416
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,527
I didn't particularly like him.

417
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,803
But I respected him. He was no fool.

418
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,442
He understood that sometimes
we must work with our rivals

419
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,090
rather than destroy them.

420
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,248
House Lannister has no rival.

421
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,242
The High Septon has called for an inquest,
not a trial.

422
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,848
Just a small hearing to determine
whether the charges against Loras have merit,

423
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,843
which I'm sure they don't.

424
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,208
Loras will be freed,
our happy alliance will continue,

425
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,009
and we'll forget
this unfortunate conversation ever happened.

426
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,320
Good day, Lady Olenna.

427
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,963
You are aware of
the rumors concerning you and Renly?

428
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,560
I don't pay attention to rumors.

429
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,723
You were said
to be despondent when he died.

430
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,364
Witnesses state that you
refused to leave his bedside,

431
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,011
even as Stannis' army closed in.

432
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,720
He was my friend.

433
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,841
He was my king.

434
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,490
Wasn't Joffrey your king?

435
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,571
He was anointed by the Seven, not Renly.

436
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,208
I was wrong to support
Renly's claim, I know that.

437
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,164
But I was forgiven by Joffrey.

438
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,082
I fought for him at the Battle of Blackwater.

439
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,091
Yes, wearing Renly's armor.

440
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,685
Why does it matter what I wore?

441
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,445
Do you deny all the charges against you?

442
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,567
Fornication.

443
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,241
Buggery. Blasphemy.

444
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,731
Of course I deny them.

445
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,768
You never lay with Renly Baratheon?

446
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,566
Never.

447
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,804
Nor any other man?

448
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,521
Never.

449
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,971
That will be all, Ser Loras.

450
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,567
Well, I think that's quite enough of that.

451
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,206
The Faith calls Queen Margaery forward.

452
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,201
You call me forward?

453
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,647
Yes, we have some questions for you.

454
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,565
- I am the queen.
- You are.

455
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,241
And according to the law of the Seven,

456
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:32,804
neither kings nor queens are exempt
from testimony at a holy inquest.

457
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,207
How do you respond to
these charges against your brother?

458
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,170
They are lies.

459
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,605
- All of them?
- All of them.

460
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,931
Queen Margaery,

461
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,527
in the presence of the gods,
do you swear that your brother is innocent

462
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,649
of these charges against him,
to the best of your knowledge?

463
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,685
Yes, I swear it.

464
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,962
Thank you, Your Grace.

465
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,930
Do you know this man?

466
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,801
Yes.

467
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,651
Very well.

468
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,765
He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden.

469
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,730
How did you come to meet?

470
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,488
I squired for him.

471
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,450
He took a liking to me.

472
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,807
He summoned me to his chamber
the first day we met.

473
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,084
And what occurred in his chamber?

474
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,643
We engaged in intimate relations.

475
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,005
You lay with him?

476
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,366
That night and many others.

477
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,841
Liar. He's a liar.

478
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,248
Is there anyone else
who can support your claim?

479
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,650
Yes.

480
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,331
Yes, Queen Margaery.

481
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,969
She walked in on us once, not long ago.

482
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,044
She didn't seem surprised.

483
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,890
This testimony is an insult to a great house.

484
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,005
Why should the Faith or anyone else

485
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,289
take the word of a squire
over the heir to Highgarden?

486
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,488
He has a birthmark, Your Grace.

487
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,002
Quite high on his thigh.

488
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,524
Wine-colored
and roughly the shape of Dorne.

489
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,485
No! Liar!

490
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,723
What are you doing? Let us pass.

491
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,406
The Faith is satisfied
there is enough evidence

492
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,244
to bring a formal trial

493
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,450
for Ser Loras

494
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,371
and Queen Margaery.

495
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,771
What?

496
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,409
Bearing false witness before the gods
is as grave a sin as any, my lady.

497
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,887
Take her.

498
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,685
No.

499
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,121
Tommen.

500
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,367
Tommen!

501
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,127
You can't do this. I am the queen.

502
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,801
Tommen! Tommen!

503
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,884
I am your queen. How dare you?
Take your hands off me!

504
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,449
Tommen!

505
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,087
What do you want?

506
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,929
Lord Ramsay sent me
to draw your bath, my lady.

507
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,931
You want to be clean and fresh
for your new husband, don't you?

508
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,324
You're so beautiful,

509
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,804
but you need to keep him happy.

510
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,601
Ramsay gets bored easily.

511
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,245
You don't want to end up like...

512
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,966
Well, like the others.

513
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,490
What others?

514
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,960
I shouldn't gossip.

515
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,490
Oh, it's good to see the red again.

516
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,245
No point hiding anymore.

517
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,810
What others?

518
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:48,681
Let's see, there was Kyra,
the blacksmith's daughter.

519
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,286
She was tall like you, lovely figure.

520
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:55,809
But she talked and talked and talked,

521
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,088
and Ramsay grew tired of that.

522
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,409
Then there was Violet.

523
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,131
She had gorgeous blonde hair.

524
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,090
But she got pregnant.

525
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,010
And, well, that was boring.

526
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,766
Then Tansy.

527
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,649
Such a sweet girl.

528
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:20,681
Of course, sweet girls get a bit dull

529
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,728
after a while, don't they?

530
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,207
Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt.

531
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,486
Hunt?

532
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,721
Mmm.

533
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,886
Have you ever seen a body
after the dogs have been at it?

534
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,604
Not so pretty.

535
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,207
But, well, it's your wedding day.

536
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,321
Why am I talking about such things?

537
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,290
What was your name again?

538
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,885
Myranda.

539
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,884
And how long have you loved him, Myranda?

540
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,365
Did you imagine that he would
be with you forever, is that it?

541
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,329
And I came along and ruined it.

542
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,325
I'm Sansa Stark of Winterfell.

543
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:14,291
This is my home, and you can't frighten me.

544
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,927
Are you done with your bath, my lady?

545
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,411
Go. I can finish on my own.

546
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,406
Yes?

547
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,091
I've come to escort you
to the godswood, my lady.

548
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,730
If you please, my lady, will you take my arm?

549
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,881
No.

550
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,811
Lord Ramsay, he said I'm to take your arm.

551
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,166
I'm not touching you.

552
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,811
Please.

553
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,211
He'll punish me.

554
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,806
You think I care what he does to you?

555
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,801
Who comes before the Old Gods this night?

556
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,084
Sansa of the House Stark

557
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,250
comes here to be wed.

558
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:04,245
A woman grown, trueborn and noble.

559
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,891
She comes to beg the blessings of the gods.

560
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,251
Who comes to claim her?

561
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,164
Ramsay of House Bolton.

562
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,848
Heir to the Dreadfort and Winterfell.

563
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,290
Who gives her?

564
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:39,242
Theon of House Greyjoy, who was...

565
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,404
Who was her father's ward.

566
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:51,128
Lady Sansa, will you take this man?

567
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,084
I take this man.

568
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,529
Are you pleased, my lady?

569
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,604
Good. I want you to be happy.

570
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,201
My father said you're still a virgin.

571
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,481
Uh, yes.

572
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,891
Why?

573
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,648
Why are you still a virgin?

574
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,560
Afraid of dwarves?

575
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,369
Lord Tyrion was kind.

576
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,762
He was gentle. He never touched me.

577
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,051
You're not lying to me?

578
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,006
No, my lord.

579
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,401
Lying to your husband on his wedding night,

580
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,130
that would be a bad way to start a marriage.

581
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,123
We're man and wife now.

582
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,686
We should be honest with each other.

583
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,966
Don't you think?

584
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,765
Yes.

585
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,600
Good.

586
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,765
Take off your clothes.

587
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,690
Oh, no, no, no.

588
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,524
You stay here, Reek.

589
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,965
You watch.

590
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,808
Do I need to ask a second time?

591
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,129
I hate asking a second time.

592
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,687
Reek.

593
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,843
I told you to watch.

594
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,565
You've known Sansa since she was a girl.

595
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,849
Now watch her become a woman.

596
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:23,500
<b><font color=#0E7521>Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
<b><font color=#0E7521>Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

2
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,923
You have command of Castle Black.

3
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,407
It is my duty to tell you

4
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,962
I believe this mission
to be reckless, foolhardy,

5
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,965
and an insult to all the brothers
who have died fighting the wildlings.

6
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,042
Thank you for your honesty.

7
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,204
Safe travels.

8
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,441
Thank you, Sam.

9
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,166
Oh, um...

10
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,451
It's dragonglass.

11
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,290
It's what I used to kill the White Walker.

12
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,965
I hope you don't need them.

13
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,241
Me, too.

14
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,645
There he is.

15
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,885
That laugh.

16
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,161
Egg.

17
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,764
Egg laughed like that.

18
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,605
One of the first things I remember.

19
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,601
His little brother, Aegon. He became king.

20
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,444
And before that, he was a jolly fellow,

21
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,211
like this one.

22
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,404
Get him south, Gillyflower.

23
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,961
Before it's too late.

24
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,406
Theon, wait.

25
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,721
Not Theon. Reek.

26
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,605
Help me.

27
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,450
You're his wife now.

28
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,681
Theon.

29
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,121
Do what he says,

30
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,805
or he'll hurt you.

31
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,888
He already hurts me every night.

32
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,611
All day I'm locked in this room,
and every night he comes...

33
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,086
It can't be any worse.

34
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,161
It can.

35
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,005
It can always be worse.

36
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,890
- What did he do to you?
- Please.

37
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,731
- You betrayed my family!
- I'm sorry!

38
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,041
You have to help me.

39
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,282
He'll see us. You don't know him.

40
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,090
My family still has friends in the North.

41
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,811
All I need to do is give a signal,
and they'll rescue me.

42
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,283
Climb to the top of the broken tower.

43
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,843
Light this candle, and put it in the window.

44
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,810
- Promise me, Theon.
- My name is Reek.

45
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,086
Your name is Theon Greyjoy.

46
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,360
Last surviving son of Balon Greyjoy,
Lord of the Iron Islands.

47
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,930
Do you hear me?

48
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,206
Theon.

49
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,407
Promise me.

50
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,280
Yes, Reek?

51
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,891
Egg.

52
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,486
Egg.

53
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,442
Mother's looking for you.

54
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,326
Egg.

55
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,365
Get some sleep, Sam.

56
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,729
You'll have to speak for him tomorrow.

57
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,251
You don't know that.

58
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,651
Get some sleep.

59
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,450
I'll watch over him.

60
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,051
I'm staying, too.

61
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,129
He's always been good to me.

62
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,885
I can't leave him now.

63
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,651
Egg!

64
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,721
Egg,

65
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,445
I dreamed

66
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,286
that I was old.

67
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,167
His name was Aemon Targaryen.

68
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,164
He came to us from King's Landing.

69
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,690
A maester of the Citadel, chained and sworn,

70
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,851
and sworn brother of the Night's Watch,
ever faithful.

71
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,170
No man was wiser, or gentler, or kinder.

72
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,011
At the Wall,

73
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,081
a dozen lord commanders
came and went during his years of service,

74
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,128
but he was always there to counsel them.

75
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,284
He was the blood of the dragon,

76
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,203
but now his fire has gone out.

77
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,970
And now his watch is ended.

78
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,488
And now his watch is ended.

79
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,686
You're losing all your friends, Tarly.

80
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,930
My beautiful wife.

81
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,767
When my father told me we were marrying,
I half expected a fat, bearded beast.

82
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,411
Do you know how pleased I was
when I saw you?

83
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,962
You've made me very happy.

84
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,968
Our scouts report
that Stannis Baratheon rides for Winterfell.

85
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,764
He's a respected commander.

86
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,322
His troops are loyal and battle-tested.

87
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,882
He's hired thousands of foreign sellswords
to bolster his army.

88
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,803
But this storm is a stroke of luck
for us northerners.

89
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,720
Our people are used to fighting in the frost.

90
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,525
His army is out there now,
suffering in the snow.

91
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,849
One day I'll be Lord of Winterfell
and Warden of the North.

92
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,287
You'll be my lady and Wardeness.

93
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,522
But isn't your stepmother pregnant?

94
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,161
What of it?

95
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,408
What happens if she has a boy?

96
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,723
Then I'll have a baby brother.

97
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,251
But he'll be the heir.

98
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,288
I'm Lord Bolton's eldest son.

99
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,121
But you're a bastard.

100
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,521
A trueborn will always
have the stronger claim.

101
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,480
I've been naturalized by
a royal decree from...

102
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,846
Tommen Baratheon?

103
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,726
Another bastard.

104
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,246
Bastards can rise high in the world.

105
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,844
Like your half-brother, Jon Snow.

106
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,723
Born the Bastard of Winterfell,

107
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,406
now the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

108
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,365
You didn't know?

109
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,441
Yes, he's done very well for himself.

110
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,401
Ch.

111
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,168
I nearly forgot why I asked you to join me.

112
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,006
Come, my lady.

113
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,130
Your northern friend.

114
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,608
Reek told me you wanted to leave.

115
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,931
Why?

116
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,731
Winterfell is your home,
and I am your husband.

117
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,486
Tough old bird.

118
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,441
Everyone talks when I start peeling them.

119
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,961
But this one,

120
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,400
her heart gave out
before I even got to her face.

121
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,681
We do breed them tough in the North.

122
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,122
Bring my wife back to her chamber.

123
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,968
It's far too cold out here for a lady.

124
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,042
You should hold on to your candles.

125
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,167
The nights are so long now.

126
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,247
Forty horses died in the night.

127
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,283
We'll lose more come sunset.

128
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,806
We're running out of food.

129
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,526
We can't open the supply line
until the snow clears.

130
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,001
What else?

131
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,891
The Stormcrows rode off last night.

132
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,931
Five hundred men.

133
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,480
Sellswords.

134
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,723
Loyal to nothing but gold.

135
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,729
We still have a hard march to Winterfell,

136
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,609
and we won't be marching anywhere
in this weather.

137
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,321
And?

138
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,890
This isn't our time.

139
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,490
We should head back to Castle Black
when the snow clears.

140
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,927
I retreated from King's Landing.

141
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,402
If I retreat again,
I'll become the King Who Ran.

142
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,608
- Your Grace...
- Winter is coming.

143
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,843
Those aren't just the Stark words.
It's a fact.

144
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,721
If we march back to Castle Black,
we winter at Castle Black.

145
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,646
And who can say how many years
this winter will last?

146
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,643
It's better to wait for the right time
than risk everything.

147
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,041
This is the right time,
and I will risk everything.

148
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,521
Because if I don't, we've lost.

149
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,771
We march to victory, or we march to defeat,

150
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,921
but we go forward. Only forward.

151
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,281
Your Grace.

152
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,127
I've trusted in your visions,

153
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,965
in your prophecies for years.

154
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,926
You saw it yourself,
when you stared into the flames.

155
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,244
A great battle in the snow.

156
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,209
- I don't know what I saw.
- You do know.

157
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,601
Trust yourself.

158
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,804
And you? Do you trust yourself?

159
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,131
I trust in the Lord.

160
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,330
Are you sure?

161
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,002
I have seen myself
walk along the battlements of Winterfell.

162
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,321
I have seen the flayed man banners
lowered to the ground.

163
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,122
But sometimes sacrifices must be made
to ensure victory.

164
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,727
I have shown you the power of king's blood.

165
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,131
The usurper, Robb Stark.

166
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,449
The usurper, Joffrey Baratheon.

167
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,841
We don't have Robert's bastard here.

168
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,921
No,

169
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,880
we have someone better,

170
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,321
and your blood runs through her veins.

171
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,045
Have you lost your mind?

172
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,690
Do you doubt me?

173
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,405
Still?

174
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,885
After all that you've seen.

175
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,930
There must be another way.

176
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,401
- Leeches or...
- There is only one way.

177
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,690
You must become king
before the Long Night begins.

178
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,401
Only you can lead the
living against the dead.

179
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,285
All your life has led us to this moment.

180
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,769
- To this decision.
- She's my daughter.

181
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,647
Get out.

182
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,329
There's always some sort of grub on.

183
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,004
A bit of mutton would be nice.

184
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,610
A beauty from beyond the Wall.

185
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,771
Where you going, love?
Aren't we better-looking than the fat man?

186
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,844
No, the question is,
"Is she pretty down south in the real world,

187
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,888
"or is she pretty
'cause she's the only girl here?"

188
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,809
Even in White Harbor, I'd want a kiss.

189
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,684
Come on, love, give us a kiss.

190
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,807
Leave me alone.

191
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,769
Oh, if you were my girl,
I wouldn't leave you alone.

192
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,330
- One little kiss.
- Come on, give him a kiss.

193
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,170
A man gets lonely guarding the Wall.

194
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,601
There's no need to be rude.

195
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,286
We just want a little affection.

196
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,641
Ooh.

197
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,801
Get your hands off her.

198
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,446
Brother Derek, Brother Brant,

199
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,484
I believe you both have guard duty tonight.

200
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,170
Sam the Slayer.

201
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,850
You gonna slay me with that sword?

202
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,331
Look at his hand shake.

203
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,289
Gilly, go on.

204
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,489
Get back to your room, lock the door.

205
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,048
- I'm warning you.
- Come on.

206
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,167
Come on.

207
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,161
Sam!

208
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,008
You lying sack of shit.

209
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,403
Killed a White Walker, eh?

210
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,686
You fat-ass fuck.

211
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,683
Come on, get up.

212
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,051
- No!
- This your hero? This hog?

213
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,841
Leave him alone!

214
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,641
Stubborn little wildling bitch, aren't you?

215
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,085
- Come on!
- No!

216
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,890
- Sam!
- Come on!

217
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,762
- Sam!
- Come on.

218
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,001
Right.

219
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,411
Hold still.

220
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,760
- Turn her over.
- All right.

221
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,691
I said, get your hands off her.

222
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,285
You're gonna get yourself killed.

223
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,806
Your lover Jon Snow's not here to save you.

224
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,451
I killed a White Walker, I killed a Thenn.

225
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,170
I'll take my chances with you.

226
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,081
Sam!

227
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,449
- I'm all right.
- You're not.

228
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,725
Just a bit woozy.

229
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,491
The next time you see something like that,
you leave it alone.

230
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,370
I will not. They would have...

231
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,568
I don't know what they would have done.

232
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,961
I know they would have killed you
if Ghost hadn't come.

233
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,249
No. They were tiring out.

234
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,928
I had them in the palm of my hand.

235
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,409
Don't be stupid. You're not a fighter.

236
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,725
What kind of man would I be

237
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,808
if I ran away
when I saw someone hurting you?

238
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,920
Just promise me,

239
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,810
whatever happens,
you'll take care of Little Sam.

240
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,730
But of course I will.

241
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,601
And

242
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,609
I'll take care of you, too.

243
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,810
I need more water.

244
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,806
Stay.

245
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,764
Please.

246
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,450
Am I hurting you?

247
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,847
Are you sure?

248
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,691
Oh, my!

249
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,764
A rare find for the fighting pits,
my friend.

250
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,449
Not your usual street
tough or drunken pirate.

251
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,766
This one's a Westerosi knight

252
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,211
from an ancient house
trained in sword and lance.

253
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,089
He fought beside the stag king Robert
on the far side of the Narrow Sea.

254
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,522
He was first through the breach
during the Siege of Spike,

255
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,888
slaughtering 50 men with his flaming sword.

256
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,681
He killed the great Khal Drogo
in single combat.

257
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,204
Betrayed by his woman,

258
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,682
he sold himself into slavery
to repay his debts.

259
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,969
Bidding begins at 12 gold honors.

260
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,566
Thirteen. Do I have 14?

261
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,202
Fifteen? 15 gold honors.

262
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,489
Do I hear 16? 16.

263
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,324
Twenty.

264
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,846
Sold.

265
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,641
Wait!

266
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,560
- You have to buy me as well.
- Why?

267
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,245
We're a team.

268
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,924
I'm a great fighter, too.

269
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,967
He's funny. You have to give him that.

270
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,441
You're right, he's funny.

271
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,650
Thank you.

272
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,767
Yes.

273
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,288
My lord, if I may.

274
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,801
I've heard Meereen has become a free city.

275
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,645
You might run into trouble if you try
to fight slaves in the fighting pits.

276
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,848
Now, if you were to fight freed men
who'd be paid a wage...

277
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,283
There's your wages, funny man.

278
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,284
Should last the rest of your life.

279
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,760
These are warrior hands,
not a serving girl's.

280
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,130
Five, going once...

281
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,842
How long before the King of Meereen
comes to claim my pillow?

282
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,285
Don't be ridiculous.

283
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,924
My marriage to Hizdahr is political.

284
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,608
I think he's smart enough to understand that.

285
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,648
I think the Sons of the Harpy
have stopped killing

286
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,922
because their leader was made king.

287
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,570
Are you jealous?

288
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,722
Do you think I'm petty enough to
speak ill of a man

289
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,962
just because he represents competition?

290
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,126
I do.

291
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,730
You're right.

292
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,371
My motivations are entirely impure.

293
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,004
Doesn't make me wrong.

294
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,889
You told me yourself
I can't fight enemies within and without.

295
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,443
So when enemies without come knocking,
I need the city of Meereen behind me.

296
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,931
I have no choice.

297
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,325
Everyone has a choice.

298
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,364
Even slaves have a choice,

299
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,005
death or slavery.

300
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,489
So what else can I do, hmm?

301
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,925
Marry me instead.

302
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,087
Even if I wanted to do
such an inadvisable thing,

303
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,443
- I couldn't.
- Why not?

304
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,128
You are queen. You can do what you like.

305
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,330
No, I can't.

306
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,810
Then you are the only person in Meereen
who's not free.

307
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,689
And I know I'm here to serve my queen
and not give advice,

308
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,843
but can I make one more suggestion?

309
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,761
Of course.

310
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,409
On the day of the great games,

311
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:47,207
gather all the Great Masters and Wise Masters
and Worthy Masters you can find,

312
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,845
and slaughter them all.

313
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,007
I am a queen, not a butcher.

314
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,883
All rulers are either butchers or meat.

315
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,527
You there.

316
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,481
Where would I find
the High Septon, or High Sparrow,

317
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,642
or whatever bloody fool name he's got?

318
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,970
It's not as good a name as Queen of Thorns,
I'll admit.

319
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,164
You should have the decency
to stand when you speak to a lady.

320
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,481
You should have the decency
to kneel before the gods.

321
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,610
Don't spar with me, little fellow.

322
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,447
For me, it's the knees.

323
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,649
- You?
- Hips.

324
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,161
Ah.

325
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,611
A man of the people. Is that your game?

326
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,487
It's an old game. Dull and unconvincing.

327
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,011
A man of the people

328
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,331
who does Cersei's dirty work for her.

329
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,362
The people always do the dirty work.

330
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,569
Spare me the homilies.
I can smell a fraud from a mile away.

331
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,041
Useful talent.

332
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,964
I'm here for my grandson and granddaughter.

333
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,847
Your grandson and granddaughter
swore sacred vows and lied.

334
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,121
The Father judges us all.

335
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,882
Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen.

336
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,564
If you break his laws, you will be punished.

337
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,565
Don't you walk away from me.

338
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,768
You don't give commands here.

339
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,285
What is it you want?

340
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,200
Gold?

341
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,405
I'll make you the richest septon
who ever lived.

342
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,246
What, then?

343
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,488
I imagine this is strange for you.

344
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:47,566
Everyone you meet has a hidden motive,
and you pride yourself on sniffing it out.

345
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,649
But I'm telling you a simple truth.

346
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,685
I serve the gods.

347
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,883
The gods demand justice.

348
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,447
How do they communicate their demands?

349
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,126
By raven or horse?

350
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,851
By the holy text, The Seven-Pointed Star.

351
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,962
If you don't have one in your library,
I'll give you my own.

352
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,566
I've read The Seven-Pointed Star.

353
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,964
Then you'll remember the passages
concerning buggery and perjury.

354
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,283
Your grandchildren will be punished

355
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,002
in the same manner
as anyone who breaks the sacred laws.

356
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,881
Half the men, women, and children
in this foul city break the sacred laws.

357
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,329
You live among murderers,
thieves, and rapists,

358
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:33,804
and yet you punish Loras
for shagging some perfumed ponce,

359
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,042
and Margaery for defending her brother?

360
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,531
Yes.

361
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,446
The gods' laws must be
applied to all equally.

362
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,248
If it's equality you want, so be it.

363
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,285
When House Tyrell stops sending our crops
to the capital,

364
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,563
everyone here will starve.

365
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,641
And I'll make sure
the hungry know who's to blame.

366
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,531
Have you ever sowed the field?

367
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,370
Have you ever reaped the grain?

368
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,565
Has anyone in House Tyrell?

369
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,562
A lifetime of wealth and power
has left you blind in one eye.

370
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,966
You are the few,

371
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,730
we are the many.

372
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,927
And when the many stop fearing the few...

373
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,486
Lady Olenna.

374
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,321
Starving yourself won't make things
any better for her, my love.

375
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:01,287
She's in a prison cell,
and there is nothing I can do.

376
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,564
I am the king!

377
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,803
The queen is in prison,
and there is nothing I can do!

378
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,209
No matter who you are,

379
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,760
no matter how strong you are,
sooner or later,

380
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,406
you'll face circumstances
beyond your control.

381
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,170
Events you couldn't possibly have anticipated
or prevented, even if you had.

382
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,601
You cannot blame yourself for fate.

383
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,931
Your father,

384
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,571
your brother, your grandfather...

385
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,246
I was Queen of the Seven Kingdoms,
and what could I do?

386
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,844
Hold them as they left this world.

387
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,489
Kissed their heads after they'd gone.

388
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,923
I'll call in the army.

389
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,564
I'll take back the sept,
and kill every last one of them.

390
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,807
I'll start a war if I have to.

391
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,327
You know as well as I do
who the first casualty of that war would be.

392
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,726
I love her.

393
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,765
I love her,

394
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,165
and I can't help her.

395
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,723
We must be strong for those we love.
We cannot give in to despair.

396
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,847
I will speak with the High Sparrow.

397
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,640
There must be something he...

398
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,529
Let me talk to him on your behalf.

399
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,927
The king cannot sully himself
negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.

400
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,324
You will try to help her?

401
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,843
I'll do everything I can
to win her freedom and her brother's.

402
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,526
Your happiness is all I want in this world.

403
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,286
I know.

404
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,125
No, you don't.

405
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,204
You can't possibly.

406
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,328
Not until you have children of your own.

407
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,050
I would do anything for you.

408
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,204
Anything to keep you from harm.

409
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,042
I would burn cities to the ground.

410
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,684
You are all that matters.

411
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,840
You

412
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,360
and your sister.

413
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,763
From the moment you came into this world.

414
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,291
My boy.

415
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,685
My only boy.

416
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,609
Prince Doran hopes this satisfies
your concerns about the princess' well-being.

417
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,005
You looked different when I left.

418
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,928
You had more hair.

419
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,481
And more hands.

420
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,846
- How's Trystane?
- He'll be all right.

421
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,921
I'm sorry for that.

422
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,531
It wasn't supposed to happen that way.

423
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,325
Why is it happening at all?

424
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,683
Your mother's worried about you.

425
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,251
Threats have been made.
Dame's too dangerous for you.

426
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,682
- I've come to take you home.
- This is my home.

427
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,886
This has been my home for years.

428
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,767
I didn't want to come here, but she told me to.
I did what she said.

429
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,605
I did my duty,
and now she's forcing me to go back?

430
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,650
It's for your own good.
These are complicated matters.

431
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,007
No, it's not complicated at all. It's simple.

432
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,971
I love Trystane, I'm going to marry him,
and we're staying right here.

433
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,804
- I don't understand.
- Of course you don't.

434
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,441
You don't know me.

435
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,364
Brothers, oh, brothers,
my days here are done

436
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,850
The Dornishman's taken my life

437
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,844
But what does it matter
For all men must die

438
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,481
And I've tasted the Dornishman's wife

439
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,846
I have

440
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,369
I've tasted the Dornishman's wife

441
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,125
He's got a good voice.

442
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,970
We're lucky he's a singer.

443
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,327
If he were a fighter,
we might have been in trouble.

444
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,442
It's against my code to hurt a woman.

445
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,603
It's amazing how many men we beat
seem to have this code.

446
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,290
I wouldn't say you beat me.

447
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,087
How's your arm?

448
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,571
Wonderful.

449
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,006
Wouldn't feel right to leave Dome
without a new scar.

450
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,205
You think you're leaving Dome?

451
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,091
No great hurry.

452
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,086
Dornish women
are the most beautiful women in the world.

453
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,681
Thank you.

454
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,604
I said Dornish women. I didn't say you.

455
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,800
I'm not the most beautiful woman
you've ever seen?

456
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,324
I've seen quite a few women
in all the Seven Kingdoms.

457
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,645
Name one more beautiful than I am.

458
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,290
Well, now,

459
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:31,402
in King's Landing,
there was an absolutely gorgeous...

460
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,126
There was a what?

461
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,802
In King's Landing, you were saying?

462
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,607
Was I?

463
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,641
There was a woman more beautiful than I am.

464
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,491
Was there?

465
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,962
My memory's not what it was earlier.

466
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,801
How's your arm now?

467
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,651
You seem concerned with it.

468
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,650
You must really like me.

469
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,920
And how about your head?

470
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,570
My head.

471
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,765
My head?

472
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,530
You don't even want to know
what's going on in...

473
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,205
Your nose is bleeding.

474
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,205
It's nothing. It's the dry air.

475
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,968
My dagger was coated
with a special ointment from Asshai.

476
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,849
They call it the Long Farewell.

477
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,051
It takes time to work,

478
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,640
but if a single drop
makes contact with the skin,

479
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,721
death.

480
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,043
The only antidote.

481
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,481
Who's the most
beautiful woman in the world?

482
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,251
You.

483
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,565
Sorry? Who?

484
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,081
You.

485
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,407
Don't drop it.

486
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,162
I think you're very handsome as well.

487
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,606
- I'm sorry about the locale.
- No, you're not.

488
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,971
It felt like the safest place.

489
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,722
Not for your clientele, clearly.

490
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,801
It was an establishment like no other.

491
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,162
The sheer range of appetites catered to.

492
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,169
Desires that didn't even exist

493
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,650
until we invented them.

494
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,164
You've always been rather impressed
with yourself, haven't you?

495
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,165
The past is the past.

496
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,922
The future is all that's worth discussing.

497
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,045
The future of House Tyrell.

498
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,771
Don't pretend to have any concern
for my house,

499
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,569
my grandchildren, or me.

500
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,089
I should have known
you'd return to the capital

501
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,686
as soon as things started to go wrong.

502
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,967
- I promise you...
- I promise you, Lord Baelish,

503
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,890
that our fates are joined.

504
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,770
Together we murdered a king.

505
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,329
If my house should fall,
I will have nothing to hide.

506
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:33,647
And if I should meet with some accident here
at your broken little flesh market,

507
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,126
they'll never even find what's left of you.

508
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,725
So...

509
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,050
Do you deny a part in all this?

510
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,291
Cersei summoned me to King's Landing.

511
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,081
I dared not refuse her.

512
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,010
And what did she want?

513
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,726
A piece of information she knew that I had.

514
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,204
Neither silence nor lies were an option.

515
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,645
But I have other information

516
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,925
of which she is unaware.

517
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,284
And as you say, our interests are aligned.

518
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,806
I have a gift for you.

519
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,771
What kind Of gift?

520
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,770
The same kind I gave Cersei.

521
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,005
A handsome young man.

522
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:33,723
Many worthy fighters have died
trying to make it to the great games.

523
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,410
When most of you worthless scum
join them in death this afternoon,

524
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,404
it will represent a significant rise
in your station.

525
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,645
But if you do happen to triumph here,

526
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:47,964
you will fight at the Great Pit of
Daznak itself, in front of the queen.

527
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,926
So whatever happens,
the gods have smiled upon you today.

528
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:56,765
This is the day your lives
actually start to mean something.

529
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,328
You and you. You.

530
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,521
You two.

531
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,325
You, you, and you.

532
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,806
Up.

533
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,650
- Valar Morghulis.
- Valar Dohaeris.

534
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,960
Prepare yourselves.

535
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,201
Sitting through the great games
will be bad enough.

536
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,170
For generations,
in the days leading up to the great games,

537
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:37,648
it has been customary for our ruler
to make the rounds of the lower pits

538
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,041
to pay the fighters there
the honor of her presence.

539
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,520
Move yourselves.

540
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,605
Your Grace.

541
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,360
Your future Grace.

542
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,205
You honor us all.

543
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,487
Stand there.

544
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,842
Stand straight. That's the fucking queen.

545
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,489
We fight and die for your glory,

546
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,245
O glorious queen.

547
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,001
We fight and die for your glory,
O glorious queen.

548
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,005
Fight!

549
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,007
I think I've seen enough.

550
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,163
Your Grace, it is a tradition

551
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:28,164
for the queen to stay
until the victor has emerged.

552
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,044
I've sacrificed more than enough
for your traditions.

553
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,601
What are you doing?

554
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,929
Wait your turn, you piece of fucking filth.

555
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,005
Get him out of my sight.

556
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,323
Khaleesi, please.

557
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,687
I just need a moment of your time.

558
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,565
I brought you a gift.

559
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,561
It's true.

560
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,966
He has.

561
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,806
Who are you?

562
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,845
I am the gift.

563
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,084
It's a pleasure to meet you.

564
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,610
My name is Tyrion Lannister.

565
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,045
This is horrible.

566
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,685
Unacceptable.

567
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,763
Are they feeding you enough at least?

568
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,931
I brought you this.

569
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,521
Venison.

570
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,611
It's quite good.

571
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,810
I had it myself for supper only last night.

572
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:46,162
We did everything we could
from the moment they took your brother.

573
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,562
Tommen even went to the sept himself
to confront the High Sparrow.

574
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,411
But I fear the Faith has left reason behind.

575
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,448
I know you did this.

576
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,531
We are making every effort on your behalf.

577
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,721
I swear to you by all the seven gods.

578
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,280
Lies come easily to you.

579
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,486
Everyone knows that.

580
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,604
But innocence,

581
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,648
decency, concern,

582
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,648
you're not very good at those, I'm afraid.

583
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:20,564
Perhaps that's why your son was
so eager to cast you aside for me.

584
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,326
You're upset.

585
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,684
You're not thinking clearly.

586
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,527
I'll visit again when you've had a chance
to calm down.

587
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,603
I don't want to see you again.

588
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,967
I do hope you change your mind about that.

589
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:38,161
I've been told men often go mad
in the Black Cells beneath the Red Keep.

590
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:42,449
Though I suppose your isolation will end
when your trial begins.

591
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,881
Leave.

592
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,806
Yes.

593
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,848
I'm afraid I must.
My son needs me now more than ever.

594
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,483
Get out, you hateful bitch!

595
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,166
Sleep well, sister.

596
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,641
Thank you, Boake.

597
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,610
- You saw her?
- Yes.

598
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,287
- And?
- Her accommodations seem sufficient.

599
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,566
What happens to her now?

600
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,447
Well, she and her brother are both being held
under fair suspicion.

601
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:03,451
A trial will be held for each of them
to determine if they're guilty of any acts

602
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,241
that might constitute
a violation of the tenets of the faith.

603
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,090
Who will stand judge?

604
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:13,370
Seven septons, as it was in all trials
before the Targaryens.

605
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,921
Will you be one of them?

606
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,965
I will.

607
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:24,363
If one or both of them were to
confess before the trial...

608
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,204
Then they will be shown the Mother's mercy.

609
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,448
And what does the Mother's mercy entail?

610
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,408
It depends upon the situation.

611
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,730
The acts themselves,
the degree of contrition.

612
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,643
Thank you, High Septon,

613
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:41,160
for bringing them
whatever justice they deserve

614
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,845
in the eyes of the Seven.

615
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:51,245
Did you know this chapel is
one of the oldest structures

616
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,446
in King's Landing?

617
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,044
I think I may have heard at one point.

618
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,768
Baelor built his sept around it.

619
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,240
But men worshipped here long before him.

620
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,090
Who carved this altar?

621
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,008
- Do you know?
- I'm afraid I don't.

622
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,811
No one does.

623
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:16,002
There's no name on it,
or anywhere else in the chapel.

624
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,402
No, the people who built this place

625
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:24,367
didn't inflict their vanity
on those who came after them,

626
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,885
the way Baelor did
with that great gilded monstrosity up there.

627
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:29,961
Hmm.

628
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,170
Their faith was clean.

629
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,525
Strip away the gold and the ornaments,

630
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,567
knock down the statues and the pillars,

631
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,165
and this is what remains.

632
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,603
Something simple,

633
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,602
solid, and true.

634
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,483
The Tyrells' finery will be stripped away.

635
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:08,042
Their lies knocked down.
Their true hearts laid bare for all to see.

636
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,809
And so it will be for all of us.

637
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,842
High and low alike.

638
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,925
What will We find

639
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,247
when we strip away your finery?

640
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,491
A young man came to us not long ago,

641
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,683
broken in body and spirit.

642
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,402
He had so much to strip away.

643
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,244
So much weighing him down.

644
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,283
But piece by piece, he unburdened himself.

645
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,290
Let go of vanity,

646
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,002
pride, sin.

647
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,689
Now his soul is so light,

648
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,649
he will float through
the seven heavens like a bird.

649
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,041
Hmm.

650
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,927
And he has much to say about you.

651
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:35,921
Move.

652
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,527
Let me go immediately.

653
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,322
You will order her to let me go.

654
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,286
I am the queen!

655
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,044
Have you lost your mind?

656
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,481
Let me go!

657
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:56,001
...your filthy hands off me!
Are you out of your mind?

658
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,406
I am the queen! Let me go!

659
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,365
Look at me.

660
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,565
Look at my face.

661
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,205
It's the last thing you'll
see before you die.

662
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:29,500
<b><font color=#0E7521>Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
<b><font color=#0E7521>Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

2
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,646
Your Grace, I want to say...

3
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,085
You will not speak.

4
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,689
How do I know you are who you say you are?

5
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,330
If only I were otherwise.

6
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,324
If you are Tyrion Lannister,
why shouldn't I kill you

7
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,971
to pay your family back
for what it did to mine?

8
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,560
You want revenge against the Lannisters?

9
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,167
I killed my mother, Joanna Lannister,
on the day I was born.

10
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,843
I killed my father, Tywin Lannister,
with a bolt to the heart.

11
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,761
I am the greatest Lannister
killer of our time.

12
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,002
So I should welcome you into my service

13
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,208
because you murdered members
of your own family?

14
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,444
Into your service?

15
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,607
We have only just met.

16
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,368
It's too soon to know
if you deserve my service.

17
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,485
If you'd rather return to the fighting pits,
just say the word.

18
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,048
When I was a young man, I heard a story

19
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,964
about a baby born
during the worst storm in living memory.

20
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,488
She had no wealth, no lands, no army,
only a name

21
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,086
and a handful of supporters,
most of whom probably thought

22
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,891
they could use that name
to benefit themselves.

23
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,440
They kept her alive,
moving her from place to place,

24
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,410
often hours ahead
of the men who'd been sent to kill her.

25
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,802
She was eventually sold off to some warlord
on the edge of the world

26
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,689
and that appeared to be that.

27
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,325
Then, a few years later,
the most well-informed person I knew

28
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,246
told me that this girl
without wealth, lands, or armies

29
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,722
had somehow acquired all three
in a very short span of time,

30
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,564
along with three dragons.

31
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,841
He thought she was our best,
last chance to build a better world.

32
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,641
I thought you were worth meeting,
at the very least.

33
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,404
And why are you worth meeting?

34
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,403
Why should I spend my time listening to you?

35
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,165
Because you cannot build
a better world on your own.

36
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,086
You have no one at your side
who understands the land you want to rule,

37
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,084
the strengths and weaknesses of the houses
that will either join or oppose you.

38
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,322
I will have a very large army.

39
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,560
And very large dragons.

40
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,160
Killing and politics
aren't always the same thing.

41
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,411
When I served as Hand of the King,
I did quite well with the latter,

42
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,806
considering the king in question

43
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,168
preferred torturing animals
to leading his people.

44
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,167
I could do an even better job
advising a ruler worth the name.

45
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,649
If that is indeed what you are.

46
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,329
So you want to advise me?

47
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,205
Very well.

48
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,530
What would you have me do with him?

49
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,405
I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.

50
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,771
I know.

51
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,967
Why should the people trust a queen
who can't keep her promises?

52
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,250
Whomever Ser Jorah was
when he started informing on you,

53
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,169
he is no longer that man.

54
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,727
I can't remember ever seeing a sane man
as devoted to anything

55
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,529
as he is to serving you.

56
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,600
He claims he would kill for you
and die for you

57
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,684
and nothing I have witnessed
gives me reason to doubt him.

58
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,570
And yet he did betray you.

59
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,846
Did he have an opportunity
to confess his betrayal?

60
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,247
Yes.

61
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,082
Many opportunities.

62
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,763
- And did he?
- No.

63
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,081
Not until forced to do so.

64
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,168
He worships you.

65
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,361
He is in love with you, I think.

66
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,002
But he did not trust you with the truth.

67
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,442
An unpleasant truth to be sure,
but one of great significance to you.

68
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,523
He did not trust that you
would be wise enough to forgive him.

69
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,483
So I should kill him?

70
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,843
A ruler who kills those devoted to her
is not a ruler who inspires devotion.

71
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,689
And you're going to need to inspire devotion,
a lot of it,

72
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,730
if you're ever going to rule
across the Narrow Sea.

73
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,528
But you cannot have him by your side
when you do.

74
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,802
Remove Ser Jorah from the city.

75
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,721
Confess.

76
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,086
My son...

77
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,325
Let me speak to...

78
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,565
Confess.

79
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,846
I meant it.

80
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,922
My face will be the last thing you see...

81
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,763
My name is Lanna. I'm an orphan.

82
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,891
When I was eight, I begged enough money
to buy my first bucket of oysters.

83
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,850
I sold that bucket and made enough money
to buy two more.

84
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,089
It took a While,

85
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,607
but I finally saved enough
to buy myself an oyster cart.

86
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,849
Now every morning,
I make my way down to the canals.

87
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,844
I pass the fish mongers and the bakers.

88
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,610
I usually see Lhara,

89
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,331
my first customer of the day,
on her way home.

90
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,567
Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane...

91
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,609
Turn left onto Ragman Lane,
where I do most of my trade.

92
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,969
Lanna is very impressive.

93
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,804
Very industrious.

94
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,285
She will make a fine servant
for the Many-Faced God.

95
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,485
How will she serve him?

96
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,325
She will no longer
turn left onto Ragman Lane.

97
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,730
She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.

98
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,006
What will she do there?

99
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,725
She will see.

100
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,487
See what?

101
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,566
How can a man tell a girl this?

102
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,928
If he knew what she would see,
there would be no reason to send her.

103
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,006
Oysters, clams and cockles!

104
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,364
Oysters, clams and cockles!

105
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,601
Oysters, clams and cockles!

106
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,284
Your oysters fresh?

107
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,521
Best in the city.

108
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,489
You wouldn't lie to an old man, would you?

109
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,727
Mmm.

110
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,242
Very nice. Give me four with vinegar.

111
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,120
It's my 18th voyage.

112
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,769
Returned from all of them
without a scratch on me.

113
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,570
Can't do it.

114
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,403
Please, I've three children.
Without me...

115
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,249
Here, take it. You have to.
I've three children.

116
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,651
- What will they do?
- Come on.

117
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,484
They've nothing without me.

118
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,210
Please, you have to!

119
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,487
Please, you don't understand!

120
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,643
The man is a gambler.

121
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,521
He wagers that a sailor's ship
will make it to its destination.

122
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,371
It is a strange wager for the captain.

123
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,522
He only wins if he loses his life.

124
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,851
So why would a captain
make the wager in the first place?

125
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,609
A girl tells a man that she has seen.

126
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,248
If the captain dies,

127
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,322
the thin man pays his family a lot of money.

128
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,844
But perhaps the gambler loses his bet

129
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,082
and decides he does not
have to pay after all.

130
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,122
A destitute woman and her small child,
what can they do to such a man

131
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,726
if he keeps their money for himself?

132
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,040
To whom can they turn for recourse?

133
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,491
The Many-Faced God.

134
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,762
You said you didn't know
what I would see at the docks.

135
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,481
A man had no idea what a girl would see
and what she would not.

136
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,409
A girl named Lanna will return to the docks.

137
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,891
She will watch the gambler.

138
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,123
She will come to know as much about him
as she knows about herself.

139
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,440
And then what?

140
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,922
A gift for the thin man.

141
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,645
She's not ready.

142
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,041
Perhaps she is, perhaps she's not.

143
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,845
And if she's not?

144
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,684
It is all the same to the Many-Faced God.

145
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,562
The trial will take place soon.

146
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,841
The High Sparrow will be presenting
a substantial case against you.

147
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,001
The charges?

148
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,926
Fornication, treason, incest,
the murder of King Robert.

149
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,647
- All lies.
- Of course.

150
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,406
My concern is that the Faith does not adhere

151
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,166
to the same standards of proof as the crown.

152
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,689
I hope you'll excuse me for saying it,
but belief is so often the death of reason.

153
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,808
I wish you had said it sooner.

154
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,691
Is there any word from Jaime?

155
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,004
No, I'm afraid not.

156
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,484
Grand Maester Pycelle

157
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,208
has summoned your Uncle Kevan
back from Casterly Rock

158
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,930
to serve as Hand of the King.

159
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,566
He now presides over the Small Council.

160
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,368
Tell him I need to speak to him.

161
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,727
I implored him to visit you,
but he would not.

162
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,129
What about my son, the king?

163
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,368
If you can visit me, then surely the king...

164
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,727
Your arrest and Queen Margaery's arrest...

165
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,211
The king has not taken them well.

166
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,045
He remains in his chambers.

167
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,249
His servants often find his food
in the hall, left untouched.

168
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,570
You need to talk to him.

169
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,722
You need to talk to my son
and tell him to come and see me,

170
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,961
come and see his mother.

171
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,726
He... I tried. He wouldn't see me.

172
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,529
He won't see anyone.

173
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,290
I can't stay here.

174
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,606
There is a way.

175
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,960
A way out.

176
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,601
Confess?

177
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,201
To the High Sparrow? I won't.

178
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,090
I made him.

179
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,249
I rose him up from nothing.

180
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,005
I will not kneel before
some barefooted commoner

181
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,730
and beg his forgiveness.

182
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,363
Good bye.

183
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,521
The work continues.

184
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,240
Why?

185
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,891
Why, Theon?

186
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,249
Not Theon. There is no Theon.

187
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,651
- Reek.
- Reek.

188
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,007
Why did you tell him, Reek?

189
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,090
I was helping you.

190
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,045
You wanted to escape.

191
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,770
There is no escape.

192
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,366
Not ever.

193
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,602
Theon Greyjoy tried to escape.

194
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,924
The master knew.

195
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,445
He knows everything.

196
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,445
He hunted him and caught him
and strapped him to a cross

197
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,611
and cut away piece after piece
until there was no Theon left.

198
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,525
Good.

199
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,969
If it weren't for you,
I'd still have a family.

200
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,690
If I could do what Ramsay did to you

201
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,963
right here, right now, I would.

202
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,484
I deserved everything.

203
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,483
I deserve to be Reek.

204
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,809
I did terrible things.

205
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,645
Turned on Robb.

206
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,289
Captured Winterfell.

207
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,762
- Killed those boys.
- They weren't "those boys."

208
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,127
They were Bran and Rickon.
They were your brothers.

209
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,725
You'd known them since they were born.

210
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,211
They weren't. They were only...

211
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,327
Only what?

212
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,046
- I can't.
- Tell me.

213
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,565
I can't, not unless the master says.

214
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,801
- Tell me. They weren't what?
- They weren't...

215
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,289
Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be gone
while you still breathe the air.

216
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,409
Tell me to my face, Theon.
Tell me that they weren't your brothers!

217
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,005
They weren't Bran and Rickon!

218
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,970
I couldn't find them.

219
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,690
It was two farm boys.

220
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,800
I killed them and burned them
so no one would know.

221
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,880
You didn't...

222
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,604
Do you know where they went,
Bran and Rickon?

223
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,647
I can't talk to you anymore.

224
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,121
Theon, you have to tell me.
Do you have any idea where...

225
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,362
Not Theon! Reek!

226
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,162
Our scouts tell us
he's got no more than 6,000 men.

227
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,163
More than half of those
are mounted, however.

228
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,481
And how high do Stannis' horses jump?

229
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,405
Our walls have been fully repaired.
The gates have been reinforced.

230
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,691
We have enough food for six months.

231
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,809
We are more prepared for a siege
than they could ever be.

232
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:05,245
All we have to do is wait for them
to freeze, starve, and mutiny.

233
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,651
You disagree?

234
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,202
Stannis isn't from the North.
You are, Father.

235
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,169
I think you're missing an opportunity
to show the people of the North

236
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,971
how House Bolton treats southern invaders.

237
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,166
And what do you recommend?

238
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,924
That we not sit and wait
for Stannis to decide

239
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,128
what sort of fight this is going to be.

240
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,330
That we hit first and hit hard
and leave a feast for the crows.

241
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,483
A smart commander does not
abandon a defensive advantage.

242
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,164
As long as we stay behind these walls,
they can't touch us.

243
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,924
Not to mention that the snow is so deep,

244
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,083
we couldn't get an army through
to engage them even if we wanted to.

245
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,009
I don't need an army.

246
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,968
I need 20 good men.

247
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,884
So, have you decided yet?

248
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,122
Whether I'm worthy of your service?

249
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,883
Have you decided yet
whether you're going to have me killed?

250
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,883
It's probably my safest option.

251
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,803
I could see why you would think so.

252
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,284
It's what your father would have done.

253
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,845
And what would your father have done?

254
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,091
My father, who publically
sentenced me to death?

255
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,609
I'd say his thoughts on having me killed
were abundantly clear.

256
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,806
Is that why you killed him?

257
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,290
Someday, if you decide not to execute me,

258
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,047
I'll tell you all about
why I killed my father.

259
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,521
And on that day, should it ever come,

260
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,448
we'll need more wine than this.

261
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,251
I know what my father was.

262
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,805
What he did.

263
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,882
I know the Mad King earned his name.

264
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,407
So, here we sit.

265
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,851
Two terrible children of
two terrible fathers.

266
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,610
I'm terrible?

267
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,011
I've heard stories.

268
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,205
Why did you travel to the
far side of the world

269
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,089
to meet someone terrible?

270
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,123
To see if you were the
right kind of terrible.

271
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,281
Which kind is that?

272
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,330
The kind that prevents your people
from being even more so.

273
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,048
Well, I did reopen the fighting pits.

274
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,930
Under my rule, murder will once again
become entertainment.

275
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,843
Yes, that was wise.

276
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,083
And you agreed to marry someone you loathe
for the greater good.

277
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,241
Very impressive.

278
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,845
My own sister married someone
she loathed as well,

279
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,081
though not by choice,

280
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,289
and certainly not for the greater good,
gods forbid.

281
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,771
She ended up having him killed.

282
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,201
Perhaps it won't come to that.

283
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,729
It's not impossible that Varys was right
about you after all.

284
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,810
Varys? King Robert's spymaster?

285
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,406
Yes, he's the one who convinced me
to come find you.

286
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,486
He was my traveling companion,
before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.

287
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,688
Jorah sent my secrets to Varys.

288
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,083
For 20 years, the spider
oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.

289
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,845
He did what he had to do to survive.

290
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,003
He did a lot of other things as well,
things he didn't have to do.

291
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,721
I suspect he's the main reason
you weren't slaughtered in your crib.

292
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,121
- But you trust him?
- Yes, oddly.

293
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,090
He may be the only person
in the world I trust.

294
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,490
Except my brother.

295
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,848
The brother who killed my father?

296
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,561
That's the one.

297
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,529
Perhaps I will have you killed after all.

298
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,125
Your queenly prerogative.

299
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,770
I had given up on life

300
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,284
until Varys convinced me
you might be worth living for.

301
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,050
You chop off my head, well,
my final days were interesting.

302
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,409
I'm not going to kill you.

303
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,006
No?

304
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,483
- Banish me?
- No.

305
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,010
So if I'm not going to be murdered
and I'm not going to be banished...

306
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,605
You're going to advise me.

307
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,727
While you can still speak
in complete sentences.

308
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,646
- Advise you on what?
- How to get what I want.

309
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,490
The Iron Throne.

310
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,248
Perhaps you should try
wanting something else.

311
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,926
If I want jokes, I'll get
myself a proper fool.

312
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,002
I'm not entirely joking.

313
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,845
There's more to the world than Westeros.

314
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,050
How many hundreds of thousands of lives
have you changed for the better here?

315
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,602
Perhaps this is where you belong,
where you can do the most good.

316
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,731
I fought so that no child
born into Slaver's Bay

317
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,849
would ever know what it meant
to be bought or sold.

318
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,810
I will continue that fight here and beyond.

319
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,324
But this is not my home.

320
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,131
When you get back to your home,
who supports you?

321
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,690
The common people.

322
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,411
Let's be generous
and assume that's going to happen.

323
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,608
Here in Slaver's Bay,
you had the support of the common people

324
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,921
and only the common people.

325
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,047
What was that like?

326
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,609
Ruling without the rich?

327
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,482
House Targaryen is gone.

328
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,484
Not a single person who shares your blood
is alive to support you.

329
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,283
The Starks are gone as well.
Our two terrible fathers saw to that.

330
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,081
The remaining members of House Lannister
will never back you, not ever.

331
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,761
Stannis Baratheon won't back you, either.

332
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,049
His entire claim to the throne rests on
the illegitimacy of yours.

333
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,963
That leaves the Tyrells.

334
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,411
Not impossible.

335
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,641
Not enough.

336
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,202
Lannister, Targaryen,
Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell.

337
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,282
They're all just spokes on a wheel.

338
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,203
This one's on top, then that one's on top.

339
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,524
And on and on it spins,
crushing those on the ground.

340
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,571
It's a beautiful dream, stopping the wheel.

341
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,251
You're not the first person
who's ever dreamt it.

342
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,242
I'm not going to stop the wheel.

343
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,042
I'm going to break the wheel.

344
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,611
You said whoever wins will fight
at the Great Pit in front of the queen.

345
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,966
I won.

346
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,521
You struck me.

347
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,887
Have me flogged if it makes you happy.

348
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,168
But I'm the best you've got.

349
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,249
If I win at the Great Pit,

350
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,804
how much can you sell me for?

351
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,883
You're a free man.
You could have gone anywhere.

352
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,205
Why did you come back?

353
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,727
Let me fight for her and I belong to you.

354
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,125
Thirsty?

355
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,846
Confess.

356
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,003
I'll get out of here before long.

357
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,081
Confess.

358
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,481
I can make you a wealthy woman.

359
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,245
A lady of the court.

360
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,685
Confess.

361
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,245
Or I can make sure you die
in the most hideous way imaginable.

362
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,962
And all I do is sit here
imagining hideous ways for you to die.

363
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,410
Does it hurt?

364
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,486
No.

365
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,561
Good.

366
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,090
How are you?

367
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,448
I'm not the one who got punched
and kicked in the face.

368
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,405
You know what I mean.

369
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,246
I'm good.

370
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,281
Are you scared?

371
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,764
- A little.
- Me, too.

372
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,364
- Who's there?
- Olly.

373
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,081
Ch.

374
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,046
Come in.

375
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,770
I heard what happened.

376
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,610
Oh, not to worry.

377
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,923
Men brawl from time to time.
It's only natural.

378
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,010
Figured you were hungry.

379
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,370
Oh, you're a good lad.

380
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,082
Wanted to ask you something
if you've got the time.

381
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,443
I need to check on baby Sam.

382
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,044
Now then, how can I help?

383
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,768
- It's about the Lord Commander.
- Yes?

384
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,049
He's going up to Hardhome
to save all them wildlings.

385
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,406
Wildlings killed my mum and dad.

386
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,449
- They killed everyone in my village.
- We've been fighting them for years.

387
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,204
This wasn't a fight.

388
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,044
We were farmers.

389
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,645
They slaughtered us.

390
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,525
So why is he saving them?

391
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,122
Wildlings are people.

392
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,605
Just like us, there are good ones
and bad ones.

393
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,042
The one he's traveling with,
with the red beard,

394
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,600
he led the raid on my village.

395
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,330
- Oh, Olly...
- How can he trust him?

396
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,531
I've seen the army of the dead.

397
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,887
I've seen the White Walkers.

398
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,930
And they're coming for us,
for all the living.

399
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,683
And when it's time,

400
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,525
we'll need every last man we can find.

401
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,771
But what if we let the wildlings
through the gates

402
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,649
and they cut our throats while we sleep?

403
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,530
Jon's taking a risk, but he has to.

404
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,841
We don't stand a chance otherwise.

405
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,769
Sometimes, a man has to make hard choices,

406
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,683
choices that might look wrong to others,

407
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,525
but you know are right in the long run.

408
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,450
You believe that?

409
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,369
With all my heart.

410
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,328
Try not to worry.

411
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,687
I've been worrying about Jon for years.

412
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,285
He always comes back.

413
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,445
Watch your bow!

414
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,049
You trust me, Jon Snow?

415
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,362
Does that make me a fool?

416
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,488
We're fools together now.

417
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,245
Lord of Bones.

418
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,168
Been a long time.

419
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,124
Last time I saw you,
the little crow was your prisoner.

420
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,567
The other way around now. What happened?

421
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,246
War.

422
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,926
You call that a war?

423
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,287
The greatest army the North has ever seen

424
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,290
cut to pieces by some southern king.

425
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,089
We should gather the elders,

426
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,523
find somewhere quiet to talk.

427
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,250
You don't give the orders here.

428
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,288
I'm not giving an order.

429
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,850
Why aren't you in chains?

430
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,610
He's not my prisoner.

431
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,805
No?

432
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,445
What is he?

433
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,090
We're allies.

434
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,241
You fucking traitor.

435
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,727
You fight for the crows now?

436
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,041
I don't fight for the crows.

437
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,962
We're not here to fight. We're here to talk.

438
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,407
Is that right?

439
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,962
You and the pretty crow
do a lot of talking, Tormund?

440
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,929
And when you're done talking,

441
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,685
do you get down on your knees
and suck his cock?

442
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,164
Gather the elders, and let's talk.

443
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,124
My name's Jon Snow.

444
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,328
I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

445
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,484
We're not friends.

446
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,163
We've never been friends.

447
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,447
We won't become friends today.

448
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,883
This isn't about friendship.

449
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,049
This is about survival.

450
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,009
This is about putting a 700-foot wall

451
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,208
between you and what's out there.

452
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,408
You built that wall to keep us out.

453
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,404
Since when do the crows give two shits
if we live?

454
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,563
In normal times we wouldn't,
but these aren't normal times.

455
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,883
The White Walkers don't care
if a man's free folk or crow.

456
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,089
We're all the same to them,
meat for their army.

457
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,288
But together, we can beat them.

458
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,000
Beat the White Walkers?

459
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,166
Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe.

460
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,845
It's not a trick.

461
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,844
It's a gift, for those who join us.

462
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,365
Dragonglass.

463
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,484
A man of the Night's Watch

464
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,245
used one of these daggers to kill a Walker.

465
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,810
- You saw this?
- No.

466
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,925
But I trust the man.

467
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,520
There are old stories about dragonglass.

468
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,201
There are old stories
about ice spiders big as hounds.

469
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,482
And with the things we've seen,
you don't believe them?

470
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,207
Come with me
and I'll share these weapons.

471
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,805
Come with you where?

472
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,644
There are good lands south of the wall.

473
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,449
The Night's Watch
will let you through the tunnel

474
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,921
and allow your people to farm those lands.

475
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,048
I knew Mance Rayder.

476
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,090
He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch.

477
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,766
He wanted a new life for his people, for you.

478
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,286
We're prepared to give you that new life.

479
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,687
If?

480
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,730
If you swear you'll join us
when the real war begins.

481
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,241
Where is Mance?

482
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,922
- He died.
- How?

483
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,966
I put an arrow through his heart.

484
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,966
Hey.

485
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,929
Hey.

486
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,571
Hey.

487
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:13,042
I say we send the Lord Commander
back to Castle Black.

488
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,531
With no eyes.

489
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,081
Hey, none of you saw Mance die.

490
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,045
I did.

491
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,329
The southern king,
who broke our army, Stannis,

492
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,210
wanted to burn him alive to
send us a message.

493
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,726
Jon Snow defied that cunt's orders.

494
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,169
His arrow was mercy.

495
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,770
What he did took courage.

496
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,370
And that's what we need today,

497
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,968
the courage to make peace
with men we've been killing for generations.

498
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,929
I lost my father, my uncle, and two brothers
fighting the damn crows.

499
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,809
I'm not asking you to forget your dead.

500
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,282
I'll never forget mine.

501
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,926
I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance
attacked the wall.

502
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,731
But I'm asking you

503
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,684
to think about your children now.

504
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,321
They'll never have children of their own
if we don't band together.

505
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,687
The Long Night is coming,

506
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,603
and the dead come with it.

507
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,368
No clan can stop them.

508
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,090
The free folk can't stop them.

509
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,525
The Night's Watch can't stop them.

510
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,968
And all the southern kings can't stop them.

511
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,161
Only together...

512
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,920
All of us.

513
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,411
And even then, it may not be enough.

514
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,165
But at least we'll give the fuckers a fight.

515
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,364
You vouch for this man, Tormund?

516
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,644
He's prettier than both my daughters,

517
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,963
but he knows how to fight.

518
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,646
He's young, but he knows how to lead.

519
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,803
He didn't have to come to Hardhome.

520
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,528
He came because he needs us.

521
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,201
And we need him.

522
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,162
My ancestors would spit on me
if I broke bread with a crow.

523
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,771
So would mine, but fuck 'em. They're dead.

524
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,091
I'll never trust a man in black.

525
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,160
But I trust you, Tormund.

526
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,328
If you say this is the way,

527
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,530
we're with you.

528
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,451
This is the way.

529
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,243
I'm with Tormund.

530
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,522
We stay here, we're dead men.

531
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,324
At least with King Crow, there's a chance.

532
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,002
Tormund.

533
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,844
Keep that new life you want to give us.

534
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,201
And keep your glass, King Crow.

535
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,209
As soon as you get on his ships,
they're gonna slit your throats,

536
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,602
and dump your bodies
to the bottom of the Shivering Sea.

537
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,010
That's our enemy.

538
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,087
That has always been our enemy.

539
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,650
I fucking hate Thenns.

540
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,841
- Move it.
- Be careful.

541
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,049
- Move 'em along, now.
- We'll catch the tides.

542
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,169
That's it, come on!

543
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,480
How many are with us? Five thousand?

544
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,365
I'm not good at counting.

545
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,370
We're leaving too many behind.

546
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,771
The free folk are stubborn.

547
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,650
You know how long it took Mance
to band them together?

548
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,961
Twenty fucking years.

549
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,361
And he knew them better than I ever will.

550
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,405
They're running out of food,
and there's nothing to hunt.

551
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,010
They'll come around.

552
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,889
- Get yourselves ready.
- Aye!

553
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,124
Johnna is gonna look after you.

554
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,806
She's in charge. You listen to her.

555
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,520
Take her.

556
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,120
I want to go with you.

557
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,885
I need to get the old folks on the boats.

558
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,923
I'm right behind you. I promise.

559
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,201
Go on.

560
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,721
Another one.

561
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,641
Keep moving.
We'll meet you out there.

562
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,611
Won't be able to take that on the boat.
It's too big.

563
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,843
- That's the last one!
- Three more! Move on!

564
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,448
There's more
dragonglass everywhere.

565
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,247
I've got some more daggers
over here.

566
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,769
Put that dagger in his bag.

567
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,761
Uh...

568
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,922
The fuck you looking at?

569
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,284
Steady!

570
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,930
Shut the gate.

571
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,684
Shut the gate!

572
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,684
Shut the gate!

573
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,682
- Open the gate!
- Let us in!

574
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,688
Open the gate!

575
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,091
Ready your arrows!

576
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,043
- Wait!
- Keep in line! Get in line!

577
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,250
Get in line!

578
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,489
Get to the front!

579
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,970
Go on, shoot it!

580
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,368
- Wait!
- Duncan, hold the line!

581
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,206
Lord Commander!

582
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,641
Get them to the ship and come back for me!

583
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,643
- But you'll never make...
- Now!

584
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,327
- Let me on!
- Let me on!

585
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,209
- Bloody fucking move!
- Let go!

586
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,170
You should be on one of those boats.

587
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,164
So should you. My little girls got on.

588
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,402
They're gonna let them pass the Wall
even if you're not there?

589
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,847
You have my word. I've given orders.

590
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:34,403
Don't think you're gonna be there
to enforce those orders.

591
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,207
If they get through, everyone dies!

592
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,530
Night's Watch!

593
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,683
With me! Move!

594
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,811
Move!

595
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,121
No!

596
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,761
- Tormund, the sleigh!
- Okay!

597
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,330
The dragonglass.

598
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,640
You and me, then!

599
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,046
Go!

600
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,481
Get the glass.

601
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,165
Come on!

602
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,368
- The dragonglass.
- Fuck the glass!

603
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,010
We are gonna die here!

604
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,004
Oh, fuck!

605
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,086
Here they come!

606
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,490
Wun Wun, to the sea!

607
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,765
In the boats! Quickly!

608
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,087
- Faster, faster!
- Run!

609
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,651
Quickly!

610
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,889
- Go! Row!
- Go, come on!

611
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,761
Let's go! Now!

612
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:50,500
<b><font color=#0E7521>Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
<b><font color=#0E7521>Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

2
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,848
- Look out!
- Fire!

3
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,725
A band of 20 men, maybe less.

4
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,041
They were in and out
before anyone spotted them.

5
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,284
Burned our food stores to the ground,
all our siege weapons destroyed.

6
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,522
- Dozens of tents were...
- Horses?

7
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,841
We're still getting a count,
but hundreds are dead.

8
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,720
Twenty men rode into our camp
without a single guard sounding the alarm?

9
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,041
The Northerners know more about their land
than we ever will.

10
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,451
Put last night's guards in chains.

11
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,682
Either they fell asleep
or they conspired with the enemy.

12
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,207
- Find out the truth and then hang them.
- Your Grace.

13
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,602
Unless there's a thaw,
we can't press forward to Winterfell

14
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,126
and we don't have enough food
to get us back to Castle Black.

15
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,964
We're not returning to Castle Black.

16
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,408
Forgive me, I never claimed
to be an expert in military matters,

17
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,121
but if we can't march forward
and we won't march back...

18
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,880
Have the dead horses butchered for meat.

19
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,250
Halt!

20
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,686
Halt!

21
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,363
There it is!

22
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,882
Open the gates.

23
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,762
It was a failure.

24
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,365
It wasn't.

25
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,767
I went to save them. I failed.

26
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,045
You didn't fail him.

27
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,121
Or him.

28
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,807
Or her.

29
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,527
Every one of them is alive
because of you and no one else.

30
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,281
I don't think that fact's lost on them.

31
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,886
You have a good heart.

32
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,047
It'll get us all killed.

33
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,164
Get out of my way.

34
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,930
You sent for me?

35
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,128
Find some healthy horses
and a few knights to guard you.

36
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,401
I'm sending you back to Castle Black.

37
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,322
Tell the Lord Commander
his king commands him

38
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,971
to send food, supplies, fresh horses.

39
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,684
In return, when I take the throne,

40
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,525
I'll make sure the Night's Watch
has all the men it requires.

41
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,922
He can guard all 19 castles on the Wall
if he so wishes.

42
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,250
You named me your Hand.

43
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,846
Yes.

44
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,763
The King's Hand should
never abandon the king,

45
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,171
especially in time of war.

46
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,242
You're not abandoning me.
You're obeying a command.

47
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,561
A boy with a scroll
could deliver this message.

48
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,211
And if Jon Snow refuses
the boy with the scroll,

49
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,884
what does the boy say?

50
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,440
I didn't name you Hand
for your expertize in military matters.

51
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,649
Ride for Castle Black.
Don't come back empty-handed.

52
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,726
Perhaps Queen Selyse
and Princess Shireen could accompany me.

53
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,165
My family stays with me.

54
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,122
At least let me take Shireen.

55
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,568
A siege is no place for a little girl.

56
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,961
My family stays with me.

57
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,367
What's this one now?

58
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,240
A True Telling
by Grand Maester Munkun.

59
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,684
Now that sounds like a proper story.

60
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,451
Ser Byron Swann wanted
to kill the dragon Vhagar.

61
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,841
He polished his shield for a week
so that it was like a mirror.

62
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,248
And he crouched behind it and crept forward,

63
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,368
hoping the dragon
would only see its own reflection.

64
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,523
But the dragon saw a dumb man
holding a mirrored shield.

65
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,205
And burned him to a crisp.

66
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,166
Thus ending the dragon-slaying career
of Ser Byron Swann.

67
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,282
I made you something.

68
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,043
- Do you like it?
- He's beautiful.

69
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,922
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

70
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,446
Will you make me a doe, too?
So that he can have company?

71
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,204
Of course I will.

72
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,251
But why am I getting a present?

73
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,729
Because you deserve it.

74
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,966
My son was always on me,
trying to teach me to read.

75
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,168
Gods, I was stubborn about it.

76
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,970
Made it this far without reading.

77
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,407
Seemed to me I could make it to the grave.

78
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,722
Wish I'd listened to him.

79
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,488
This is my own poor way
of saying "thank you."

80
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,288
For teaching me to be a grown-up.

81
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,402
I'll be gone for a few days.

82
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,527
I want to hear all about
The Dance of Dragons when I'm back.

83
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,728
You'll read it yourself.

84
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,771
Prince Doran.

85
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,286
Forgive us. We started without you.

86
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,169
Please, sit.

87
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,724
Princess Myrcella.

88
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,401
Uncle.

89
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,250
What a lovely dress.

90
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,446
You don't like it?

91
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,170
- You must be cold.
- Not at all.

92
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,126
The Dornish climate agrees with me.

93
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,001
Prince Trystane.

94
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,281
How's your jaw?

95
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,165
A fleabite.

96
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,924
What are you doing in Dorne?

97
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,207
Looking after the safety of my niece.

98
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,489
And rather than send a raven
or speak to me directly,

99
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,483
you decided to enter my country in secret

100
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,729
and abduct our guest by force?

101
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,087
We received a threatening message.

102
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,001
The princess's necklace
in the jaws of a viper.

103
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,362
That necklace was stolen from my room.

104
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,290
Oh, excellent.

105
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,362
A last meal before the beheading?

106
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,090
Oh, I can't behead you.

107
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,401
Many in Dorne want war.

108
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,767
But I've seen war.

109
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,650
I've seen the bodies piled
on the battlefields.

110
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,849
I've seen the orphans starving in the cities.

111
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,922
I don't want to lead my
people into that hell.

112
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,765
No, you want to break bread
with the Lannisters.

113
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,003
And that is precisely what we are doing.

114
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,721
Let us drink to Tommen,
the First of His Name,

115
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,689
King of the Andals and the First Men,

116
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,485
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

117
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,050
King Tommen insists
on his sister's return to the capital?

118
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,446
I'm afraid he does.

119
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,443
I cannot disobey my king's command.

120
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,120
She will return with you to King's Landing.

121
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,528
And my son, Prince Trystane,
will accompany you both.

122
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,321
If the alliance between
the Iron Throne and Dorne is to continue,

123
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,845
their engagement must stand.

124
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,881
I accept.

125
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,361
One more thing.

126
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,445
My brother was named to the Small Council
before his death.

127
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,320
Your father understood the importance
of keeping Dorne in the fold.

128
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,447
With Oberyn gone,

129
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,808
Trystane will take his place
on the Small Council.

130
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,041
You have my word.

131
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,407
The word of a Kingslayer.

132
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,045
No wonder you can't stand.
You have no spine.

133
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,081
You are mother to four of my nieces,
girls I love very much.

134
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,970
For their sake,
I hope you live a long and happy life.

135
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,441
Speak to me that way again, and you won't.

136
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,961
May I inquire as to the fate of my man Bronn?

137
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,089
Tell me, in King's Landing,

138
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,323
how do they punish a commoner
who strikes a prince?

139
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,970
He said it was just a fleabite.

140
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,446
The fault is mine.
Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders.

141
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,962
If anyone should be punished, it's me.

142
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,964
Prince Trystane must learn judgment
if he is to rule one day.

143
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,724
I'll let him decide.

144
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,405
I have learned the value of mercy
from my father.

145
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,643
- I'll set your man free.
- You're a good man.

146
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,448
On one condition.

147
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,601
Why do we play? I'm better than you.

148
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,001
I'll always be better than you.

149
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,890
Have I ever missed once?

150
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,088
I don't think I have. I can't recall.

151
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,807
You must love humiliation. Or pain.

152
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,041
Which do you love most?

153
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,891
That one hurt, didn't it?

154
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,088
You going to cry?

155
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,924
Give up, little sister.

156
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,241
- You're going to miss.
- Oh, I never miss.

157
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,607
You will. You're thinking too much.

158
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,529
Now you're nervous. "What if she's right?"

159
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,001
Luck.

160
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,771
Now it's my turn.

161
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,202
You're too slow.
You've always been too slow.

162
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,882
Am I gonna be happy at the end of this walk?

163
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,883
You'll find out very soon.

164
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,684
Say it one more time, handsome.

165
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,091
Who am I?

166
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,166
The most beautiful woman in the world.

167
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,605
And that's the truth.

168
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,843
Slut.

169
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:28,082
Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

170
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,766
I didn't realize
there were knights of the Blackwater.

171
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,280
Only the one.

172
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,840
I believe you've already met Prince Trystane.

173
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,250
Prince.

174
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,011
Sorry about the other day.

175
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,526
Prince Trystane here
is a man of mercy.

176
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,080
He's agreed to grant you your freedom.

177
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,442
I'm glad to hear it.

178
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,361
Pie looks good.

179
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,920
There was one condition.

180
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,647
Perhaps some soup instead.

181
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,770
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

182
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,723
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

183
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,722
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

184
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,849
Oysters, clams, and...

185
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,651
How much for your little clam?

186
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,971
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

187
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,850
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

188
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,768
Come on.

189
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,888
Some oysters, girl!

190
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,081
I'm talking to you.

191
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,006
Is, uh...

192
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,521
- Girl!
- Tie her up!

193
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,645
Are you deaf? Girl!

194
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,685
Girl!

195
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,490
My lord.

196
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,203
SAILOR; My lord.

197
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,805
Lord Tyrell.

198
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,609
On behalf of the Iron Bank,

199
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,366
may I be the first to welcome you
to the Free City of Braavos.

200
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,209
I hope your journey was trouble-free.

201
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,966
A bit of chop the last few days.
Nothing too awful.

202
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,805
Good to see the old chap
still guarding the harbor.

203
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,042
And how goes the harvest in the Reach?

204
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,843
Ah, the vintners say this might be the best
year for red grapes in half a century.

205
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,605
If we come to a satisfactory arrangement,

206
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,641
I'll be sure to send
a cask of the Arbor's finest your way.

207
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,291
I'm afraid I don't partake.

208
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,601
Oh.

209
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:28,122
Some consider usury
distasteful, dishonorable.

210
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,850
Pure nonsense, of course.

211
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,002
I'm glad we see eye to eye on this matter.

212
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,211
Did you know that at one point Maegor III
tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms?

213
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,687
Wanted to arrest anyone
caught charging interest

214
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,127
and cut off both their hands.

215
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,368
Most unfortunate for the glovers.

216
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,442
If a man charges no interest on a loan,

217
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,162
then he has nothing to gain
and everything to lose, so why chance it?

218
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,404
Whereas the promise of reward
makes a man willing to gamble.

219
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,927
We are not gamblers
here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell.

220
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,367
You are the world's best gamblers.

221
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,206
And all those bets you won built this.

222
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,046
We should celebrate.

223
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,691
I'm afraid I still
have a good deal of work to do.

224
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,286
- Nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?
- I don't have that gift.

225
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,727
It's not a gift. It's a skill.
Anyone can learn it.

226
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,210
So give me a kiss by the Long Canal

227
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,251
And give me two kisses in Salty Town

228
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,291
For we're going to die tomorrow

229
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,642
The bareheaded beggar
The king with his crown...

230
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,842
Thought that old shit
would never stop singing.

231
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,084
Wasn't bad, though.

232
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,640
The Tyrells can all rot in hell.

233
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,210
Treasonous cunts.

234
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,090
They were going to make
that boy-fucker Renly king.

235
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,288
This is the place, lads.

236
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,971
The sleekest little minks in Braavos.

237
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,611
- You buying?
- Oh, I'm buying.

238
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,648
But I never was good at sharing.

239
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,848
Sell your fish somewhere else.

240
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,730
Oh, let her in, Brusco. I'm hungry.

241
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,681
Come here, sweetness.

242
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,651
They say oysters get the juices flowing.

243
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,367
We'll take half a dozen.

244
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,649
Three coppers.

245
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,968
Here's a silver because the lady likes you.

246
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,086
Too old.

247
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,841
Brea.

248
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,566
Too old.

249
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,128
I have just the one. Anara.

250
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,564
Our most expensive girl.

251
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,810
But well worth it, I assure you.

252
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,609
Too old.

253
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,410
Do you have what I want or not?

254
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,168
Of course. Of course.

255
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,605
These fresh?

256
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,331
Come on, the lads are hungry.

257
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,129
Nothing better for your cockstand
than fresh oysters.

258
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,130
- Here. Thank you.
- I'll have one.

259
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,164
Any vinegar?

260
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,049
Who let this girl in? Shoo! Shoo!

261
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,964
Good.

262
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,130
I'll tell you when we're done.

263
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,883
You'll have a fresh one for me tomorrow?

264
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,165
Of course.

265
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,530
I'll have you whipped, girl.

266
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,841
Go, go on. Out, out, go.

267
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,725
Valar Morghulis.

268
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,571
And?

269
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,325
The thin man wasn't hungry today.

270
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,528
Perhaps that is why a man is thin.

271
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,726
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

272
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,522
A girl has work to do.

273
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,128
Your rebellion is over.

274
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,162
You can swear your allegiance to me now,

275
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,609
or you can die.

276
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,081
I believe in second chances.

277
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,811
I don't believe in third chances.

278
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,208
You write like a seven-year-old.

279
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,011
Your maester kindly agreed
to copy it over for me.

280
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,321
- He didn't try to make you pay?
- Mmm-mmm.

281
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,568
Maybe he's changed.

282
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,130
The queen will be thrilled to know
you're bringing her daughter home.

283
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,201
She Will.

284
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,611
- You love her very much, don't you?
- Of course, she's my niece.

285
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,004
I wasn't talking about her.

286
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,202
You think I disapprove?

287
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,327
Why?

288
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,804
Because people disapprove
of that sort of thing where you are from?

289
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,009
They disapproved of Oberyn and me
where you are from.

290
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,641
Here, no one blinked an eye.

291
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,931
100 years ago,
no one would have blinked an eye at you

292
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,604
if you'd been named Targaryen.

293
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,801
It's always changing,

294
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,770
who we're supposed to love
and who we're not.

295
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,010
The only thing that stays the same
is that we want who we want.

296
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,002
I know your daughter had no part
in the terrible thing

297
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,162
that happened to the man I love.

298
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,361
Perhaps even you are innocent of that.

299
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,803
Father.

300
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,606
Aren't you cold?

301
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,003
No. What are you reading?

302
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,565
The Dance of Dragons.

303
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,880
What's it about?

304
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,246
It's the story of the fight

305
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,322
between Rhaenyra Targaryen
and her half-brother Aegon

306
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,607
for control of the Seven Kingdoms.

307
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,490
Both of them thought
they belonged on the Iron Throne.

308
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,731
When people started declaring
for one of them or the other,

309
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,848
their fight divided the kingdoms in two.

310
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,322
Brothers fought brothers,
dragons fought dragons.

311
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,085
By the time it was over, thousands were dead.

312
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,925
And it was a disaster
for the Targaryens as well.

313
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,721
They never truly recovered.

314
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,848
The Dance of Dragons.

315
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,762
Why is that a dance?

316
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,683
It's just what they call it.

317
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,364
Hmm. Doesn't make much sense.

318
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,329
I think it's poetic.

319
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,851
If you'd had to choose

320
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,083
between Rhaenyra and Aegon,

321
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,246
who would you have chosen?

322
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,286
I wouldn't have chosen either.

323
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,966
It's all the choosing sides
that made everything so horrible.

324
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,281
Sometimes a person has to choose.

325
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,643
Sometimes the world forces his hand.

326
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,490
If a man knows what he is

327
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,730
and remains true to himself,

328
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,447
the choice is no choice at all.

329
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,480
He must fulfill his destiny

330
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,162
and become who he is meant to be.

331
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,722
However much he may hate it.

332
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,969
It's all right.

333
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,845
You don't even know what I'm talking about.

334
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,844
It doesn't matter. I want to help you.

335
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,450
Is there any way I can help?

336
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,800
Yes, there is.

337
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,605
Good. I want to.

338
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,767
I'm the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon.

339
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,922
And I'm your daughter.

340
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,203
Forgive me.

341
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,847
Where's my father? I want to see my father.

342
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,890
It will all be over soon.

343
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,161
No.

344
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,088
Where's my father?

345
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,640
No, you can't do this. Father, where are you?

346
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,087
Please, let me see my father.

347
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,050
Father, where are you? Don't let her do this.

348
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,407
Please let go!

349
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,169
Let me see my father! Where are you? Please!

350
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,525
- It's what the Lord wants.
- No.

351
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,725
- Please! Let go! No!
- It's a good thing.

352
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,842
- A great thing.
- Stop!

353
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,968
- Please!
- Hear us now, my Lord.

354
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,725
- You can't do this!
- For you, we offer up this girl...

355
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,201
- Please!
- ...that you may cleanse her with your fire

356
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,248
and that its light may lead our way.

357
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,402
No, please let me see my father.

358
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,285
If we don't act, we'll all starve here.
All of us.

359
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,204
But if we make this sacrifice...

360
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:51,411
Accept this token of our faith, my Lord,
and lead us from the darkness.

361
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,642
Lord of Light, show us the way.

362
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,563
Mother, please!

363
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,130
Mother, please!

364
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,850
- Mother!
- We can't.

365
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,287
- There's no other way. She has king's blood.
- Please don't do this!

366
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,283
- Please don't!
- Lord of Light, protect us.

367
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,285
- Father, please!
- For the night is dark and full of terrors.

368
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,884
Father, don't do this! Please!

369
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,328
Mother, no! Please, help!

370
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,767
Don't do this!

371
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,571
Please, Father! Mother, help!

372
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,723
- No.
- No, please! Don't do this!

373
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,168
Don't do this, please, Mother!

374
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,086
Please, Mother! Help!

375
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,049
Mother, help!

376
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,801
Please don't do this, Mother!

377
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,042
Please, Mother!

378
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:47,206
Please! No!

379
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,124
No!

380
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,284
Where have you been?

381
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,567
Just making sure everything is in order.

382
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,051
Free Citizens of Meereen!

383
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,327
By the blessings of the Graces,

384
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,121
and her majesty the Queen,

385
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,960
welcome

386
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,487
to the Great Games!

387
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,611
My Queen, our first contest.

388
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,527
Who will triumph:

389
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,410
the strong,

390
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,284
or the quick?

391
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,082
I fight and die for your glory,

392
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,842
oh glorious Queen.

393
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,729
I fight and die for your glory,

394
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,883
oh glorious Queen.

395
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,281
They're waiting for you.

396
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,770
Clap your hands.

397
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,891
That one, the smaller man.

398
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,530
No question,
that's where you should put your money.

399
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,886
The smaller man it is.

400
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,849
I'm not putting my money anywhere.

401
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,082
Kings and queens never bet on the games.

402
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,640
Perhaps you should
go find someone who does.

403
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,566
People used to bet against me
when I fought in the pits.

404
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,405
He would have bet against me.
Common novice mistake.

405
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,403
I've spent much of my life in this arena.

406
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,963
And in my experience, large men do triumph
over smaller men far more often than not.

407
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,884
Has your experience
ever involved any actual fighting?

408
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,610
You yourself?

409
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,445
Have you ever tried to kill another man
who was trying to kill you?

410
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,604
Whenever I got into the pit
against a beast like that one,

411
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,331
the crowd saw me,
all skin and bone back then,

412
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,370
then they saw a pile of angry muscles
ready to murder me.

413
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,727
They couldn't get
their money out fast enough.

414
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,247
But the pile of angry muscles
never had any muscles here

415
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,766
or here.

416
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,449
And the big men were always too slow

417
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,330
to stop my dagger
from going where their muscles weren't.

418
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,166
Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one
standing across from me

419
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,404
making his beast faces,
I knew I could rest easy.

420
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,889
You don't approve?

421
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,930
There's always been more than enough death
in the world for my taste.

422
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,970
- I can do without it in my leisure time.
- Fair enough.

423
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,610
Yet it's an unpleasant question,

424
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,810
but what great thing has ever been
accomplished without killing or cruelty?

425
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,282
It's easy to confuse
what is with what ought to be,

426
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,204
especially when what is
has worked out in your favor.

427
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,850
I'm not talking about myself.

428
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,241
I'm talking about
the necessary conditions for greatness.

429
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,448
That is greatness?

430
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,764
That is a vital part
of the great city of Meereen,

431
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,763
which existed long before you or I

432
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:59,084
and will remain standing
long after we have returned to the dirt.

433
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,083
My father would have liked you.

434
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,002
Who will triumph?

435
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,521
One day your great city
will return to the dirt as well.

436
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,728
- At your command?
- If need be.

437
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,651
A Meereenese champion?

438
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,521
And how many people will die
to make this happen?

439
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,729
If it comes to that,
they will have died for a good reason.

440
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,928
Those men think
they're dying for a good reason.

441
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,650
Someone else's reason.

442
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,326
So your reasons are true
and theirs are false?

443
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,289
They don't know their own minds,
but you do?

444
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,970
Well said. You're an eloquent man.

445
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,804
Doesn't mean you're wrong.

446
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,327
In my experience, eloquent men are right
every bit as often as imbeciles.

447
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,968
Or a Westerosi knight?

448
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,481
I fight and die for your glory,

449
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,890
oh glorious Queen.

450
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,806
- Your Grace...
- Shut your mouth.

451
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,282
- You can end this.
- She cannot.

452
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,044
You can.

453
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,966
Protect your queen!

454
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,284
Go!

455
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,410
Your Grace!

456
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,051
Come with me. I know a way out.
I know a way...

457
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,161
Stay close.

458
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,005
This way.

459
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,201
The other side. Follow me.

460
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,122
Protect your queen!

461
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,849
Drogon!

462
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,246
Valahd.

463
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:12,500
<b><font color=#0E7521>Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
<b><font color=#0E7521>Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

2
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,124
Brace the wind.

3
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,726
The Lord of Light
has made good on his promise, my king.

4
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,804
His fires have melted the snows away.

5
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,291
The way ahead is clear.

6
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,010
We ride for Winterfell.

7
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,246
And you will take it.

8
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,560
The Lord has shown me
Bolton banners burning.

9
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,449
You will receive what is yours by right.

10
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,844
Your Grace?

11
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,410
Prepare to form up.

12
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,845
Your Grace?

13
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,841
Tell me.

14
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,206
The men,

15
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,931
many deserted before dawn.

16
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,724
How many?

17
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,723
Nearly half.

18
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,485
All the sellswords with all the horses.

19
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,481
Your Grace?

20
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,807
Speak up. Can't be worse than mutiny.

21
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,005
Cut her down.

22
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,531
Your Grace?

23
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,648
The Lady Melisandre
was just seen riding out of camp.

24
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,603
Get the men into marching formation.

25
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,648
On to Winterfell.

26
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,084
He raised his hands,

27
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,927
and they all stood up at once.

28
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,087
Tens of thousands of them.
The biggest army in the world.

29
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,202
So what are you gonna do?

30
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,843
I'm gonna hope they don't learn
how to climb the Wall.

31
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,400
But the dragonglass...

32
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,570
No one's ever getting that back now.

33
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,564
It wouldn't have mattered anyway.
Not unless we had a mountain of it.

34
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,325
But you killed a White Walker.

35
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,731
With Longclaw.

36
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,561
I saw them shatter steel axes
like they were glass.

37
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,689
- But Longclaw...
- Is Valyrian steel.

38
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,240
How many Valyrian steel swords
are left in the Seven Kingdoms?

39
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,810
Not enough.

40
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,091
The first Lord Commander in history

41
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,882
to sacrifice the lives of sworn brothers
to save the lives of wildlings.

42
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,603
How's it feel to be friends
with the most hated man in Castle Black?

43
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,489
You were friends with me
when I first came here.

44
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,006
And I wasn't winning any elections back then.

45
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,849
Here's to us, then.

46
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,285
Long may they sneer.

47
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,641
What?

48
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,281
I wanted to ask you something.

49
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,408
To ask something of you.

50
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,124
Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown

51
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,441
so I can become a maester.

52
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,122
That's what I'm meant to be. Not this.

53
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,168
I need you here, Sam.

54
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,563
If you leave,
who's left to give me advice I trust?

55
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,881
Well, there's Edd.

56
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,851
I'd be more use to you as a maester.

57
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,248
More use to everyone
now that Maester Aemon is gone.

58
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,484
The Citadel has the world's greatest library.

59
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:52,404
I'll learn about history, strategy, healing.

60
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,802
And other things,
things that will help when...

61
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,401
When they come.

62
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,526
If Gilly stays here, then she'll die.

63
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,247
And the baby that she
named after me will die.

64
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,244
And I'll end up dying, too,
trying to protect them.

65
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,564
Which means that the last thing
that I'll see in this world

66
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,689
will be the look in her
eyes when I fail them.

67
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,368
And I'd rather see 1,000 White Walkers
than see that.

68
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,565
Thank you.

69
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,561
You know at the Citadel
they'll make you swear off women, too.

70
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,246
On, they'll bloody try.

71
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,361
Sam.

72
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,246
What?

73
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,011
Sam.

74
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,248
You had just been beaten half to death.
How did you...

75
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,401
Oh, very carefully.

76
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,720
I'm glad the end of the world's
working out well for someone.

77
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,570
I'll come back.

78
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,090
To your return.

79
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,285
To my return.

80
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,170
Aye, this way.

81
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,721
My lady!

82
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,525
Stannis.

83
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,887
Stannis Baratheon is coming. His whole army.

84
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,126
How do you know it's Stannis?

85
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,249
He's carrying his flaming heart banners.
From the Blackwater.

86
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,129
I'll never forget it.

87
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,371
Trench here.

88
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,560
Another one 300 yards from the castle wall.
Hurry them along.

89
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,446
- Right, Curlew.
- Yes, sir.

90
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,885
Dig between those two rises.

91
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,291
- Spread out.
- I'm with you.

92
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,128
- Archers!
- Spread out!

93
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,490
And send out a foraging party immediately.
Siege begins at sunrise.

94
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,407
There's not going to be a siege, Your Grace.

95
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,084
We've got no chance!

96
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,764
No, please, please.

97
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,962
Bolton has women fighting for him?

98
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,407
I don't fight for the Boltons.

99
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,642
I'm Brienne of Tarth.

100
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,531
I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon.

101
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,361
I was there when he was murdered
by a shadow with your face.

102
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,802
You murdered him with blood magic?

103
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,526
I did.

104
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,571
In the name of Renly of House Baratheon,

105
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,282
First of His Name, rightful King
of the Andals and the First Men,

106
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,409
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm,

107
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,571
I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die.

108
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,442
Do you have any last words?

109
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,203
Go on, do your duty.

110
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,568
Looks like we're done here.

111
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,404
I surrender! I surrender!

112
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,648
And I accept your surrender.

113
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,010
Let's head back.

114
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,009
My wife must be lonely.

115
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,165
My lady.

116
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,567
I've come to escort you back to your chamber.

117
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,166
Go with her, please.

118
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,729
I know what Ramsay is.

119
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,009
I know what he'll do to me.

120
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,567
If I'm going to die,

121
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,008
let it happen
while there's still some of me left.

122
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,161
Die?

123
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,689
Who said anything about dying?
You can't die.

124
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,491
Your father was Warden of the North.
Ramsay needs you.

125
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,162
Though I suppose he doesn't need all of you.

126
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,322
Just the parts he'll use to make his heir,

127
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,688
until you've given him a boy or two,
and he's finished using them.

128
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,366
Then he's got incredible
plans for those parts.

129
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,571
So, shall we wait for him to come back
or should we begin now?

130
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,042
You're leaving it to me?

131
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,361
Good.

132
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,240
Let's begin.

133
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,969
Reek! Stop!

134
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,564
Open the gate!

135
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,447
He's coming back.

136
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,645
I can see I have my work cut out for me.

137
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,409
You two, out.

138
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,043
You were the first person
on my list, you know.

139
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,051
For killing Syrio Forel. Remember him?

140
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,771
Probably not.

141
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,401
I've gotten a few of the others.

142
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,290
The Many-Faced God
stole a few more from me.

143
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,447
But I'm glad he left me you.

144
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,763
Do you know who I am?

145
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,730
I can't hear you.

146
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,927
You know who I am.

147
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,805
I'm Arya Stark.

148
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,122
Do you know who you are?

149
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,490
You're no one.

150
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,684
You're nothing.

151
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,647
A girl has taken a life.

152
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,050
The wrong life.

153
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,128
I was right about her.

154
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,367
You were.

155
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,970
You're not ready.

156
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,524
Not at all.

157
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,006
That man's life was not yours to take.

158
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,402
A girl stole from the Many-Faced God.

159
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,929
Now a debt is owed.

160
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,284
Only death can pay for life.

161
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,802
No! No!

162
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,451
No, you don't die! Don't die!

163
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,244
Why are you crying?

164
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,810
He was my friend.

165
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,804
No, he wasn't. Didn't you listen to him?

166
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,721
He was no one.

167
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,284
But if you're...

168
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,521
Who's this?

169
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,249
No one at all.

170
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,970
Just as a girl should have been
before she took a face from the hall.

171
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,481
The faces are for no one.

172
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,367
You are still someone.

173
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,969
And to someone,
the faces are as good as poison.

174
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,045
I can't see.

175
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,930
What's happening?

176
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,962
What's happening?

177
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,846
- I wish you a safe journey home.
- Thank you.

178
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,161
Forgive me, child.

179
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,484
I wish you all the happiness in the world.

180
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,330
Maybe I'll come visit you sometime.

181
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,964
Maybe I'll come visit you.

182
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,371
Don't wait too long.

183
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,164
Got a noblewoman to marry back home.

184
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,087
You want a good girl,
but you need the bad pussy.

185
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,121
Whenever you're ready, my lord.

186
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,644
Try not to lose it this time.

187
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,167
I'll never take it off again.

188
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,804
I know you didn't want to leave Dorne,

189
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,087
but I'm glad you're coming home.

190
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,571
Your mother's desperate to see you.

191
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,969
I'm glad Trystane is coming with us.

192
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,121
He seems like a nice boy.

193
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,647
You're lucky.

194
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,368
Arranged marriages are rarely so...

195
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,044
So well arranged.

196
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,884
Do you think Mother will like him?

197
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,363
If she sees you're happy, I'm sure she will.

198
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,369
And you really believe that?

199
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,243
Have you ever known your mother
to like anyone aside from her children?

200
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,529
She likes you.

201
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,762
I'm not so sure about that.

202
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,731
Listen...

203
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,605
There's something I wanted to tell you.

204
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,204
Something I should have told you long ago.

205
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,040
So...

206
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,120
Now that you've seen more of the world,

207
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:02,610
you've learned how complicated
things can be, people can be.

208
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,523
The Lannisters and the Martells
have hated each other for years,

209
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,682
but you've fallen in love with Trystane.

210
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,570
It was an accident, really.
I mean, what were the chances?

211
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,804
You happen to fall in love with the man
you were assigned to marry?

212
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,365
My point is,

213
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,961
we don't choose whom we love.

214
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,681
It just, well...

215
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,442
It's beyond our control.
I sound like an idiot.

216
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,561
No, you don't.

217
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,440
What I'm trying to say...
What I'm trying and failing to say...

218
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,521
I know what you're trying to say.

219
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,125
No, I'm afraid you don't.

220
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,010
I do.

221
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,280
I know.

222
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,161
About you and Mother.

223
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,570
I think a part of me always knew.

224
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,890
And I'm glad.

225
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,406
I'm glad that you're my father.

226
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,925
Myrcella?

227
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,531
Myrcella?

228
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,011
Myrcella? Myrcella?

229
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,482
You love her, don't you?

230
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,290
How could you not?

231
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,964
Of course, it's hopeless for the both of you.

232
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,761
A sellsword from the fighting pits
and a disgraced knight.

233
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,683
Neither one of you is fit
consort for a queen.

234
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,487
But we always want the wrong woman.

235
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,250
Does he always talk so much?

236
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,326
Jorah the Andal.

237
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,125
He should not be here.

238
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,531
No, but he is.

239
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,080
Our queen ordered him exiled from city.

240
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,481
Our queen would be dead if not for him.

241
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,650
It's true. And I would be
dead if not for the...

242
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,526
little man.

243
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,126
Dwarf.

244
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,167
I believe that's the word.

245
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,886
Apologies.

246
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,645
My Valyrian is a bit nostril.

247
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,685
A bit rusty.

248
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,767
Thank you.

249
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,486
I am sorry.

250
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,046
Sorry I not there to fight for our queen.

251
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,566
You missed a good scrap.

252
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,971
None of that matters now.

253
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,724
The longer we sit here bantering,

254
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,286
the longer Daenerys is out there
in the wilderness.

255
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,567
He's right. The dragon headed north.

256
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,563
If we're going to find her,
that's where we'll have to go.

257
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,761
We?

258
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,885
You're a Lannister.

259
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,486
The queen intends to remove
your family from power.

260
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,324
And I intend to help her do it.

261
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,727
You've been here
for how many days now?

262
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,441
I've fought for her for years.
Since she was little more than a child.

263
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,363
- You betrayed her.
- Careful now.

264
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,920
And she exiled you. Twice, I believe.

265
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,490
The second time, thanks to you.

266
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,006
Don't blame me for your crimes, Mormont.

267
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,566
He's right. Our queen exiled Jorah.

268
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,486
And he's right. Jorah saved her life.

269
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,929
Perhaps she feels differently about him now.
Perhaps not.

270
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,570
The only way we'll know is if we ask her.

271
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,767
Fine, fine. I suppose he can join us.

272
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,611
Just as long as he promises
not to kill me in my sleep.

273
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,003
If I ever kill you,
your eyes will be wide open.

274
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,765
Forgive me,
but why would we bring you?

275
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,521
Pardon me?

276
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,523
Have you ever tracked
animals in the wilderness?

277
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,531
Not precisely,
but I have other skills that would be useful.

278
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,090
Can you fight?

279
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,011
I have fought.

280
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,684
I don't claim to be a great warrior.

281
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,966
Are you good on a horse?

282
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,281
Middling.

283
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,600
So mainly you talk.

284
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,841
And drink. I've survived so far.

285
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,766
Which I respect,
but you would not help us on this expedition.

286
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,929
You would help us here in Meereen, though.

287
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,202
None of us have experience
governing a city except for him.

288
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,523
You want to prove your value to the queen?
Prove it right here in Meereen.

289
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,206
He's a foreign dwarf
that barely speaks the language.

290
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,850
Why would the Meereenese listen to him?

291
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,410
They wouldn't.

292
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,604
They will listen to Grey Worm.

293
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,330
I'll come with you.

294
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,329
I'll find our queen.

295
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,841
- You are not strong enough to go anywhere.
- I am.

296
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,287
He is. He's the toughest man
with no balls I ever met.

297
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,803
But you still can't go.

298
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,851
The people believe in you.

299
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,968
They know you speak for the queen.

300
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,806
It's true.

301
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,962
Only the Unsullied
can keep the peace in Meereen.

302
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,409
If you leave,
half this city will consume the other half.

303
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,931
And Missandei.

304
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,684
Our queen trusts no one
more than Missandei.

305
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,570
Certainly not me.

306
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,410
The queen's closest confidante,

307
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,847
the commander of the Unsullied,

308
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,847
and a foreign dwarf with a scarred face.

309
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,685
Good fortune, my friends.

310
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,603
Meereen is ancient and glorious.

311
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,601
Try not to ruin her.

312
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,170
Looks like it's you and me, Jorah the Andal.

313
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,685
Let's find some good horses.

314
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,801
We have so much to talk about.

315
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,530
Hello, old friend.

316
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,046
I thought we were so happy together
until you abandoned me.

317
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,686
I suppose there's no point
asking how you found me.

318
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,331
The birds sing in the west,
the birds sing in the east,

319
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,448
if one knows how to listen.

320
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,645
They tell me you've already found favor
with the Mother of Dragons.

321
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,485
Well, she didn't execute me,

322
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,722
so that's a promising start.

323
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,171
Now the heroes are off to find her,

324
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,527
and I'm stuck here

325
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,610
trying to placate a city
on the brink of civil war.

326
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,410
Any advice for an old comrade?

327
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,851
Information is the key.

328
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,651
You need to learn
your enemy's strengths and strategies.

329
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,200
You need to learn
which of your friends are not your friends.

330
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,561
If only I knew someone
with a vast network of spies.

331
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,005
If only.

332
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,328
A grand old city,

333
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,443
choking on violence, corruption, and deceit.

334
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:35,890
Who could possibly have any experience
managing such a massive, ungainly beast?

335
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,127
I did miss you.

336
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,129
Oh, I know.

337
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,289
We have to go home.

338
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,644
Oh, my poor, sweet thing.

339
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,970
Does it hurt?

340
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,689
We have to go home.

341
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,160
Drogon.

342
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,647
Can you take me back to Meereen?

343
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,082
How far did you carry me?

344
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,925
Drogon, we need to return.

345
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,365
My people need me.

346
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,563
Well, there's no food.

347
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,483
At the very least,
you could hunt us some supper.

348
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,405
Confess.

349
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,731
Confess.

350
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,651
I have sinned.

351
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,090
I see that now.

352
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,645
How can I have been so blind for so long?

353
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,127
I want to be clean again.

354
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,930
I want absolution.

355
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,764
The Crone came to me
with her lamp raised high.

356
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,807
And by its holy light...

357
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,325
You wish to make a confession?

358
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,167
Once I've confessed, will I be free?

359
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,602
Your Grace will be dealt with
according to her sins.

360
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,728
The Mother have mercy, then.

361
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,010
I lay with a man outside
the bonds of marriage. I confess.

362
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,930
Name him.

363
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,281
Lancel Lannister.

364
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,410
Your cousin and the king's squire.

365
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,048
- I was lonely and afraid.
- You had a husband.

366
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,487
A husband off whoring every chance he...

367
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,642
His sins do not pardon your own.

368
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,768
May the gods forgive me.

369
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,244
Other men?

370
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,841
No.

371
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,840
No others?

372
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,920
No.

373
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,087
Speaking falsehoods
before the gods is a great crime.

374
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,571
You understand this?

375
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,290
I do.

376
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,841
There are those that say your children
were not fathered by King Robert,

377
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,760
that they are bastards
born of incest and adultery.

378
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,080
A lie.

379
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,604
A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon.

380
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,729
He wants the throne,
but his brother's children stand in his way.

381
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,531
So he claims they are not his brother's.

382
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,491
That filth.

383
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,686
There is not one shred of truth to it.

384
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,205
I deny it.

385
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,926
Good.

386
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,407
But these are terrible charges.

387
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,481
And the realm must know the truth of them.

388
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,168
If Your Grace has given honest testimony,
your trial will prove your innocence.

389
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,208
Trial? I have confessed.

390
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,603
To a single sin.

391
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,881
Others you have denied.

392
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,161
Your trial will separate the truths
from the falsehoods.

393
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,727
I bow to the wisdom of Your High Holiness.

394
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,410
But if I might beg

395
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,560
for just one drop of the Mother's mercy.

396
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,883
I haven't seen my son...

397
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,247
I don't know how long it's been.

398
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,608
I need to see him, please.

399
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,241
You have taken the first step
on the path back to righteousness.

400
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,282
In light of this,

401
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,727
I will permit you to return to the Red Keep.

402
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,771
Thank you.

403
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,566
Thank you.

404
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,610
The Mother is merciful.

405
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,884
It is her you should thank.

406
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,724
I will. I will.

407
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,528
I swear it, day and night.

408
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,560
Good.

409
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,764
Am I free to go?

410
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,083
After your atonement.

411
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,170
My atonement?

412
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,368
A sinner comes before you.

413
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,730
Cersei of House Lannister.

414
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,882
Mother to His Grace King Tommen.

415
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,761
Widow of His Grace King Robert.

416
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,567
She has committed the acts
of falsehood and fornication.

417
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,491
She has confessed her sins

418
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,329
and begged for forgiveness.

419
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,007
To demonstrate her repentance,

420
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:34,130
she will cast aside all pride, all artifice,

421
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,610
and present herself as the gods made her

422
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,531
to you,

423
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,527
the good people of the city.

424
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,964
She comes before you with a solemn heart,

425
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,443
shorn of secrets,

426
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:53,245
naked before the eyes of gods and men,

427
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,291
to make her walk of atonement.

428
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,327
Shame. Shame.

429
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,245
Shame.

430
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,331
Shame.

431
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,281
Shame.

432
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,725
Shame.

433
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,284
Shame.

434
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,971
Shame.

435
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,487
Shame.

436
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,526
Shame.

437
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,801
Shame.

438
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,009
Shame.

439
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,561
Shame.

440
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,851
Shame.

441
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,364
Shame.

442
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,365
Shame.

443
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,247
Shame.

444
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,609
Shame.

445
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,721
Shame.

446
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,761
Shame.

447
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,404
Shame.

448
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,600
Shame.

449
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,445
- Cunt!
- Shame.

450
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,760
- Sinner!
- Whore!

451
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,365
- Shame.
- Whore!

452
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,051
Shame.

453
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,687
- Whore!
- Whore!

454
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,886
Shame.

455
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:18,961
Bitch.

456
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,686
Shame.

457
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,486
Shame.

458
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,766
- Whore!
- Sinner!

459
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,207
- Shame.
- Bitch! Brother fucker!

460
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,810
- Whore!
- Shame.

461
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,962
- Fuck off!
- Shame.

462
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,001
Shame.

463
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,321
- All hail the royal tits.
- You're a bitch!

464
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,561
Shame.

465
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,801
- Get her!
- Whore!

466
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,450
- Bitch!
- Fucker!

467
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,170
- Fucker!
- You bitch!

468
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,730
- Shame.
- Cunt!

469
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,245
Shame.

470
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,727
Shame. Shame.

471
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,208
- Brother fucker!
- Bitch!

472
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,167
I've had half as many cocks as the queen.

473
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,561
Shame.

474
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,329
- Whore! Sinner!
- Slut!

475
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,601
Shame.

476
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,366
Shame. Shame.

477
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,605
- Whore!
- Whore, whore.

478
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,605
I'm a Lannister. Suck me off!

479
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,884
- Suck me off, you bitch!
- Back!

480
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,729
- Whore!
- Shame.

481
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,806
Shame.

482
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,205
Whore! Whore! Whore! Whore!

483
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,006
Shame.

484
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,120
Shame.

485
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,560
Shame.

486
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,886
Shame.

487
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,681
Shame.

488
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:41,961
Shame.

489
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,371
- Bitch!
- Shame.

490
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,330
Brother fucker!

491
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:59,523
Shame. Shame.

492
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,046
Shame.

493
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,528
- Brother fucker!
- Whore!

494
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,284
- Whore!
- Shame.

495
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,726
Shame. Shame.

496
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,051
Shame.

497
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,481
Shame.

498
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,321
Shame.

499
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,291
Shame.

500
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,286
Shame.

501
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,122
- Shame.
- Fucker!

502
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,841
Shame. Shame.

503
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,441
Shame.

504
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,561
Shame.

505
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,521
Shame.

506
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,441
Shame. Shame.

507
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,651
Shame.

508
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,524
Shame. Shame.

509
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,521
Shame.

510
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,485
Shame.

511
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,891
Shame.

512
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,805
Shame.

513
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,761
Shame.

514
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,206
Shame.

515
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,441
Shame.

516
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,645
Shame.

517
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,485
Shame. Shame.

518
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,971
Shame.

519
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:01,966
Your Grace.

520
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,282
It's good to have you back.

521
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,610
Come.

522
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,205
We'll take you inside.

523
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,611
I need to have a look at those feet.

524
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:28,122
May I have the honor of presenting
the newest member of the Kingsguard?

525
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,966
If it please Your Grace,
he has taken a holy vow of silence.

526
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,929
He has sworn that he will not speak

527
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,810
until all His Grace's enemies are dead,

528
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,770
and evil has been driven from the realm.

529
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,881
Who came to your aid? Stannis.

530
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,086
Now he needs you.

531
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,685
We don't have enough men
to make any difference.

532
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,250
The wildlings will make a difference.

533
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,890
The wildlings will never fight for Stannis.

534
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,691
- I told him before...
- You saved their bloody lives.

535
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,562
If they're gonna live in the Seven Kingdoms,

536
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,962
safe behind our Wall,
they ought to fight for the damn place.

537
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,691
- It's not their fight.
- Open the gates!

538
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,681
Stannis?

539
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,771
Shireen? The princess?

540
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,727
Lord Commander.

541
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,489
It's one of the wildlings you brought back.
Says he knows your Uncle Benjen.

542
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,205
Says he's still alive.

543
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,924
Are you sure he's talking about Benjen?

544
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,771
Said he was First Ranger.

545
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,441
Said he knows where to find him.

546
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:14,400
Man says he saw your uncle at Hardhome
at the last full moon.

547
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,445
- Could be lying.
- Could be.

548
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,800
There are ways to find out.

549
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,803
- Where is he?
- Over there.

550
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,651
For the Watch.

551
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,606
For the Watch.

552
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,806
For the Watch.

553
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,529
For the Watch.

554
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:55,891
For the Watch.

555
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,361
Olly...

556
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,210
For the Watch.

557
